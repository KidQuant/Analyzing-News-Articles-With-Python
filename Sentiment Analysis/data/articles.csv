3742,"Inside Trump's proposal to suspend some legal immigration amid coronavirus crisis""",Reuters,4/24/2020,,,https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN22539S,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Wednesday that temporarily blocks some foreigners outside the United States from obtaining U.S. permanent residency, a move he said would protect American workers amid the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.

The executive order included a number of exemptions and was not a full suspension of legal immigration, as suggested by a Trump tweet late on Monday night.
Here is what Trump’s order does and does not do.
WHO WILL BE AFFECTED?
The order blocks some foreigners outside the United States from settling permanently in the United States by obtaining what is informally known as a “green card.”
The measure applies to both requests for permanent residence based on employment in the United States and requests based on familial ties but contains a number of exceptions.
The order does not affect people coming to the United States on non-immigrant visas, including tourists and business travelers. It also does not affect workers such as farm laborers entering the United States on temporary visas or skilled workers on H-1B visas.
Foreigners already in the United States and seeking to adjust their status will not be blocked by the latest measure.
The vast majority of employment-based green cards are granted to people inside the United States, and thereby not covered by the ban. Most family-based green cards are granted to people outside the country, however.
The immediate impact of the order was not clear since most U.S. consulates around the world have already shuttered most immigration processing services.
WHO IS EXEMPT?
Doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals will be exempt, as will other prospective immigrants coming to the country to perform “essential” work to combat the new coronavirus, as determined by federal agencies.
The measure also excludes immigrants applying for the EB-5 visa program, which allows foreigners willing to invest large sums of money in U.S. projects that create or preserve jobs to obtain permanent residence.
The order makes an exception for spouses of U.S. citizens and their unmarried children under the age of 21.
The measure contains several other exemptions, including a general exemption for “any alien whose entry would be in the national interest.”
HOW LONG WILL THE SUSPENSION LAST?
The suspension will begin just before midnight on Thursday and last 60 days. After that, Trump will review U.S. economic conditions and decide whether it should be extended. Future extensions could potentially be longer than 60 days, Trump said this week.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKERS?
The executive order states that the administration will review all temporary visa programs - including guest worker programs - to determine if additional steps should be taken to protect U.S. workers.
A senior administration official told Reuters this week that the White House was considering a separate action that could deal with skilled workers who enter the country on H-1B visas and others affected by U.S. immigration policy.
DOES TRUMP HAVE THE POWER TO SUSPEND IMMIGRATION?
Trump’s latest immigration order draws on the same legal authority his administration cited in its 2017 travel ban that suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations. While that policy cited security concerns, critics dubbed it a “Muslim ban.”
Federal judges blocked several iterations of the ban from taking effect, but the Supreme Court eventually upheld a reworked version of the measure in 2018 and it continues to be in force and was expanded in January.
Some legal experts argue the high court’s ruling does not permit a broad, worldwide ban on immigration into the United States and expect Trump’s latest order to be challenged in court.
WHAT DOES IMMIGRATION LOOK LIKE NOW?
The United States suspended routine visa services in most countries worldwide in mid-March due to the coronavirus outbreak, which was expected to dramatically slow legal immigration.
In addition, countries around the world have closed their borders and enacted quarantines to limit the spread of the virus, greatly reducing travel worldwide.
Amid the global slowdown, the number of permanent residency visas issued by the State Department fell to around 24,000 in March, a 35% decrease from the previous month, according to department statistics published on Thursday.
The number of temporary visas issued also decreased by roughly a third.
WOULD BLOCKING IMMIGRANTS HELP THE ECONOMY?
Trump said on Tuesday that an immigration suspension would protect U.S. workers, an extension of the message he employed during his 2016 presidential campaign.
However, researchers generally agree that immigration into the United States has actually stimulated economic growth, increased the size of the economy and created jobs, according to Giovanni Peri, an economics professor at the University of California, Davis.
“The idea that immigration threatens American jobs is just not there in any data,” he said."

(CNN) At 10:06 p.m. EST on Monday, the lives of thousands of existing and would-be immigrants to the United States were suddenly thrown into further disarray in the midst of a global crisis. At that time, President Donald Trump tweeted that in order to ""protect the jobs of GREAT American citizens,"" he would be suspending immigration to the United States. On Tuesday evening, he provided further details , saying he would order a 60-day pause that would apply only to people seeking green cards to become permanent US residents. It was unclear whether temporary workers would be affected.
This imminent suspension of the issuance of work visas and green cards for employment-based immigrants shows -- among other things - how the Trump administration is planning to use the Covid-19 pandemic to further its agenda of severely limiting immigration to the United States.
In-person immigration processing had already been suspended owing to the virus, following the closure of consulates and United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) processing centers. However, the suspension of processing, which has been in place for several weeks, differs from the hold on green card applications that has just been announced by the President, in that it's a cessation based on policy desires and not pandemic-related closures. In the former case, those waiting for new visas and those whose H-1B visas were running out were given a 60 day period in which to file their claims. During that time, they could remain in the country. It now seems those temporary residents may not be affected immediately by the executive order. However, many of those visa holders would have been waiting to convert their status to permanent residency; the typical H1-B or O visa-holder who applies for a green card is very likely to be a skilled or talented professional who has lived and worked in the US for several years. With the President's announcement, those applicants for new visas will be thrown into chaos and may well have to leave.
In a statement following the President's Monday tweet, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany stated that the move was made to protect ""the health and economic well-being of Americans,"" a veiled but transparent reference to the virus -- though the United States has the highest number of cases globally. Her statement said further: ""Decades of record immigration had produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers.""
This White House line claiming that immigration hurts American citizens is incorrect. A National Bureau of Economic Research study, which looked at the impact of immigration on US workers between 1990-2004 (the years of highest immigration to the United States), found that the wages of American-born workers actually increased owing to immigration.
Beyond the mistruths offered to justify it, this action on immigration is likely to be yet another shock to the already flailing economy. Now suddenly US employers that were relying on talented employees being able to convert their status so they could remain in the US will face terrible uncertainty. Answering questions about the imminent order on Tuesday, President Trump said his first priority was ensuring American citizens had jobs.
The H-1B (or highly skilled worker) visa holders who are in line for green cards face the worst of this chaos; they could now lose their place in line and may have to leave the lives they have established in the US to return to their countries of origin. In an instant, their lives and futures have been upended and now hinge on the wording of the President's expected executive order.
The White House statement provides no information on how so many people will actually be removed from the United States in the coming months, when travel is limited and some borders are closed. One crucial question is how the sudden exit of so many middle-class temporary visa holders will affect the communities they live in, let alone the businesses they frequent or the faith communities they participate in. How many of these temporary visa holders are health workers who are desperately needed now? Unless the White House lifts the suspension or doesn't implement it at all, the country will likely be faced with the collective exodus of millions in the coming months.
They are easy victims. While temporary work visa holders can file cases in federal court challenging the President's order, they are in relatively weak legal positions. Visas are granted entirely at the discretion of the issuing government and are not subject to discrimination claims as would be the case if the petitioners were US citizens. US companies whose operations will be significantly destabilized by the order do have the ability to challenge the directive but that litigation, if it is ever filed, will likely take some time to make its way through the court system.
All of this will allow President Trump to win points with his largely immigrant-hating base. In the days before the President's tweet, right-wing groups were demanding an end to employment-based immigration. Earlier this month, US Tech Workers, a tech workers group that favors limiting immigration, posted a letter to President Trump asking him to suspend the yearly grant of 65,000 H-1B visas. A few days ago, former attorney general (and ex-Trump supporter) Jeff Sessions, long an anti-immigration hardliner, demanded that the President halt all employment-based immigration to the United States and ""put Americans and not foreign workers first"". This collective chorus, along with a push by Trump's de facto anti-immigrant czar Stephen Miller, have now all borne fruit, producing at the stroke of a tweet the most sweeping suggested transformation of the American immigration system in modern history.
Not only is the fallacy that immigrants reduce the wages of native-born Americans wrong, so too is the simplistic assumption that all jobs vacated by these workers will instantly be filled by a deserving native-born American. It is not only tech workers who hold temporary work visas, it is also professors, researchers doing highly specialized work, exceptionally talented writers, musicians and others. The work they do is not necessarily replicable or interchangeable and the jobs they do will likely not be filled after they leave. The intellectual cost of potentially losing their contributions, on the other hand, will not only set US innovation back by years, it will mean that research ventures will no longer want to locate their most crucial projects in the United States. Without the possibility of becoming US citizens, exceptionally gifted and talented immigrations, the ones eligible for ""O"" visas, may not want to bring their talents to us after all.

Such an action from the President would essentially render the America most of us know, long the nation of immigrants and home to innovation and diversity, unrecognizable. Even worse, the terribly high rates of unemployment that are likely to emerge out of the Covid-19 crisis will make it difficult for a potential Democratic President like Joe Biden to undo or easily unravel the disastrous impact of such an illogical move. The system of employment-based immigration that rewards technical expertise, hard work, research and artistic excellence is complex and interconnected -- far easier to destroy rather than to reconstruct.
As of now, it's still unclear what any executive order would look like or how feasible its immediate implementation would be. But one thing is crystal clear. Under the cover of attending to the employment impact of Covid-19, the Trump administration has initiated changes that could transform the way America looks and works and thinks for a long time to come."
2269,Just imagine if Trump had stopped immigration in early February',Washington Examiner,4/24/2020,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/just-imagine-if-trump-had-stopped-immigration-in-early-february,"President Trump announced Monday night that he plans to “temporarily suspend immigration” into the United States.
In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2020
There are tons of valid questions about the legality and the mechanism of this supposed suspension, and like many tweeted promises of Trump, this might never really happen.
Here’s my question: Given how fiercely Trump has always spoken about the threats from immigration, why did he not take earlier and stronger steps to close our borders and limit foreign travel into the country?
Yes, he issued a “travel ban” on China shortly after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global health emergency. But that has been porous. Reportedly, 40,000 people have entered the U.S. from China since then, and the original plan didn't put a special system in place to isolate returning Americans. Later, he issued European travel bans on March 11, but by then, the virus was already in the U.S. and spreading.
And yes, these restrictions were decried in the media as xenophobic, and those proposing travel bans earlier were called worse. Tom Cotton’s proposed travel ban in late January triggered a small rash of coronavirus-is-only-scary-if-you’re-racist pieces in the liberal media.
But if Trump were the guy he promised to be, and the guy the media often demonized him as being, he would have done a lot more, a lot earlier, on restricting entry in order to minimize invasion of the coronavirus.
Cotton, for instance, was calling for a ban on travel from China back on Jan. 22.
A week before, the first cases showed up outside of China, including in the U.S. What if, at that point (before the WHO declared it a global emergency), Trump had barred all entry from China? And what if when Europe started reporting deaths (Feb. 14 in France), Trump had simply closed off all entry into America?
By that point, only 12 cases had been identified in the U.S. It would have been an extreme step for Trump on Feb. 14 to ban all entry to the U.S. Of course, lots of complicated steps would have to be taken for U.S. citizens and residents who were traveling overseas, but imagine we started screening and even quarantining those few people that we allowed in. Taiwan did something like this.
Again, this is far stricter than anything any Western country has done, but Trump ran as an extraordinary immigration restrictionist.
Had Trump barred entry from China in late January (during impeachment) and then entry from every other country in mid-February, the media firestorm would have been immense.
Thanks to the Trump Effect (the magic power by which Trump controls the media’s opinion by driving them to declare the opposite of whatever he’s professing), we would have been bombarded with stories about how the virus wasn’t a big threat, China was containing it well, and Trump’s actions were counterproductive. More stories about Trump “sealing the U.S. off from the world"" and about how we would suffer from “leaving the global community.”
Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders would have reamed Trump for the shutdown. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would have held pro-immigration rallies.
And then, over the course of March, the coronavirus spread throughout Europe and Asia. But if we combined an entry ban with contact tracing and quarantining, we could have minimized the need for lockdowns and still greatly suppressed the spread of the virus.
So right about now, we might have the virus under control, while most of the rest of the world was in lockdown with death tolls climbing, and Trump would have owned the libs beyond his wildest dreams.
But Trump spent much of the winter watching his impeachment and saying nice things about China, in part because he wanted a trade deal. His travel bans were porous and late. It’s sort of the story of his whole administration: Trump crafts an image of himself as someone who will most divide the country (earning plaudits from his base and bile from the media), but he never lives up, or down, to that self-crafted image."

An executive order suspending all immigration to the country would take the president’s impulses to an untested extreme.
AD
AD
Two White House officials said an executive order is being drafted and that Trump could sign it as soon as Tuesday. The order, which was discussed among senior staff members Monday, would suspend nearly all immigration under the rationale of preventing the spread of infection by foreigners arriving from abroad.
The United States currently has more confirmed coronavirus cases, by far, than any other country, with more than 775,000; the next highest country is Spain, with 200,000 cases. The United States also has far more confirmed virus-related deaths — more than 42,000 — than any other nation; Italy has more than 24,000 deaths and Spain just fewer than 21,000.
It remains unclear what exceptions Trump could include in such a sweeping immigration order, or if would-be immigrants could reach the United States by demonstrating they are free of the virus. The White House officials said they thought the order would not be in place long-term.

The president’s announcement caught some senior Department of Homeland Security officials off guard, and the agency did not respond to questions and requests to explain Trump’s plan late Monday.
The United States already has placed broad restrictions on travel from Europe, China and other pandemic hot spots, while implementing strict controls at the country’s land borders. International air travel has plummeted.
Halting immigration to the United States ould affect hundreds of thousands of visa holders and other would-be green card recipients who are planning and preparing to come to the United States at any given time. Most of them are the family members of Americans.

For Trump’s executive order to work, it would have to direct the State Department and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to immediately stop the issuance of immigration visas. Such a move appears to have no modern precedent and would potentially leave the fiancees, children and other close relatives of U.S. citizens in limbo.
AD
The State Department issued about 460,000 immigration visas last year, and USCIS processed nearly 580,000 green card approvals for foreigners who applied for permanent residency, the latest U.S. statistics show.
Alex Nowrasteh, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said that the president likely does have the authority to issue such an order during a time of crisis.
AD
Nowrasteh said there are at least two legal justifications for Trump to close the border to all immigration: Title 42 of the U.S. Code enables the president to halt immigration for health reasons, while a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding his travel ban gives him legal precedent.
If such an order were in fact signed, it would be unprecedented in American history, Nowrasteh said. During the height of the 1918 flu pandemic, the United States allowed more than 110,000 immigrants to enter the country.
And during World War II, the United States accepted more than 170,000 immigrants with green cards and more than 227,000 temporary agricultural workers, mostly from Mexico, on the bracero guest worker visa program.
The president already has largely halted most forms of immigration into the United States, Nowrasteh said. This latest move continues his restrictionist immigration policies and takes them to a new level, using the pandemic as the reasoning.
AD
AD
On March 18, the State Department canceled most routine immigrant and nonimmigrant visa appointments at its offices overseas, effectively shutting down almost all new kinds of travel into the United States. The State Department also stopped all processing for refugee resettlement.
Later that week, however, authorities resumed processing H-2A visas for seasonal guest workers. The country's agricultural laborers have been officially declared “essential workers,” including hundreds of thousands of people who enter the country under that temporary visa.
Nowrasteh said he was surprised that it took Trump so long to use the pandemic and the cause of public health as justification to achieve one of his highest policy priorities.
AD
“The president has been opposed to legal immigration for his entire administration,” he said. “This is an opportunity to close it down entirely, and this is about as legitimate as you can get in terms of a broad justification for doing so.”
AD
Trump already has cited the health emergency to enact the kind of enforcement measures at the U.S. border with Mexico he has long extolled, moves that have essentially closed the border to asylum seekers and waved off anti-trafficking protections for underage migrants. During the past few weeks of the coronavirus crisis, U.S. border authorities have expelled 10,000 border crossers in an average of just a little more than an hour and a half each, which has effectively emptied out U.S. Border Patrol holding facilities of detainees.
U.S. border authorities say the measures are in place to help federal agents, health-care workers and the public by preventing potentially infected migrants from crossing into the United States, while minimizing the population of detainees in U.S. immigration jails.

3648,U.S. coronavirus response deepens divide as Trump suspends immigration',Reuters,4/21/2020,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/u-s-coronavirus-response-deepens-divide-as-trump-suspends-immigration-idUSKCN2231TU,"ATLANTA (Reuters) - Governors of about half a dozen U.S. states pushed ahead on Tuesday with plans to partially reopen for business despite warnings by some health officials that doing so could trigger a new surge in coronavirus cases.
The easing of sweeping restrictions in Georgia, South Carolina and other mostly Southern U.S. states follows protests against rules imposed during the pandemic that shut down businesses and largely confined residents to their homes.
A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed a majority of Americans believed stay-at-home orders should remain in place until public health officials determine lifting them is safe, despite the damage to the U.S. economy.
“It’s a matter of concern, this whole idea of opening up. It’s based on non-science generated parameters,” Dr. Boris Lushniak, dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Health, told Reuters in an interview.
Deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by coronavirus, topped 45,150 nationwide as cases climbed to over 810,000, according to a Reuters tally.
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan each reported their highest single-day coronavirus-related death tolls - over 800 between the three states. New York state, the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, reported 481 new deaths.
Governors are under pressure from businesses and some constituents to relax stay-at-home orders that have thrown over 20 million people out of work in the past month alone.
In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers who filed a lawsuit against Democratic Governor Tony Evers, challenging his stay-at-home order that runs until May 26.
CDC WARNS OF FALL OUTBREAK
Tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, and local officials have risen over the U.S. government’s role in ramping up testing, which infectious disease experts say is key to enable a safe reopening.
Those experts say the United States, with a population of nearly 330 million people, should test 3 million per week to get an accurate sense of the virus’s reach. States have tested only a third of that number in the past seven days, according to the Covid Tracking Project.
Even as states move ahead with plans to reopen, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned a second wave of the coronavirus could be worse if it coincides with the start of seasonal flu season.
“There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,” CDC Director Robert Redfield said in an interview with The Washington Post.
Georgia is among a half dozen states that will allow more business activity this week or next.
Brian Kemp, Georgia’s Republican governor, will allow gyms, hair salons, bowling alleys, tattoo and massage parlors to reopen on Friday, followed by movie houses and restaurants next week.
Kemp said his plan balances public health with the need to reignite the state’s economy, saying social distancing rules would remain in place.

Georgia has reported 174 positive cases and six deaths per 100,000 people, both below the national average, according to a Reuters analysis of data collected by the Covid Tracking Project.But the state also has one of the lowest testing rates, giving health officials less data on the reach of the illness to base decisions on reopening, the data showed.
“Don’t go out,” Savannah Mayor Van Johnson, a Democrat, told residents of the eastern Georgia city during a news conference. “People will not come here if they think our businesses are not safe.”
CUOMO MEETS TRUMP
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo emerged from a meeting with Trump at the White House and said the president had agreed to help his state procure chemical reagents and other supplies needed to double testing capacity.
Cuomo said it was up to his state to help labs boost their testing capacity and to organize the workers needed to take more samples.
“That is an intelligent division of labor,” Cuomo said at a press briefing. “Let each level of government do what it does best.”
The governor said New York would try to double the number of people it tests each day - including diagnostic and antibody tests - to 40,000, characterizing the task as an “enormous undertaking” that would take weeks.
Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom of California, the most populous U.S. state, said despite evidence the outbreak was slowing there, cases and deaths were still rising.
Over the seven-day period ending on Sunday night, the number of deaths in California nearly doubled, and the number of new cases increased by nearly 50%, state data showed.

Newsom promised to release a detailed plan for testing and reopening on Wednesday, but cautioned it was too soon to loosen public health restrictions.
In Washington, D.C., the U.S. Senate unanimously approved $484 billion in additional coronavirus relief for the U.S. economy and hospitals treating patients sickened by the pandemic, sending the measure to the House of Representatives for final passage later this week.

UPDATE, April 21, 2020 at 6:58 p.m. ET : President Trump has clarified that his 60-day immigration pause, at least for now, will apply only to people seeking permanent residence in the United States.
Original story below:
President Trump announced late Monday he will soon sign an executive order ""to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States,"" in what appeared to be a drastic escalation of his efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic and boost the economy.
The declaration came hours after U.S. equity markets plunged, with oil prices turning negative for the first time in history. Also on Monday, three states -- Georgia, Tennessee, and South Carolina -- revealed plans to begin reopening some businesses.
""In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!"" the president tweeted.
The precise contours of the president's planned executive order were not immediately clear. The White House did not immediately elaborate on Trump's tweeted announcement.
Politico reported that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was still working out the details of the executive order, and that an exemption for temporary guest workers, including farm workers, was under consideration.
A top DHS official told the outlet that “22 million unemployed Americans and counting due to COVID-19"" had prompted Trump to act.
Due to the pandemic, almost all visa processing by the State Department, including immigrant visas, has been suspended for weeks.
Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Arizona, applauded the planned executive order, and suggested a total immigration suspension should continue indefinitely. ""Thank you, @realDonaldTrump!"" he wrote. ""All immigration to the United States should halt until every American who wants a job has one!""
""Given tens of millions of Americans are out of work right now and we’re battling a virus that spreads through human-to-human transmission I am dying to hear one coherent argument against this,"" wrote Spectator USA's Washington editor Amber Athey.
Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., meanwhile, said Trump was looking for ""someone to blame for his own failure.""
CORONAVIRUS TIMELINE SHOWS MULTIPLE FLIP-FLOPS BY JOURNOS, DEMS, GOP
""Immigration has nearly stopped and the US has far more cases than any other country,"" Beyer wrote, without adjusting his statistic to consider the larger population in the United States. ""This is just xenophobic scapegoating.""
Added Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.: ""Trump failed to take this crisis seriously from day 1. His abandonment of his role as president has cost lives. And now, he's shamelessly politicizing this pandemic to double down on his anti-immigrant agenda. Enough, Mr. President. The American people are fed up.""
Aside from the pending immigration ban, the U.S. has already enacted a slew of entry restrictions. The U.S. recently agreed with both Canada and Mexico to extend border restrictions on nonessential travel for another 30 days, through May 16 and May 19, respectively.
However, people with temporary work visas, students and business travelers were exempted, along with emergency personnel.
The president has also already has blocked most travel from other hotspots, including most of Europe, Iran, South Korea, and China.
AOC CELEBRATES OIL CRASH IN NOW-DELETED TWEET
More than 750,000 Americans have come down with COVID-19 and more than 42,000 have died. On Monday, the U.S. government said it will continue to quickly expel migrants it encounters along the border with Mexico for at least another month in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.
Under the U.S. policy change spurred by the virus, the U.S. government has sent some 10,000 Mexicans and Central Americans back to Mexico, according to data from the U.S.Border Patrol.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) says that more than 100 migrants at 25 detention centers have tested positive for COVID-19. Guatemala claims that 44 migrants deported from the U.S. tested positive.
Monday's immigration suspension was likely to draw legal challenges, and reignite an already heated debate over travel restrictions. On Jan. 31, Trump issued the ""Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus,"" blocking most travel from China -- and at the time, Democrats harshly criticized the move.
Within hours, Joe Biden campaigned in Iowa and told the crowd that Americans “need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it. ... This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.”
Months later, Biden said he supported the China travel ban.

The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York overturned a lower court ruling that stopped the administration’s 2017 move to withhold grant money from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, which dispenses over $250 million a year to state and local criminal justice efforts.
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO DEPLOY BORDER PATROL TO SANCTUARY CITIES TO HELP ICE CATCH ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
“Today’s decision rightfully recognizes the lawful authority of the Attorney General to ensure that Department of Justice grant recipients are not at the same time thwarting federal law enforcement priorities,” a DOJ spokesman said in a statement. “The grant conditions here require states and cities that receive DOJ grants to share information about criminals in custody. The federal government uses this information to enforce national immigration laws--policies supported by successive Democrat and Republican administrations.”
“All Americans will benefit from increased public safety as this Administration is able to implement its lawful immigration and public safety policies,” the statement said.
The latest decision conflicts with rulings from other appeals courts across the country concerning sanctuary policies, indicating a Supreme Court review is ultimately likely.
New York City and liberal states including New York, Washington, Massachusetts and Connecticut sued the government, and the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York backed them — ordering the money be released and stopping the government from putting immigration-related conditions on grants.
But the appeals court ruled that it “cannot agree that the federal government must be enjoined from imposing the challenged conditions on the federal grants here at issue.”
“These conditions help the federal government enforce national immigration laws and policies supported by successive Democratic and Republican administrations,” the court ruled. “But more to the authorization point, they ensure that applicants satisfy particular statutory grant requirements imposed by Congress and subject to Attorney General oversight.”
It also disagreed with the district court’s claim that the conditions intrude on powers reserved only to states, noting that in immigration policy the Supreme Court has found that the federal government maintains “broad” and “preeminent” power.
The ruling marks a key win for the administration in its efforts to crack down on the continued use of “sanctuary” policies that limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities in order to shield illegal immigrants from deportation.
ICE SUBPOENAS NY FOR INFO ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ACCUSED OF MURDER, AS SANCTUARY CITY FIGHT ESCALATES
The Heritage Foundation’s Mike Howell, a former member of Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Legal Counsel, told Fox News that the ruling is potentially an important development considering the dependence of states like New York on DOJ grant money.
“When you look at the amount of money that flows in via grants generally, the federal government has a lot of power over states and localities,” he said. “If you open the door to the federal government being able to condition that grant money, it’s a huge deal.”
Sanctuary policies generally forbid local law enforcement from honoring detainers -- requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that they be alerted to of an illegal immigrant’s release from custody so they can be be picked up by ICE and put through deportation proceedings.
Proponents of the policies claim it makes cities safer because it encourages illegal immigrants to cooperate with police without fear of deportation. But the Trump administration has been relentlessly pushing back by highlighting cases in which criminals are released onto the streets only to re-offend.
It has also deployed a series of measures to combat the practice, including deploying elite Border Patrol agents to sanctuary cities to help ICE track down and detain illegal immigrants.

The Justice Department recently announced a slew of measures, and President Trump has called on Congress to pass legislation that would allow victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants to sue sanctuary cities and states.
“Not one more American life should be stolen by sanctuary cities; they’re all over the place and a lot of people don’t want them,” Trump said at the State of the Union address this month.

6139,Court rules Trump administration can withhold funds from sanctuary cities',Axios,2/26/2020,,,https://www.axios.com/court-trump-immigration-sanctuary-cities-565ee05c-46ea-4894-8e1b-52f6a0fde7c8.html,"The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration can withhold millions of dollars in federal law enforcement grants from sanctuary cities and states that don't cooperate with immigration enforcement, AP reports.
The state of play: Seven states and New York City sued the U.S. government after the Justice Department said in 2017 it would withhold funds from cities and states that don't give immigration enforcement officials access to jails or notice when an undocumented migrant is scheduled to be released from jail, per AP.
The big picture: The decision conflicts with the rulings of three other federal appeals courts and comes amid an ongoing dispute between the Trump administration and sanctuary cities, which restrict cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration officials.
The Department of Homeland Security recently suspended New York residents from enrolling in Global Entry and other Trusted Traveler Programs because of a state law preventing federal immigration officials from accessing vehicle records without a court order.
Between the lines: While this is an important win for the Trump administration, it likely can't begin acting on the decision yet because of nationwide injunctions in other cases.

4791,Administration to Divert Billions From Pentagon to Fund Border Wall',New York Times (Online News),2/14/2020,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/us/politics/border-wall-funds-pentagon.html,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon plans to divert $3.8 billion intended for military equipment to the construction of a wall at the southwestern border, it informed lawmakers on Thursday, drawing bipartisan outrage and reviving a long-running battle with Congress over funding for President Trump’s signature campaign promise.
The formal notification to Congress on Thursday, which was obtained by The New York Times, was the latest bid by Mr. Trump’s administration to circumvent congressional control of federal spending and unilaterally seize funds that lawmakers had designated for other purposes to finance the construction of the wall. The move came on the same day that Mr. Trump confirmed that the national emergency he had declared almost exactly a year ago to allow him to take money Congress had allocated for other purposes and spend it on the border wall would remain in place for another year.
The Pentagon’s decision to divert funds was greeted on Thursday with criticism by a few prominent members of Mr. Trump’s party, who joined Democrats in saying the president’s team had overstepped its constitutional authority by second-guessing congressional spending decisions.
“Once those choices have been made, the Department of Defense cannot change them in pursuit of their own priorities without the approval of Congress,” said Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee. “Attempts to do so undermines the principle of civilian control of the military and is in violation of the separation of powers within the Constitution.”"
2802,"Trump\xe2\x80\x99s plan to strip planes, ships, and vehicles from Pentagon budget to fund border wall draws bipartisan howls of protest from Congress'",Washington Examiner,2/14/2020,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/trumps-plan-to-strip-planes-ships-and-vehicles-from-pentagon-budget-to-fund-border-wall-draws-bipartisan-howls-of-protest-from-congress,"ASKING NEITHER FORGIVENESS NOR PERMISSION: In an audacious challenge to legislative branch’s power of the purse, the Trump administration has notified Congress it intends to take $3.8 billion from major weapons programs, warfighting funds, and the National Guard to pay for construction of hundreds of miles of additional border wall before the November election.
The reprogramming action sent to Capitol Hill yesterday cites the urgent need to deter drug smuggling across the southern border — not stopping illegal immigration — as an “unforeseen military requirement,” which it argues is “necessary in the national interest.”
BIPARTISAN OUTRAGE: The notification that the Pentagon was unilaterally eliminating planes, ships, vehicles and other equipment — that in many cases Congress had added to the president’s original FY 2020 budget — touched off an explosion of outrage, even among some Republicans who support funding for the border wall.
“Congress has the constitutional responsibility to determine how defense dollars are spent. We take the Pentagon’s recommendations seriously during our deliberations, but the final decisions are contained in the bills passed by Congress and signed into law. Once those choices have been made, the Department of Defense cannot change them in pursuit of their own priorities without the approval of Congress,” said Texas Republican Mac Thornberry, ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee. “The re-programming announced today is contrary to Congress’s constitutional authority.”
Committee Chairman Adam Smith accused President Trump of being “obsessed with fulfilling a campaign promise at the expense of our national security.”
“This Administration has already stolen billions from the Department of Defense in order to begin building the President’s vanity wall and today they are doubling down on bad policy,” Smith said in a statement. “The President loves to take credit for ‘rebuilding’ the military, but today’s reprogramming decision does the exact opposite – it will prevent the acquisition of critical ships, vehicles, and aircraft.”
“Rather than investing in the procurement of critical platforms, this administration would rather dump another $3.8 billion into a wall on our southern border,” Smith said. “It is clear to me, and anyone with experience in national security policy, that a wall on our southern border will do nothing to support our strategic advantage over Russia and China, support counterterrorism, address rogue states, or enhance relations with partners and allies.”
THE HIT LIST: Here are the cuts the Pentagon wants to make to come up with wall money, along with the military services and defense contractors who would be affected.
2 Marine Corps F-35B Lockheed Martin Joint Strike Fighters — $223 million
2 Marine Corps V-22 Boeing Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft — $155 million
4 Air Force C-130J Lockheed Martin Super Hercules Cargo planes — $365 million
8 Air Force MQ-9 General Atomics Reaper Drones — $160 million
1 Navy P-8A Boeing Poseidon maritime patrol planes — $180 million
1 Navy LHA-9 Huntington Ingalls Amphibious Assault ship — $650 million
1 Navy EPF Austal USA Expeditionary Fast Transport Ship — $261 million
Army AM General Humvees and other vehicles — $201 million
Funding for Air Force OA-X Light Attack Aircraft program — $180 million
Unspecified National Guard and Reserve equipment: — $1.3 billion
THE JUSTIFICATION: In most cases the Pentagon argued the axed weapons programs were in “excess” or “early” to “current programmatic need,” and were “a congressional special interest item.” Translation: the planes, ships, and vehicles are not needed, or at least not needed now, and in some cases were added by Congress to benefit districts with defense contractors or military bases.
The programing notification cites “general transfer authority” and “special transfer authority” in the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act as the legal basis for not needing approval from Congress to shift the funds into the Pentagon’s counterdrug account, where they can be used for wall construction.
Previously the Pentagon acted under the 1976 National Emergencies Act, which limits the transfer of funds to the total of funds that have been appropriated for military construction that have not been obligated.
GUARD STUNG: The cuts are a bitter pill for the Guard, which has been historically underfunded, says retired Brig. Gen. J. Roy Robinson, president of the National Guard Association of the U.S.
The Guard and Reserve took the biggest hit, $1.8 million dollars in weapons and equipment.
“While technically ‘congressional add-ons’ to the president's formal budget request, the funds were intended to purchase unfunded requirements and are the product of longstanding programs in the annual defense budget process,” said the association in response to the cuts.
""Any inference that these aren't critical needs for the Guard is false,"" Robinson said. ""This is just the Guard being used as a convenient bill-payer.""
The association outlined its concerns in a letter to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley.
WAR POWERS: Eight Republican senators joined Democrats in an effort to claw back from the executive branch the final say on waging war, providing the winning margin in a 55 to 45 vote to require President Trump seek congressional authorization before taking further military action against Iran.
The Republicans who supported the resolution drafted by Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine are Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Mike Lee of Utah, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Todd Young of Indiana.
""For me this debate is not about party. I have supported the Constitutional mandate that Congress must declare war under both Democrat and Republican Presidents and I will continue,” Paul tweeted. “For me this debate is not a dry and esoteric debate, it is a debate about life and death.”
“The president always has the ability to defend the United States against imminent attack. And we would not change that. The president needs that power. We're not tying the president's hands,” said Kaine on CNN. “We are just saying, war is the most serious thing that we do. It should only be done after serious deliberation. No one person should make the decision on their own.”
The measure fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a promised veto by President Trump.

HAPPENING TODAY: Everyone who is anyone in national security circles is in Germany today for the 56th annual Munich Security Conference, widely considered the world’s leading forum for international security policy. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are there, along with a bipartisan delegation of 21 members of Congress headed by Sen. Lindsay Graham, who took over the mantle from the late Sen. John McCain.
Mingling with the more than 500 heads of state, top diplomats, senior military officials from around the world, is the Washington Examiner’s own Joel Gehrke, who offers the following observations from Munich:
“The conference provides a high-profile forum for government decision-makers, former officials, and analysts to give speeches, participate in panel discussions, or even just rub elbows. Sometimes the elbows are quite sharp,” says Gehke, who is a veteran in covering the who’s who? of “the political West.”
“The Munich Security Conference is not merely think-tank nirvana. It’s a place for allies, partners, and adversaries gather to lay down public markers and hold private meetings about local hotspots and global foreign policy trends alike,” Gehrke says.
A FEELING OF ‘WESTLESSNESS’: if you haven’t heard the term before, you’ll hear it a lot this weekend. The idea that the world is becoming less Western, is the subject of a report that is a theme of this year’s conference.
“More importantly, the West itself may become less Western, too,” the report says. “The contemporary ‘spiritual disunity of the West’ is due to the rise of an illiberal and nationalist camp within the Western world.”
The report authors regard President Trump among those disintegrating forces, given his stated hostility to “globalists.” They continue to lament the United Kingdom’s “painful long goodbye” from the European Union. Brexit has altered the balance of power within the EU and French President Emmanuel Macron, some observers suspect, sees an opportunity to enhance the political influence of Paris while taking a half-step away from Washington.
THE US TAG TEAM: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo can be expected to dispute the idea that President Trump’s presence in the White House undermines transatlantic security in his Saturday morning speech “about the West and the West’s role in the world.” Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper are both likely to renew their warnings that Europe should beware of China’s ambitions for economic and political influence on the continent.
CEASEFIRE LIGHT: Before departing NATO headquarters in Brussels yesterday, Esper announced a week-long “sort-of” ceasefire that is hoped to be the first step on the long road to peace in Afghanistan.
“The United States and the Taliban have negotiated a proposal for a seven-day reduction in violence. I'm here today consulting with allies about this proposal and we've had a series of productive bilateral and collective meetings about the path forward,” Esper said, giving few details.
“We've said all along that the best, if not only, solution in Afghanistan is a political agreement,” he added. “Progress has been made on this front and we'll have more to report on that soon I hope.”
Asked if seven days were enough time to judge the sincerity of the Taliban’s pledge to reduce violence, Esper replied, “It is our view that seven days, for now, is sufficient,” but added, “Our approach to this process will be conditions-based ... So it will be a continual evaluative process, as we go forward, if we go forward.”
“We have the basis for one on the table. We are taking a hard look at it. We are consulting with our allies. We are consulting with Congress and others,” Esper said. “And I think peace deserves a chance. But it will demand that all parties comply with their obligations.”
POMPEO: ‘REAL PROGRESS’: Speaking to reporters on his plane en route to the Munich Security Conference, Pompeo insisted the agreement represented “real progress” in talks with the Taliban.
“We hope we can get to the place where we can get a significant reduction in violence – not only on a piece of paper, but demonstrated in the capability to actually deliver a serious reduction of violence in Afghanistan,” Pompeo. “And if we can get there and we can hold that posture for a while, we may well be able to begin the real serious discussion, which is all the Afghans sitting at a table, finding a true reconciliation path forward.”
CASUALTY COUNT: The Pentagon says another soldier has died in Afghanistan, this time from a non-combat incident, which usually means accident, suicide, or sometimes homicide.
The death Wednesday brings to five the number of U.S. troops who have lost their lives in Afghanistan this year. The soldier was identified as Spc. Branden Tyme Kimball, 21, from Central Point, Oregon, assigned to 3rd Battalion, 10th Aviation Regiment, 10th Combat Aviation Brigade, Fort Drum, New York.
Last year in Afghanistan 21 U.S. troops died, 19 in combat and two in what was described by the Pentagon as non-combat incidents, according to a count by the Washington Examiner.
So far this year five U.S. troops have died, four in combat. Two Green Berets were shot In Feb. 8 in a suspected insider attack, and two 82nd Airborne soldiers who were killed Jan. 11, when a roadside bomb struck their vehicle while on patrol.
INDUSTRY WATCH: HEY, HEY, YOU, YOU, GET OFF THAT CLOUD: A judge on the Court of Federal Claims has granted an injunction ordering a halt to work on the Pentagon’s cloud computing network as the court considers Amazon’s allegation that President Trump improperly influenced the bidding process for the network’s contract.
The Defense Department awarded the contract, valued at up to $10 billion, to Microsoft in October to build the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, network. Amazon is suing, seeking testimony from Trump and a handful of current and former top defense officials, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper, former Defense Secretary James Mattis.
""We are disappointed in today's ruling and believe the actions taken in this litigation have unnecessarily delayed implementing DoD's modernization strategy and deprived our warfighters of a set of capabilities they urgently need,” said Lt. Col, Robert Carver, a Pentagon spokesman. “However, we are confident in our award of the JEDI Cloud contract to Microsoft and remain focused on getting this critical capability into the hands of our warfighters as quickly and efficiently as possible.""
STARS AND STRIPES JUST DIDN’T MAKE THE CUT: In the end Secretary Esper’s attack on the fourth estate — which the Pentagon defines as the 50 DoD organizations and bureaucracy not directly related to warfighting — end up affecting the traditional fourth estate, journalism.
Esper defense wide review combed through $100 billion worth of programs looking for money that could be better spent elsewhere. Esper yesterday defended his decision to cut $7 million from Stars and Stripes, the Pentagon owned newspaper that has provided independent reporting to the troops since the Civil War.
“At the end of the day, that was not a priority that met the cut line,” Esper said. “And so we trimmed that support for Stars and Stripes because we need to invest that money, as we did with many, many, many other programs, into higher-priority issues.”

MUNICH, Germany (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Friday defended his decision to divert billions of dollars in funding for Navy and Air Force aircraft and other military programs to help pay for President Donald Trump’s promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.
Esper was asked by a reporter about criticism from Democrats and Republicans in Congress, including Rep. Mac Thornberry, a Republican from Texas, who called the diversion of funds contrary to the constitutional authority of Congress.
“Border security is national security,” Esper said, “and national security is our mission.”

He added, “The action we took is legal under the law, and so it should be no surprise, and I’ll just leave it at that for now.”
Esper spoke on the sidelines of an international security conference in Munich.
The Pentagon announced on Thursday that Esper approved shifting $3.8 billion in funds that Congress had previously authorized for F-35 fighter aircraft and other military programs. The money is being diverted to help the Department of Homeland Security build portions of the border wall. The Pentagon indicated that more such actions could be coming to provide additional funding for Trump’s signature campaign promise.
The action drew sharp rebukes from Democrats as well as Republicans.
“Today’s reprogramming request confirms once again that the President is obsessed with fulfilling a campaign promise at the expense of our national security,” Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. “This administration has already stolen billions from the Department of Defense in order to begin building the president’s vanity wall and today they are doubling down on bad policy.”
Last year, despite congressional opposition, Trump faced no consequences when making similar transfers by cancelling or postponing dozens of military construction projects to free up $3.6 billion .
In reaction to Thursday’s Pentagon announcement, Thornberry, the top Republican on the committee and a supporter of wall construction, said that while the administration’s constitutional role is to recommend how tax dollars are spent, final choices are made by Congress.
“Once those choices have been made, the Department of Defense cannot change them in pursuit of their own priorities without the approval of Congress,” he said. “Attempts to do so undermines the principle of civilian control of the military and is in violation of the separation of powers within the Constitution. The re-programming announced today is contrary to Congress’ constitutional authority, and I believe that it requires Congress to take action.”
Trump, while campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, repeatedly promised that Mexico would pay for the wall , but Mexico refused."
2346,US travel ban: Trump restricts immigration from Nigeria and five other countries',BBC News,2/1/2020,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51335011,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US issued more than 8,000 immigration visas to Nigerians in 2018
The US has announced it is expanding its curbs on immigration to include six more countries, including Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation.
Citizens from Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Kyrgyzstan and Myanmar will now be blocked from obtaining certain types of visas.
People from those countries will still be able to visit the US as tourists.
In 2018 the US issued twice as many immigration visas to Nigeria than to the other five nations combined.
An official said the new measures were the result of failures by the six countries to meet US security and information-sharing standards.
""These countries, for the most part, want to be helpful but for a variety of different reasons simply failed to meet those minimum requirements that we laid out,"" acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf told reporters on Friday.
He said officials would work with the countries on bolstering their security requirements to help them get off the list.
US President Donald Trump first introduced a travel ban in 2017. It currently closes US borders to citizens from seven countries, most of them with Muslim majorities.
In 2018 the US issued more than 8,000 immigration visas to citizens of Nigeria. That same year, just over 2,000 were issued to Sudanese nationals, 290 to Tanzanians, and just 31 to Eritreans.
The US had previously announced a ban on certain types of visas for Eritreans in 2017.
What are the new rules?
The US said it would suspend the issuance of visas that can lead to permanent residency for nationals of Nigeria, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, and Myanmar.
Sudanese and Tanzanian nationals will no longer be allowed to apply for ""diversity visas"", which are available by lottery for applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the US.
Mr Wolf said non-immigrant visas given to people for temporary stays - including visitors, those doing business or people seeking medical treatment - would not be impacted by the new rules.
Of the new nationalities facing visa restrictions, Nigerians account for the most immigration to the US.
According to US government statistics, the State Department issued 8,018 immigrant visas to Nigerians in the fiscal year 2018.
Kyrgyzstan and Sudan have large Muslim majorities, while around 50% of people in Nigeria and Eritrea are Muslim. Tanzania also has a sizable Muslim community.
What is the travel ban?
Mr Trump signed a controversial travel ban just seven days after taking office in January 2017, arguing it was vital to protect Americans.
The ban initially excluded people from seven majority-Muslim countries but the list was modified following a series of court challenges.
It now restricts citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Venezuela and North Korea.
While the government has suspended most immigrant and non-immigrant visas to applicants from those countries, exceptions are available for students and those with ""significant contacts"" in the US."
5910,Trump expands travel ban to six new countries',Washington Times,2/1/2020,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jan/31/trump-expands-travel-ban-six-new-countries/,"President Trump signed an order Friday expanding his travel ban to six new countries, targeting nations the government says pose a threat because they don’t issue electronic passports or don’t do enough to share information with American authorities to vet their citizens looking to travel.
The six countries are Burma, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania. They join seven countries who are still part of the president’s previous travel ban: Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.
“It is fundamental to national security, and the height of common sense, that if a foreign nation wishes to receive the benefits of immigration and travel to the United States, it must satisfy basic security conditions outlined by America’s law-enforcement and intelligence professionals,” said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.
The new countries aren’t subject to a total ban.
Only immigrant applications from Burma, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan and Nigeria will be blocked, while other travelers are not affected. For Sudan and Tanzania, only applicants under the diversity visa program will be blocked, a Homeland Security official said.
That means businesses can still bring in temporary workers and family members can still visit relatives here.
The official said the lower level of ban reflects the countries’ conditions.
“These six countries have a greater prospect of making improvements,” the official said.
The additional ban will take effect Feb. 22, so nobody traveling now will be affected, nor will those who already have visas. Anyone already in the U.S. is unaffected, too.
Based on past trends, Homeland Security said perhaps 12,000 people would be affected by the expanded ban.
Immigrant-rights groups complained that the expanded ban could harm vulnerable people.
“We are particularly concerned about Burmese refugees who may see America’s doors closed to them at a time of desperate need — including thousands of ethnic Chin, Karen, and Muslim Rohingya, who have fled severe persecution,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service
Government officials said refugees are not affected.
Mr. Trump issued his first travel ban Jan. 27, 2017, on seven majority-Muslim countries, virtually banning all entry of citizens from those countries.
That derided as a “Muslim ban,” and was halted by federal judges.
Mr. Trump would make two subsequent revisions to narrow the ban and alter the countries covered, deleting some of the original nations and adding in two non-Muslim nations, North Korea and Venezuela.
The Supreme Court in 2018 ruled that version of the ban was legal on its face — though it left room for challenges on how the ban was carried out. Those challenges are still making their way through lower courts.
Homeland Security officials defended the new additions to the list, saying they were added after an extensive review of every country’s vulnerabilities and willingness to share information with the U.S. so that their citizens looking to travel to the U.S. can be properly vetted.
“DHS and the Department of State have informed each of the six countries about their specific deficiencies,” a Homeland Security official said, adding that countries can earn their way off the list by improving their cooperation.
That happened in April 2018 when Chad made enough improvements to be dropped from the travel ban, the official said.

The move on Friday was slammed by immigrant advocates and critics who say the policy discriminates against Muslims and others.
More:
The announcement comes three years after Trump sparked outrage by signing an executive order suspending immigration from several Muslim-majority countries. That travel ban, which caused chaos and protests at airports, was challenged in the courts and eventually amended to target five Muslim-majority countries - Yemen, Syria, Iran, Libya and Somalia - as well put restrictions on nationals from Venezuela and North Korea.
The Trump administration maintains that the six additional countries - Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania - failed to meet US security and information-sharing standards, which necessitated the new restrictions. The problems officials cited ranged from subpar passport technology to a failure to sufficiently exchange information on ""terrorism"" suspects and criminals. The restrictions on the six new countries will take effect on February 21.
Here is a look at which countries are included in the expanded travel ban and what restrictions have been put in place.
Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar and Nigeria
The United States will suspend the issuance of visas that can lead to permanent residency for nationals of Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar and Nigeria, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf said on Friday.
Non-immigrant visas will not be affected. According to the State Department, non-immigrant visas include those for tourism, short-term business, medical purposes, education, and journalism, among other types of visas.
During December, for example, about 650,760 non-immigrant visas were granted worldwide.
Immigrant visas include those for spouses, certain family members, certain sponsored employment and other purposes.
The Trump administration said there are exceptions to the restrictions.
Sudan and Tanzania
The US government will also stop issuing ""diversity visas"" to nationals of Sudan and Tanzania, according to a presidential proclamation.
These visas - which Trump has criticised in the past - are available by lottery for applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the US.
The State Department uses a computer drawing to select people from around the world for up to 55,000 diversity visas. Nigeria is already excluded from the lottery along with other countries that had more than 50,000 natives immigrate to the US in the previous five years.

Yemen, Syria, Iran, Somalia and Libya
The existing version of the ban includes the Muslim-majority nations of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. North Korea and Venezuela also face visa restrictions, but those measures affect relatively few travellers.
The current ban suspends immigrant and non-immigrant visas to applicants from the affected countries, but it allows exceptions, including for students and those who have established ""significant contacts"" in the US.
These restrictions will remain in place, the proclamation said.
North Korea and Venezuela
Most North Koreans are barred from entering the US.
The Venezuelan ban mostly affects government officials and their family members."
5969,A Barrier to Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Border Wall: Landowners in Texas',New York Times (Online News),12/26/2019,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/26/us/politics/trump-border-wall.html,"“They’re going to acquire the land for their wall, whether you negotiate with them upfront or they end up filing a lawsuit and taking it by a declaration of taking,” said Roy Brandys, a lawyer specializing in eminent domain who represented Mr. Drawe.
Adding to the heartache is where the wall is actually going. The construction is not on the border, which runs along the Rio Grande. It is well within the American side.
Mr. Drawe will lose easy access to the land between the wall and the river — about 350 of his 525 acres. The government has agreed to pay him about $42,000 for the 12 acres that the wall will be built on and about $197,000 to compensate for depressing the value of his farm, Mr. Drawe said. Gates are supposed to provide access to his property south of the wall.
By Mr. Drawe’s reckoning, that might be of limited value. He has found packages of drugs on his farm before, he said, and is concerned that the cartel members that Mr. Trump cites as the reason for the construction will take control of all the land south of the wall.
“If the wall goes up,” Mr. Drawe said, “it will be the new border.”
Becky Jones is preparing for a fight. The Trump administration recently sent Ms. Jones, 69, and her family a letter saying that it was preparing to take them to court if they did not allow the government to survey their farmland for border wall construction.
For Ms. Jones, the construction undercuts language in Congress’s 2019 spending bill that said land within the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge adjacent to her property would be exempt from the wall. She said the construction, which will run on the road alongside the refuge, will harm the wildlife she grew up admiring."

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf visited a construction site in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas on a windswept day last month and repeated a Trump administration pledge.
""We are on track to build 450 to 500 miles of new wall by the end of 2020,"" he told reporters. Behind him, steel panels atop a concrete levee wall, 30 feet in all, are rising from the sugar cane fields and bird sanctuaries of the valley — which is really a river delta. They are the first section of new border wall built under President Trump where there was no barrier before.
But that swaggering Washington confidence is not shared down on the border. Asked about Trump's Election Day deadline, Carmen Qualia, an assistant chief with the Border Patrol, acknowledged it's slow going.
""[Trump] said, 'Hey, here's my deadline, here's what I need you to do.' So we're gonna continue to work towards meeting that deadline,"" said Qualia, who is in charge of the Rio Grande Valley wall team. ""And we're either going to make it or not.""
Trump gets an additional $1.4 billion toward his massive wall along the 2,000-mile southwest border under a government spending bill he is expected to sign. But in Texas, there's widespread skepticism the president will have anywhere near the 450 miles of wall he wants by next December. Construction has already fallen behind schedule because of how difficult it is to take private land.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Cedar Attanasio/AP Cedar Attanasio/AP
One contract reviewed by NPR, called RGV10, says construction isn't expected to begin on certain wall segments until March 2021 — well after the election.
""If you don't have 12 months to acquire property, you're cutting it way too short,"" said Hyla Head, a former real estate specialist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers who spearheaded land acquisition for the first phase of wall-building under President George W. Bush in 2008.
Customs and Border Protection, which is part of Homeland Security, doesn't yet own most of the land where it plans to build the wall. In fact, Wolf's photo op was staged on a half-mile section of the levee that was only recently acquired by the federal government. Hidalgo County land records show that much of the property needed to complete that stretch of wall is still in private hands.
Disorderly property records, complications with landowners and a cumbersome condemnation process have slowed progress to a snail's pace. That's despite an army of federal land specialists trying to rush the process to please the president.
Consider this: The government plans to erect 110 miles of the total 450 miles of barriers in the Rio Grande Valley. But as of last week, the feds still needed to acquire about 90 miles from private landowners. In fact, since January 2017 the administration has only taken three miles from private owners in the Rio Grande Valley, according to a CBP spokesperson.
""It's a big project,"" Qualia said. ""We're gonna continue to do what we can to make it happen.""
But she says agents want the tall wall, along with floodlights, sensors, cameras and a 150-foot-wide enforcement zone to combat drug and human trafficking.
""We've been asking for these tools, this technology ... the roads,"" Qualia said. ""And if it takes longer, it takes longer.""
Most of the borderlands in Texas are privately owned, unlike states to the west where a strip along the border is mostly federal property.

""Every project that has real estate acquisition is prevented from making faster progress,"" said a senior manager with detailed knowledge of wall building in the Rio Grande Valley who is not authorized to speak publicly.
Under eminent domain, the government can take private property for public use, but it has to pay for it. And that process is laborious and legalistic.
""Federal entities that acquire property have a process,"" said Head. ""You may not like it, but this is tried and true. We have laws to protect property owners.""
Roy Brandys, an eminent domain lawyer in Austin, Texas, has long experience representing border clients. Asked about completing the border wall in the valley by next December, he said, ""That would be a very aggressive schedule, very difficult to get accomplished just because of all the different issues that properties have.""
Each step of the process is proving problematic. First, the government has to identify and make contact with each property owner.
In Starr County, at the western end of the Rio Grande Valley, the government is planning 52 miles of border wall. Ultimately, the administration will need to acquire acreage on hundreds of individual parcels. So far, the wall contractor has broken ground only in one unit owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
""It's very difficult to know who the rightful owners are. That's the biggest challenge,"" said Rosalva Guerra, the chief appraiser of Starr County, where property records are notoriously incomplete.
Enlarge this image toggle caption John Burnett/NPR John Burnett/NPR
In her tidy office, she pulls up a map on her computer screen that shows all the properties in the county. The map is awash with red, the color used to denote parcels where the county is unsure of the owner.
In Starr County, property has been handed down through many generations, some of it going back to land grants made by the King of Spain. Tracts are divided and subdivided between heirs, but Guerra says they rarely establish clear title.
""So can you imagine the long list of heirs to partition that?"" Guerra said. ""It's a nightmare. Yeah, it's just going to take a long time to be able to do that. I don't think it's going to happen by 2020.""
Yet a senior CBP official in Washington was not so pessimistic about the construction timetable. ""If [landowners] don't voluntarily sell and we have to condemn the property,"" the official said, ""the judge can grant possession to the government nearly immediately after the declaration of taking and we can begin construction. ... We're getting a lot of offers to sell down there.""
Enlarge this image toggle caption Verónica G. Cárdenas for NPR Verónica G. Cárdenas for NPR
Identifying the owner is only the first step. Then the government must request access to survey the land. So far, the Justice Department has had to sue nearly 50 property owners in the Rio Grande Valley just to get that access.
One of those defendants is Delfino Garza, an architect in Starr County. He didn't want government surveyors coming on his property outside Rio Grande City where he has a vineyard. As a sideline, he planted grapes a decade ago, clearing thick brush down by the Rio Grande for his vine rows.
""After about the third year, we started to make wine. And now in the last year they came to us about putting a border wall on our property,"" Garza said.
Garza is fighting the border wall. He voted for Trump, but he says he won't do so a second time. He fears the wall will kill his infant winemaking business.
""People don't go to wineries to see a border wall,"" he said. ""We want this to be an attraction for the city. And this is just hurting us.""
Qualia, the Border Patrol official in charge of the Rio Grande Valley wall team, says the government is trying not to be heavy-handed. Land acquistion specialists are spending time talking to landowners like Garza about the placement of the barrier on his vineyard property.
""I think it's important to note that we all live here, too,"" Qualia said. ""Our kids go to school. We go to church. So we really take that into consideration when we're sitting down and meeting with these owners.""
And, inevitably, those discussions with landowners will delay the project further. ""Things that are complicated typically do take time,"" Qualia added.
Meanwhile, Trump has appointed his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner to oversee and speed up completion of the border wall. The president has asked for frequent updates. He reportedly told aides earlier this year, just ""take the land.""
But in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, it's not that easy.

The Trump administration’s chief border enforcement official cast doubt on the administration’s goal of completing construction of the southern border wall by 2021, throwing cold water on one of the Trump campaign’s major promises heading into next year’s election.
“It’s hard right now to say whether we’re still going to meet that goal,” Customs and Border Protection acting commissioner Mark Morgan said in an interview with The New York Times published Wednesday. “But I’m confident we’re going to be close.”

President Trump has promised to install 450 miles of new border wall by 2021.
In September, Defense Secretary Mark Esper approved the transfer of $3.6 billion from military construction projects to build 175 miles of border wall, a move that comes several months after Trump declared a national emergency regarding the situation at the border, where thousands of migrants have crossed into the U.S. illegally this year.
Until this month, the administration had focused on rebuilding existing barriers and fences at the border, resulting in 93 miles of new wall, most of which was built on federal land where border barriers previously existed. On December 5, construction began in Donna, Texas for the first new eight-mile section of border wall.

In Texas, the administration is also reportedly hoping to exercise eminent domain laws against private landowners along the border to expedite wall construction on their land.

Border authorities have continued to tighten immigration laws over the past year after the flow of undocumented immigrants surged at the U.S.-Mexico border during the spring. In September, the Department of Homeland Security announced that the vast majority of migrant families who enter the country illegally will no longer be eligible for so-called “catch and release” due to the implementation of the “Migrant Protection Protocols,” which require that migrants wait in Mexico while their asylum claims are being adjudicated.

5161,New Jersey just became the 15th state to pass a bill letting unauthorized immigrants obtain driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses',Vox,12/20/2019,,,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/18/21028348/new-jersey-unauthorized-undocumented-illegal-immigrant-drivers-license-law-murphy-ice-dhs,"New Jersey has joined 14 other states in passing a law allowing unauthorized immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses — meaning that nearly half of the estimated 10.6 million unauthorized immigrants currently in the US now live in states with such laws.
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, is expected to sign the bill passed by the New Jersey Legislature on Monday night. The legislation would create two forms of driver’s licenses: a federally compliant Real ID license that let people board planes, and a “standard” driver’s license for driving and identification, for which unauthorized immigrants could use foreign passports or driver’s licenses to apply rather than a Social Security number. If signed, the bill would go into effect in January 2021.
The states of California, Connecticut, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Washington, Illinois, Vermont, Maryland, Delaware, Hawaii, Oregon, and New York, as well as Puerto Rico and Washington, DC, already offer driver’s licenses to unauthorized immigrants — meaning that roughly 5.3 million unauthorized immigrants nationwide would be eligible to get one, according to 2017 estimates.
Immigrant advocates continue to lobby other states to pass similar laws, including Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Texas, and Massachusetts, which first proposed such legislation 15 years ago.
Research suggests that making driver’s licenses available to unauthorized immigrants improves safety. Obtaining a license requires testing and training on road safety, as well as proof that an applicant can get auto insurance. Drivers with licenses are also more willing to cooperate with law enforcement, reducing burdens on police forces.
A 2016 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal found that after California implemented its driver’s license law in 2015, hit-and-runs dropped between 7 percent and 10 percent on average — amounting to roughly 4,000 fewer such accidents annually.
Such policies also have financial benefits, both for local governments and for drivers. The Fiscal Policy Institute found in 2017 that state and county governments could collect about $57 million in annual revenue, as well as $26 million in one-time revenues, by issuing 150,000 driver’s licenses to unauthorized immigrants in New York City. The researchers also determined that it would likely lower auto insurance premiums overall.
An analysis conducted by New York City also found that having a driver’s licenses provides additional financial stability for families and increases employment opportunities for unauthorized immigrants. Having a car allows them to look for jobs and housing that are not located near public transportation.
It also helps to shield them from deportation. If a police officer pulls over an authorized immigrant driving without a license, they could be referred to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and sent to removal proceedings.
But even unauthorized immigrants with driver’s licenses might still be at risk for deportation. A lawsuit filed in January claimed that the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles had unlawfully targeted unauthorized immigrants by sending their names, photos, car registrations, and other personal information to ICE.
The Trump administration has pushed back against efforts to prevent ICE from accessing DMV data. As New York’s driver’s license law went into effect Monday, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that those records allow it to investigate crimes such as human trafficking by “building criminal cases, identifying criminal suspects, and enhancing officer safety.”"
4608,"New York law lets undocumented immigrants apply for driver's licenses, blocks ICE access""",USA TODAY,12/20/2019,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/19/new-york-drivers-licenses-open-undocumented-immigrants-green-light-law/2696451001/,"ALBANY, N.Y. – Federal immigration and border officials have been blocked from New York's DMV database, a move that keeps them from accessing data that can be used to help determine whether a vehicle owner has a criminal history or a warrant for their arrest.
New York's Green Light Law took effect Saturday, allowing those without legal immigration status to apply for driver's licenses in New York.
But the law also included a provision prohibiting state DMV officials from providing any of its data to entities that enforce immigration law unless a judge orders them to, leading the state to cut off database access to at least three federal agencies last week.
Among them were U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP — which patrols the U.S.-Canada border in New York — and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.
Federal officials appeared caught off guard by the change last week, which was laid out in the state law approved in June.
The information federal officers can access from the database is important to keep them and the public safe, said Mark Morgan, CBP's acting commissioner.
“New York’s Green Light Law is detrimental to CBP and ICE,"" Morgan said in a statement Tuesday.
""The information we receive from New York state is vital to our missions, and blocking federal law enforcement officers from accessing it creates a significant threat to both officer and public safety.”
The data is ""vital to building out these criminal cases, identifying criminal suspects, and enhancing officer safety,"" according to the Department of Homeland Security.
Border crisis:One deadly week reveals where the immigration crisis begins — and where it ends
Database serves as law-enforcement tool
The DMV database allows officers to quickly access information about a vehicle registration holder, including their traffic history. The data can then be used to determine whether a driver is on a sex-offender registry or has a criminal history and whether they have outstanding warrants.
Officers often run license plates through the database during traffic stops and similar encounters.
New York's Democratic-led Legislature and Gov. Andrew Cuomo approved the Green Light Law in June, allowing immigrants living in the country without legal permission to use foreign-issued documents to prove their age and identity so they can apply for driving privileges.
The law reversed the state's post-9/11 policy of denying driving privileges to immigrants without legal immigration status.
State lawmakers inserted the data-blocking provision into the bill a week before it passed, when immigrant organizations and Cuomo expressed concern that ICE and CBP would be able to easily obtain information about immigrants seeking a license, perhaps making it easier for them to be deported.
Specifically, the provision says DMV ""shall not disclose"" any records or information to ""any agency that primarily enforces immigration law.""
The only exceptions are if the DMV commissioner is served with ""a lawful court order or judicial warrant,"" according to the law.
Even then, the DMV has to notify the person at the center of a federal agency's inquiry within three days.
DMV spokeswoman Lisa Koumjian said the state agency is bound by the law. No negotiations are underway to restore the federal agencies' access to the database, she said.
""Under the Green Light Law, no DMV data of any kind can be shared with an agency that primarily enforces immigration law, which means ICE, Customs and Border Protection and Citizenship and Immigration Services do not have access to data unless the DMV is presented with a valid judge-signed court order, subpoena or judicial warrant,"" Koumjian said in a statement.
Report:US to send asylum seekers to Honduras, blocking them from making a claim in America
Trump's DOJ calls provision 'legally suspect'
Anu Joshi, the New York Immigration Coalition's senior director of immigration policy, said supporters of the Green Light Law are proud it has ""some of the strongest privacy protections of any such law in the country.""
At least a dozen other states allow undocumented immigrants to apply for driving privileges.
""We should be clear that this law doesn't just protect the data of undocumented immigrants; it protects the data of all New Yorkers who are applying for a standard license,"" Joshi said Tuesday. ""It treats all New Yorkers who are applying for a standard license the same.""
President Donald Trump's Department of Justice weighed in earlier this month, intervening in Rensselaer County Clerk Frank Merola's lawsuit that sought to block the Green Light Law from taking effect.
Trump, a Republican, has made tough immigration policies a central piece of his presidency.
The DOJ only weighed in on the data-blocking provision, calling it ""legally suspect"" and questioning whether it violates federal law.
But U.S. District Judge Gary Sharpe later dismissed Merola's lawsuit entirely without considering the DOJ questions, deciding Merola didn't have the legal capacity to sue.
U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., wrote a letter Friday to Cuomo, a Democrat, urging him to restore the federal agencies' access to the DMV information.
She questioned whether citizens with enhanced driver's licenses — which allow the license holder to cross the Canadian border — would be able to re-enter the U.S. if Customs agents don't have access to the database.
A CBP spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether that's the case.
""Hamstringing (Border Patrol agents') ability to effectively execute their jobs is a huge mistake and I urge you to consider the safety of all Americans by immediately reversing this decision,"" Stefanik wrote.

""Expanding access to driver's licenses is critical for the safety of New Jerseyans and a step toward building a stronger and fairer New Jersey for all,"" Murphy said.
Murphy, a Democrat, signed the bill after it was approved by the Democratic majorities in both the state Assembly and Senate, during their final legislative sessions of the year.
“The legislation advanced on the Assembly floor and by the Senate today is fair and responsible,” Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, a Democrat, told The Wall Street Journal. “It brings us one step closer to ensuring all motor vehicles and drivers are insured, thereby creating safer roadways for all New Jersey residents.”

The legislation allows illegal immigrants over age 16 to obtain driver's licenses and learner's permits. Applicants can use foreign documents such as passports or their old driver's license from their home country to complete the process. A Social Security number is not required, according to The Associated Press.
The law reportedly establishes two types of licenses. One would conform to federal REAL ID requirements and would require proof of legal residency. The second license would only require six points of identification. The applicant would not have to provide proof of U.S. citizenship.

4243,Pentagon watchdog plans to review award of $400M border wall contract to firm touted by Trump',NBC News (Online),12/12/2019,,,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/pentagon-watchdog-plans-review-award-400m-border-wall-contract-firm-n1099911,"WASHINGTON — The Defense Department's internal watchdog plans to review a recent Army Corps of Engineers decision to award a $400 million contract for border wall construction to a North Dakota company that has been publicly and privately endorsed by members of the Trump administration, including the president himself.
The review of the award to Fisher Sand & Gravel is an audit by the Pentagon's inspector general and comes in response to a request by Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the Democratic chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security. Thompson said the decision to award the contract should be reviewed because Fisher's ""proposals reportedly did not meet the operational requirements of U.S. Customs and Border Protection"" and because of ""concerns about the possibility of inappropriate influence"" on the Army Corps of Engineers.
""This is in response to your December 4, 2019, letter requesting that the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General conduct a review of the $400 million contract the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers awarded to Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. to design and build border infrastructure in Yuma County, Arizona,"" wrote Glenn Fine, the principal deputy inspector general, according to a copy of the inspector general's response to Thompson obtained by NBC News. “In your letter, you raised concerns about the possibility of inappropriate influence on USACE's contracting decision, and questioned whether the bid submitted by Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. met solicitation standards. You also questioned whether USACE made the award in accordance with federal procurement law and regulations.""
""In response to your request, we have decided to initiate an audit of the solicitation and award of this contract,"" Fine wrote. ""We are assessing the methodology of that audit and will formally announce the audit soon.""
Thompson said Thursday he was pleased the inspector general ""recognized the urgency of our request. ... The company had never been awarded a construction contract before and their wall prototype was late and over budget.""
""Given the president's multiple endorsements of this company and the amount of taxpayer money at stake, I remain concerned about the possibility of inappropriate influence,"" Thompson said.

For years and in recent meetings, the president has pushed the Army Corps of Engineers to consider awarding a contract for border wall construction to Fisher, according to three sources familiar with the discussions. And in a trip to the border in November, Trump's new acting secretary of homeland security and the chief of the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector toured a privately funded wall built by Fisher.
The renewed push for Fisher by Trump and DHS officials caught many by surprise, given the controversy in which the company has been entangled. The Washington Post first reported Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., held up the confirmation of a White House official in his demands to see border wall contracts that had gone out to other companies.

Officials feared Cramer was attempting to share proprietary information with Fisher so that they could make their bid more competitive. Cramer was a proponent of Fisher, a company from his home state, and had repeatedly made outreach on their behalf to the White House.
According to two U.S. officials, on a visit to the border early this year, Trump said he wanted the border wall to be two things: Cheap and good-looking. And Fisher had promised just that with its proposal of a concrete barrier for one-third of the cost of other bidders.
Fisher was officially awarded the contract Dec. 2. The details of its winning design are not known.
In a statement on Thursday, a Fisher spokesperson said, ""Fisher is committed to full cooperation with any inquiry or audit. Fisher was one of 3 bidders on the Army Corps contract and Fisher was chosen for award based on the merits of its proposal as the Lowest Priced, Technically Acceptable offeror.""
Border agents have repeatedly said they want the ability to see through any barrier built along the border, and the concrete design Fisher originally proposed would not give them that ability. There was also doubt that Fisher has the ability to carry through the project, especially at the low cost it has estimated.
In the spring of 2018, when Trump first began telling his advisers he wanted Fisher to be awarded a contract, officials at DHS pushed back, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.
""We had to explain the rules of federal procurement. You can't just pick a winner,"" said a person familiar with the conversations about Fisher with Trump in 2018. ""He thought he could get three times the amount of wall because they were offering it for one-third of the price. But we were dubious.""
Eventually, Trump was assuaged by Army Corps of Engineers officials who told him they would be sure Fisher was at least considered in the bidding process. Prior to the new contract, none of the contracts awarded for new or replacement wall had been given to Fisher. Recently, however, Fisher's name is back on the president's tongue and many of his allies, including his newly named acting DHS secretary.
Last month, Chad Wolf toured a 3.5-mile wall under construction by Fisher on private land near El Paso, Texas. The construction of the ""water wall,"" which runs adjacent to the Rio Grande, was funded by crowd-sourcing through a group called ""We Build the Wall.""
Gloria Chavez, chief of the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector, said that after We Build the Wall began building its barrier, ""Everything changed for us, and we were able to manage the border enforcement actions there even better.""
We Build the Wall is led by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state whose views had been considered too extreme to head Trump's Department of Homeland Security. Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner has also been a proponent of Fisher's and We Build the Wall in internal meetings, according to a former DHS official, a congressional aide and a U.S. official."

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Defense Department’s internal watchdog is investigating a $400 million border wall contract awarded to a firm that used multiple appearances on Fox News to push for the job.
The Pentagon’s inspector general sent a letter Thursday to House Homeland Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson telling him the contract awarded to North Dakota-based firm Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. would be audited. Thompson, D-Miss., asked for the review last week, in part over concerns the proposals did not meet operational requirements and prototypes came in late and over budget.

Tommy Fisher, the head of the family business, said Thursday there would be “nothing to find” in an audit.
“We were told we were the lowest price and the best value,” he said. “We look forward to working with the Army Corps of Engineers.”
The border wall is one of Trump’s top priorities . He campaigned on a promise to build a “big beautiful wall” between the U.S. and Mexico,” said Mexico would pay for it, and promised to build 450 to 500 miles by the end of 2020. Mexico is not paying for the wall and, as of Nov. 1, Trump had built 78 miles.
Trump’s effort to push through funding, using money from the Pentagon after Congress refused to fund the wall has been met with resistance and lawsuits. A federal judge this week blocked the administration from spending some Defense Department money on the the barrier — the money includes the contract for Fisher.
The company was awarded a contract Dec. 2 to build 31 miles of wall in Arizona, part of a series of contracts to push out increased mileage. Fisher had made a number of appearances on Trump’s favorite cable news channel — Fox News — talking about his desire to win a contract. His firm, though, has little experience with such construction and a previous proposal was rejected.
Fisher said his company could do the work for $13 million a mile. He said the next closest bid was $20 million a mile.
A letter from the Army Corps when Fisher was awarded the contract said the company’s proposal was both technically acceptable, and the best priced.
Two administration officials familiar with the matter told The Associated Press this year that Trump aggressively pushed the Fisher firm’s bid with the heads of Homeland Security and the Army Corps of Engineers, which manages wall contracts. The interference in federal contracting by a president concerned some overseeing the process but, the officials said, Trump insisted Fisher could get the wall up faster and cheaper than other bidders. The officials weren’t authorized to speak about internal discussions and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

Thompson had said one of his concerns was that officials from Homeland Security, the department managing border security, had toured a private barrier built by the company shortly before the contract was awarded.
The Pentagon watchdog said it was assessing how to complete the audit and would formally announce it soon.
Thompson said he was pleased.
“The company had never been awarded a construction contract before and their wall prototype was late and over budget,” he said in a statement. “Given the President’s multiple endorsements of this company and the amount of taxpayer money at stake, I remain concerned about the possibility of inappropriate influence on the Army Corps’ contracting decision.”
The award was the second-largest contract in the company’s history. Previously, Fisher built highways, sold heavy equipment and did excavation work. The company unsuccessfully sued the government in April when it was not awarded a similar contract.

Following a request from Democratic lawmakers, the Pentagon’s watchdog will audit a recent Army Corps of Engineers decision to award a $400 million border-wall contract to a North Dakota company that was repeatedly praised by President Trump.
According to NBC News, which reviewed a copy of the letter sent from the Department of Defense (DoD) inspector general to the House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.), the audit has been initiated and will be formally announced soon.

Thompson sent a letter to the DoD on December 4 requesting an audit over “concerns about the possibility of inappropriate influence.” On December 2, the DoD announced that North-Dakota-based firm Fisher Sand and Gravel won the $400 million contract to build a 31-mile wall in Arizona’s Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge over the next year.
In a statement to National Review following the decision, the company said it looked forward “to the opportunity to work with the Army Corps of Engineers on this important project.”
“We are excited to show our high quality work . . . while helping to secure our southern border,” Fisher Industries’ statement read.

Company chief executive Tommy Fisher is a GOP donor and has claimed during appearances on Fox News that the company can build the border wall faster than the Army Corps of Engineers.

Trump has reportedly pushed since May for the Defense Department to accept Fisher’s bid, and allegedly brought up the company in several conversations with Department of Homeland Security officials as well as Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, commanding general of the Army Corps of Engineers.
Thompson said Thursday he was pleased with the decision to audit the contract.
“Given the president’s multiple endorsements of this company and the amount of taxpayer money at stake, I remain concerned about the possibility of inappropriate influence,” he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s boast of building part of the border wall in Colorado is garnering attention in the state, including from the state’s governor, Democrat Jared Polis.
Trump was speaking Wednesday to an audience in Pennsylvania when he included Colorado in a list of states where the border wall is being constructed, along with New Mexico and Texas.
The president said: “We’re building a wall in Colorado, we’re building a beautiful wall, a big one that really works, that you can’t get over, you can’t get under.”
Of course, Colorado doesn’t share a border with Mexico, which Polis, and others on social media noted.

Polis tweeted: “Well this is awkward ...Colorado doesn’t border Mexico. Good thing Colorado now offers free full day kindergarten so our kids can learn basic geography.”
Early Thursday, Trump tweeted that he made the comment about Colorado and the wall “kiddingly” and said people in Colorado would benefit from the wall on the border."

3035,Trump administration to restrict visas for uninsured applicants',Fox News (Online),10/5/2019,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-to-require-immigrants-to-prove-they-can-afford-health-insurance,"President Trump issued a proclamation Friday requiring immigrants applying for U.S. visas to prove they can afford health care.
Applicants will be denied entry into the U.S. unless they have plans to be covered by health insurance within 30 days of entering or have enough financial resources to cover the cost, according to the White House.
The measure would take effect Nov. 3 and will apply to applicants for visas from abroad. It will not be applied retroactively to those already in the U.S. It does not affect lawful permanent residents, nor does it apply to asylum seekers, refugees or children. However, it would apply to the spouses and parents of U.S. citizens.
“Hospitals and other providers often administer care to the uninsured without any hope of receiving reimbursement from them,” the White House explained. “The costs associated with this care are passed on to the American people in the form of higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher fees for medical services ... The United States has a long history of welcoming immigrants who come lawfully in search of brighter futures. We must continue that tradition while also addressing the challenges facing our healthcare system, including protecting both it and the American taxpayer from the burdens of uncompensated care.""
TOP WARREN CAMPAIGN OFFICIAL FIRED FOR 'INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR'
Hospitals have spent more than $35 billion, or an average of $7 million per hospital, on “unreimbursed services” over the last 10 years, according to the White House.
“Beyond imposing higher costs on hospitals and other healthcare infrastructure, uninsured individuals often use emergency rooms to seek remedies for a variety of non-emergency conditions, causing overcrowding and delays for those who truly need emergency services,” the White House added.
Under the proposed rule, the required insurance can be purchased individually or provided by an employer, and it can be short-term coverage or catastrophic. Medicaid doesn't count. And an immigrant will not be able to obtain a visa if using ObamaCare subsidies when buying insurance.
BERNIE SANDERS RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL, DOCTORS SAY HE SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK
According to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan immigration think tank, 57 percent of U.S. immigrants had private health insurance in 2017, compared with 69 percent of U.S.-born, and 30 percent had public health insurance coverage, compared with 36 percent of native-born. The institute also said the uninsured rate for immigrants dropped from 32 percent to 20 percent between 2013 to 2017.
Earlier this year the Trump administration issued a “public charge rule,” which will go into effect Oct. 15, allowing federal officials to deny green cards to applicants deemed likely to rely on government aid. Officials described the rule as a means to protect taxpayers and promote self-sufficiency among those granted permanent residence. Factors to be considered under the “public charge rule” are age, health, financial assets and education.
The White House also directed officials to recover income-based welfare payments from sponsors and proposed a rule requiring verification of immigration status for anyone seeking access to public housing benefits.

The new restrictions came as immigration and health care are at the forefront of the 2020 presidential race. Democratic candidates have repeatedly decried Trump’s strict immigration policies and most have touted ""Medicare-for-All"" or at the very least a public option for health care. Most have even taken it a step further and supported providing health care for undocumented immigrants. Trump mocked Democrats on Twitter who supported the idea at a Democratic primary debate in June.
“All Democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare,” Trump tweeted. “How about taking care of American Citizens first!? That’s the end of that race!”

3485,Trump Will Deny Immigrant Visas to Those Who Can\xe2\x80\x99t Pay for Health Care',New York Times (Online News),10/5/2019,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/us/immigrant-visas-health-care.html,"The surprise order is the latest step in a long effort by Stephen Miller, the president’s top immigration adviser, and others in the administration, to limit what they consider the financial burdens of allowing immigrants into the United States.
After years of effort by Mr. Miller, the administration issued a regulation in August that would allow officials to deny permanent legal status to immigrants who are poor. The regulation, which imposes an aggressive wealth test on legal immigrants, has faced several legal challenges but will go into effect on Oct. 15 unless it is blocked by a court.
That policy, known as the “public charge” rule, says immigrants seeking to live permanently in the United States could be denied if officials deem it is likely they will be a burden on society by, for example, being unable to pay for health care or seeking food and housing assistance.
Under the new proclamation, which was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal, officials are directed to use a similar approach in determining whether to grant immigrant visas to people seeking to live in the United States.
Immigration advocates were taken aback by the proclamation, noting there are already several steps that applicants for a green card must take to qualify, including passing background checks and health examinations.
Elizabeth Jamae, an immigration lawyer at Pearl Law Group in San Francisco, said she doubted the assertion in the proclamation that lawful immigrants were about three times as likely as United States citizens to lack health insurance.
“Most people who are receiving green cards already have a job waiting or have a spouse that is employed,” Ms. Jamae said. “When you apply for a green card you already have to meet certain financial requirements.”"

The Trump administration said it won’t admit immigrants who can’t cover their own medical costs, a policy criticized as likely to lead to separations for some families and that could quickly face legal challenges.
Would-be immigrants will need to show they’ll be covered by health insurance within 30 days of entering the U.S. or have the financial resources to pay their medical bills, or be denied visas, President Donald Trump said in a proclamation issued late Friday.
The move aims to reject those “who will financially burden the United States health care system,” according to the proclamation.
The measure, set to take effect Nov. 3, highlights Trump’s tough stance on immigrants that was central to his 2016 campaign, and remains prominent heading into the 2020 election. It also comes as the president is under pressure from a fast-moving impeachment inquiry.
It follows a move in August aimed at weeding out immigrants deemed likely to access various forms of taxpayer-funded assistance, such as food stamps or subsidized housing.
Trump Takes Aim at Legal Immigration With Reviews on Public Aid
“Donald Trump is panicking, and using cruel attacks on immigrants to distract and sow fear,” Julian Castro, a Democratic candidate for president and a former Obama administration cabinet member, said on Twitter.
The move effectively creates a mandate for immigrants to have health care insurance, after the administration overturned the Obama-era rule for all Americans to have coverage, which was a setback for efforts to reduce the level of uninsured in the U.S.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, tweeted that the move was “hypocrisy, xenophobia, and barbarism.”
In the proclamation, Trump said costs of services provided by hospitals that don’t get reimbursed has topped $35 billion each year in the past decade, and immigrants are about three times more likely to lack health insurance then U.S. citizens.
“While our health care system grapples with the challenges caused by uncompensated care, the United States Government is making the problem worse by admitting thousands of aliens who have not demonstrated any ability to pay for their health care costs,” Trump said.
Catch-22 Created
Other lawmakers objected.
“President Trump is shamelessly targeting & punishing low-income immigrants & families,” the 38-member Congressional Hispanic Caucus said a tweet. “Trump’s order will separate U.S. citizens from their legal immigrant spouses & loved ones. Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda has no bounds & is hurting American families.”
The policy creates a Catch-22 for some families, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Lawful immigrants qualify for health care subsidies, but “subsidized coverage does not qualify as insurance under the proclamation,” Levitt said in a tweet.
“Health insurance is hard enough for immigrants to access in this country; it’s hard enough for citizens too,” the immigrant rights group United We Dream said on Twitter.

Wednesday’s “safe third country”-type deal is similar to agreements signed by El Salvador on Sept. 20 and Guatemala on July 26. The countries have released few details about how the agreements would be implemented.
(For a link to the El Salvador deal, please click on: tmsnrt.rs/2ldjzJI. For a link to Guatemala deal, click on: tmsnrt.rs/2niarEz)
The Honduras deal “will allow migrants to seek protection as close to home as possible,” said a senior U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official who told reporters about the deal in a conference call on condition of anonymity.The official did not say why he did not want to be named.
The Trump administration is moving forward with a July 16 rule that would bar most migrants from gaining U.S. asylum if they did not seek safe haven in a country they transited through first.
The rule, which accomplishes virtually the same thing being sought by the agreements, has faced legal challenges, however. A federal court initially blocked it from taking effect but the U.S. Supreme Court on Sept. 11 allowed it to be implemented while the court challenges are ongoing.
The bulk of migrants - mostly families - arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border are from the three northern triangle countries and many turn themselves in to border officials to ask for asylum in the United States.
President Donald Trump has made reducing the ballooning number of asylum claims, which have led to long backlogs in U.S. immigration courts, a top priority of his administration and has implemented a series of measures to try to discourage migrants from applying.
But immigrant advocates say sending people seeking refuge back to the region where they fled, even if not to their home country, violates international commitments meant to prevent vulnerable migrants from being returned to danger. The three countries have tiny asylum offices that could have trouble adequately processing a large number of claims, they say.
Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernandez has faced scrutiny over a court filing document related to the upcoming drug trafficking trial in New York of his brother, Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernandez. The president has denied any wrongdoing.
In a speech on Wednesday before the UN General Assembly, Hernandez again defended his political reputation against what he called “smears” from “criminals” and others, without outright referring to the allegations against him."

A recent US Supreme Court decision has jeopardized the asylum claims of tens of thousands of Central American, Caribbean, African, and Asian migrants hoping to enter the United States at the southern border. The decision has brought new anguish and uncertainties to those already facing desperate conditions in Mexico. On September 11, the court ruled 5–4 to allow the Trump administration’s new asylum restrictions to go into effect, pending ongoing litigation. With limited exceptions, the measure prohibits anyone from requesting asylum at the US–Mexico border who previously transited through another country, effectively banning all but Mexicans from seeking such protections. The asylum ban is the latest in an escalating effort to fence off the United States from the racialized global poor, while ICE purges the country from within. In the context of mounting economic and ecological crises, we are faced with an increasingly dire choice: surrendering to global apartheid, enforced by US imperial power, or a collective struggle, guided by solidarity.
Mexico Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) campaigned on a promise to respect migrants’ human rights, and in the first months of his term issued over 13,000 humanitarian visas to migrants transiting through the country to seek asylum at the US border. But the visa program was short-lived, and in June, after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican imports, AMLO’s administration committed to reducing US-bound migration, deploying the newly formed National Guard to its southern border and agreeing to host US asylum seekers under what’s known as the “Remain in Mexico” policy. Mexico’s top migration official resigned in protest. For Genoveva Roldán, economist and researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, it’s a lose-lose situation. “Mexico is a dependent country; it doesn’t have the means, the economic autonomy [to respond to Trump’s tariff threats] like China did, to enter into a trade war with the United States,” she says. “Mexico is acting with a boot to its throat.” The outcome of the negotiations, however, is disastrous. “With this, Mexico has already tacitly become a Safe Third Country,” says Roldán. Under international law, Safe Third Country agreements can oblige migrants to seek asylum in countries of transit that can provide them adequate protections. Mexico, plagued by organized crime, corruption, and impunity, cannot guarantee migrants’ safety, and the meager existing services and infrastructure for migrants are already overwhelmed. “They’ve put Mexico into a position where it’s not going to be able to respond,” she warns. Xenophobia is rising across Mexico, and a humanitarian crisis rages at both borders. Mexico has detained more than 108,000 migrants in 2019, over 32,000 of them children. Tens of thousands more wait their turn to present claims at the US border through an unofficial and arbitrary metering process. US hearings are now conducted remotely in “tent courts,” further violating migrants’ right to due process and diminishing their chances of securing protections. Since July, the Remain in Mexico program has forced more than 42,000 applicants back into Mexico to await their asylum proceedings, where they are vulnerable to kidnapping and extortion. At least fifteen children have died at the border this year. “It’s an abomination,” says a US immigration attorney who works with migrants in Mexico, speaking anonymously for fear of reprisals from Mexican and US authorities — we’ll call him Alex. “People are being killed after asking for asylum . . . It’s going to be studied in the history books as a stain. It already is a huge stain on the US.”
Central America All this comes as the United States is pressuring vulnerable Central American countries — themselves the principal source of the current exodus — to block migrants transiting toward the United States. Panama has resisted US overtures. Guatemala, however, appears poised to implement a Safe Third Country agreement signed by the outgoing president, despite misgivings from the president-elect. Under the deal, migrants who pass through Guatemalan territory will be required to seek asylum there; those who fail to do so will be ineligible for US protections and could be deported back to Guatemala. One of the most unequal economies in Latin America, Guatemala ranks in the top three countries of origin for US asylum seekers. El Salvador’s new president, who recently unveiled a new, US-financed border patrol, just made a deal with DHS to become a Safe Third Country in all but name. Honduras, wracked with violence and protest since a US-backed 2009 coup d’état installed a corrupt authoritarian regime, may soon yield as well. President Juan Orlando Hernández, currently implicated in a major US narco-trafficking investigation, is in negotiations with DHS to harbor Nicaraguan and Cuban asylum seekers — and prevent them from continuing north. As Alex points out, “these countries are in no condition to be able to house any significant number of refugees or asylees.” Devastated by decades of US-backed genocidal anticommunist wars and neoliberal economic restructuring, Central America has expelled millions of its citizens to the United States, and indeed depends on those migrants’ remittances for survival. The region boasts some of the highest homicide rates in the world, with social movement leaders particularly vulnerable to attacks. “Safe Third Countries need to be safe,” says Alex. “There will be legal challenges to this in the US, and hopefully there will continue to be some sort of opposition in Guatemala and Honduras, because these are obviously farcical.”
Life or Death The United States hopes to render Central America and Mexico into prisons, each border another brick in Trump’s wall. Authorities are slowing the process and erecting physical and legal barriers in the hopes of discouraging migrants through attrition, or forcibly sending them back. The result is further suffering and endangerment. Migrants seeking to evade the authorities risk being preyed upon by organized crime in Mexico, drowning in the Rio Grande, or being driven into deadly deserts in the US southwest. More than 7,000 Africans have been trapped for weeks in Tapachula, the site of Mexico’s principal migrant detention center on the southern border with Guatemala, as Mexican authorities refuse to provide them with safe passage north. Alex describes Tapachula as a “carceral city”: “There have been raids in public spaces, there’ve been raids in the hotels, so migrants aren’t as publicly visible anymore,” he says. “They’re trying to frustrate people and keep people in Tapachula, to make people fearful of being out in public. There’s a huge increase in checkpoints on the roads.” The poorest and most vulnerable migrants, especially those who cannot afford to hire a smuggler, bear the brunt of the crackdown. Alex explains: “It creates a situation where there’s an increase in corruption, because the officers are still very much amenable to bribes. It also increases the vulnerability of women and LGBT migrants of sexual assault. And the traffickers are still getting people by that are able to pay the fees. They just charge more money and pay off the officials to be able to get through.” For Bryan, a Honduran who separated from a caravan in January to request asylum in Mexico, the implementation of Trump’s asylum ban “will only create a darker, sadder panorama, with more deaths and many more problems for people who migrate. But in the end, they won’t stop the migration.” Bryan volunteers at a Mexico City shelter, where he provides migrants with legal information. He stresses the urgent need for humanitarian relief, especially for the growing numbers of those returning to the country through the Remain in Mexico program. “They come back here, and they don’t have any options. They seek out shelters, and the shelters are full of people heading north.” In a recent visit to the shelter, officials from the International Organization for Migration told Bryan that migrants are adults and responsible for their own decisions. “My response was, okay, but if you tell me I can die there or die here, what options do I have? That’s not much of a decision.”"

(Reuters: Joshua Roberts)
A federal judge in San Francisco restored a nationwide injunction on Monday preventing the Trump administration’s ban on asylum-seekers who travelled through a so-called safe third country before arriving in the U.S.
U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar issued the ruling after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in August narrowed his previous nationwide injunction, allowing the Trump administration to implement the asylum-rule change in Texas and New Mexico but not in California or Arizona.

In response to an overwhelming surge in asylum-seekers arriving at the southern border, the administration announced in July that migrants who travel through a safe third country before arriving in the U.S. must apply for, and be denied, refugee status in that country before they can apply for asylum in the U.S.
The rule change would effectively bar Central American migrants, who comprise the vast majority of recent asylum-seekers, from applying for asylum in the U.S. after crossing through Mexico. Tigar ruled to temporarily block it in July after concluding that it violated federal immigration law. He also blocked another policy change that would have barred asylum-seekers who cross the border between ports of entry rather than surrendering themselves to law-enforcement authorities.
Mexico deployed 6,000 troops to its southern border in June after President Trump threatened to impose substantial tariffs on Mexican imports if steps were not taken to stem the flow of Central American migrants traveling through the country en route to the U.S. The troop deployment, combined with seasonal changes in migration patterns, appears to be having an effect: U.S. Customs and Border Patrol announced Wednesday that the number of border apprehensions has declined by more than 56 percent since peaking in May at 144,255.

6552,"Judge blocks Trump's asylum ban along entire U.S.-Mexico border for second time""",CBS News,9/9/2019,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-blocks-trumps-asylum-ban-along-entire-us-mexico-border-again-today/,"A federal judge on Monday restored a nationwide scope on an order he issued earlier in the summer to block the Trump administration's most sweeping effort yet to unilaterally restrict the asylum system for migrants from Central America and other parts of the world who seek refuge at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Judge Jon Tigar of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California reinstated a nationwide injunction blocking a joint Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security rule that makes most migrants who transited through a third country — and did not seek refuge there — ineligible for asylum when they reach the U.S. at one of the country's land borders.
Last month, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals did not grant the government's request to issue an administrative stay on a previous ruling by Tigar that blocked this near-total asylum ban. But the court also said the injunction blocking the rule only applied within the court's jurisdiction, barring the administration from implementing the policy in California and Arizona, but allowing the rule to be enforced along the rest of the border, in New Mexico and Texas.

Through Monday's ruling, Tigar again prohibited the administration from implementing the rule anywhere along the southern border.

Immigration advocates praised Tigar's decision. Melissa Crow, a senior supervising attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center's Immigrant Justice Project, said the order removes a ""major hurdle"" for asylum-seeking migrants.
""This ruling levels the playing field for all the vulnerable individuals and families seeking refuge in the United States,"" Crow said in a statement. ""With this decision, regardless of where they cross the border, these people should be able to seek asylum.""
Late last month, the Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to stay Tigar's initial injunction and allow the administration to implement the asylum ban nationwide.
Administration officials have maintained that the rule would help curb what they call ""forum shopping"" by migrants. They have repeatedly accused migrants of preferring to seek asylum in the U.S., rather than in the countries along their journey that might be able to offer them safe haven.
The administration was quick to condemn Tigar's ruling on Monday, with Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan denouncing it as the latest example of ""judicial activism."" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the judge's decision will hinder what she referred to as the administration's efforts to ""reform"" the nation's ""broken asylum system.""
""Immigration and border security policy cannot be run by any single district court judge who decides to issue a nationwide injunction,"" Grisham added in a statement. ""This ruling is a gift to human smugglers and traffickers and undermines the rule of law."""

U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar had issued a nationwide injunction in July blocking the rule, which would make most asylum-seekers who pass through another country before reaching the U.S. ineligible for asylum, with exceptions for victims of trafficking and migrants who have been denied asylum in the countries they traveled through.

The rule would primarily effect Central American migrants crossing through Mexico.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Tigar's initial ruling but narrowed the injunction to only border states within its jurisdiction — California and Arizona — before sending the question back to Tigar.
Tigar said Monday that the injunction should apply nationwide because the asylum rule represents a case where ""such breadth is necessary to remedy a plaintiff's harm.""
The Trump administration last month asked the Supreme Court to lift Tigar's injunction.
""The injunction now in effect is deeply flawed and should be stayed pending appeal and pending any further proceedings in this Court,"" Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in a filing.
The White House blasted the judge's decision in a statement.
""Immigration and border security policy cannot be run by any single district court judge who decides to issue a nationwide injunction,"" the White House said. ""This ruling is a gift to human smugglers and traffickers and undermines the rule of law. We previously asked the Supreme Court to set aside the district court’s injunction in its entirety, our request remains pending with the Court, and we look forward to it acting on our request.""
Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan said Monday that he was ""frustrated"" by the ruling and described it as a result of ""unprecedented judicial activism.""
“It’s very very frustrating but we’re going to keep going. We’ll continue to work within the current legal framework address this,"" Morgan told reporters at the White House.

Ismail B. Ajjawi, a 17-year-old Palestinian student who lives in Tyre, Lebanon, landed at Boston Logan International airport on Friday night in anticipation of starting his freshman year at Harvard University.
But his Ivy League career, in which he intended to study in Chemical and Physical Biology, ended before it even began when his visa was revoked and he was deported back home.
Ajjawi said that after landing, immigration officers subjected him hours of questioning and searched his phone and computer, and confronted him about his friends' social media posts sharing their political views that spoke against the U.S., he said to school newspaper the Harvard Crimson.
Incoming Harvard University freshman Ismail B. Ajjawi, a 17-year-old Palestinian refugee living in Lebanon, had his visa revoked hours after landing in the U.S. Friday night
Ajjawi says he spent a total of eight hours in Boston, which has nearest airport to the Cambridge, Massachusetts university, before he was forced to leave.
After landing he and several other international students faced questioning from immigration officials. But Ajjawi was held back while his peers were allowed to go.
He alleges that an immigration officer continued to question him about his religion and religious practices in Lebanon. That officer then asked the student to unlock his phone and laptop and searched them for five hours, Ajjawi alleges.
The officer then asked him about his friends’ social media activity saying she found posts sharing political views that were against the US.
'When I asked every time to have my phone back so I could tell them about the situation, the officer refused and told me to sit back in [my] position and not move at all,' Ajjawi said.
'After the 5 hours ended, she called me into a room, and she started screaming at me. She said that she found people posting political points of view that oppose the US on my friend[s] list,' he added.
Ajjawi replied saying that the political posts were not his own.
'I responded that I have no business with such posts and that I didn't like, [s]hare or comment on them and told her that I shouldn't be held responsible for what others post,' he said.
'I have no single post on my timeline discussing politics,' he added.
Despite his defense, the immigration officer canceled Ajjawi's visa and told him he would be deported. Ajjawi was allowed a phone call to his parents before he returned to Lebanon.
Ajjawi is now in Lebanon and in contact with a lawyer and the university with the hopes of resolving his visa before classes start next Tuesday September 3.
U. S. Customs and Border Protection told the Crimson they found Ajjawi 'inadmissible' to the country.
'Applicants must demonstrate they are admissible into the U.S. by overcoming ALL grounds of inadmissibility including health-related grounds, criminality, security reasons, public charge, labor certification, illegal entrants and immigration violations, documentation requirements, and miscellaneous grounds,' the statement said.
'This individual was deemed inadmissible to the United States based on information discovered during the CBP inspection.'
Harvard says they're in contact with the family and working to bring him back to campus.
'The University is working closely with the student’s family and appropriate authorities to resolve this matter so that he can join his classmates in the coming days,' a university spokesman said.
Harvard's International Office employs immigration lawyers who work to resolve visa-related issues international students encounter. Ajjawi says he's been in contact with Harvard International Office Director of Immigration Services Maureen Martin.
He was coming to Harvard on a scholarship given by AMIDEAST, a nonprofit, which is now aiding him with legal assistance.
Harvard Admissions did not immediately return DailyMail.com's request for comment.
Ajjawi says he was held at the Boston Logon international airport for eight hours and allegedly questioned for five hours, before immigration officials rescinded his visa and deported him
His deportation has sparked outrage among his friends.
'Deporting him back is of course unfair act, he is a very clever student and it is not appropriate to act with him this way,' Ajjawi's friend Selah Chehade said to DailyMail.com.
Ajjawi's revoked visa comes after the bright student was highlighted on a local news site Alaraby Entertainment about his success story, from being a refugee in Lebanon to getting into the coveted Ivy League school on a full scholarship.
'This was always my goal; I did everything with this goal in mind, including managing my time wisely and studying as much as I can,' Ajjawi said in the news video.
'My plan is to become a doctor. I’m going to major in Chemical and Physical Biology at Harvard, as a pre-med student, and then I will go on to medical school,' he added.
'My success, that of a Palestinian refugee in Lebanon, shows that Palestinians can be high achievers and attain success, despite their circumstances.'
His father was also included in that news cast, who proudly gushed about his son's success saying: 'This was a very happy moment for us, that all of his hard work paid off. Despite the severe hardships that the Palestinian people face, we are achieving high success.'
'I'm so proud of him and God willing he will be a good representative and example for Palestinians abroad.'"

Ajjawi, like many of his fellow students, was set to arrive on campus for the first time this week. But the 17-year-old Palestinian’s hard-won education at perhaps the world’s preeminent university is now in doubt. American immigration officials stopped Ajjawi, a Palestinian resident of Tyre, Lebanon, at Boston Logan International Airport on Friday night, the Crimson reports, where he was held in custody for eight hours and subjected to invasive questioning by a female immigration officer, who then abruptly told him his study visa was being canceled and that he was being deported.
“Upon arrival, Ajjawi faced questioning from immigration officials along with several other international students. While the other students were allowed to leave, Ajjawi alleges an immigration officer continued to question him about his religion and religious practices in Lebanon,” according to the Crimson. “The same officer then asked him to unlock his phone and laptop, and left to search them for roughly five hours, Ajjawi alleges.

3199,Trump official revises Statue of Liberty poem to defend migrant rule change',BBC News,8/14/2019,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49323324,"Image copyright Getty Images
A top US immigration official has revised a quote inscribed on the Statue of Liberty in defence of a new policy that denies food aid to legal migrants.
The head of Citizenship and Immigration Services tweaked the passage: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"".
The official added the words ""who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge"".
He later said the poem had referred to ""people coming from Europe"".
Ken Cuccinelli, the Trump administration's acting head of Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced on Monday a new ""public charge"" requirement that limits legal migrants from seeking certain public benefits such as public housing or food aid, or are considered likely to do so in the future.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The New Colossus was written by New York-born poet Emma Lazarus in 1883
The new regulation, known as a ""public charge rule"", was published in the Federal Register on Monday and will take effect on 15 October.
The rule change is intended to reinforce ""ideals of self-sufficiency"", officials said. Critics argue that it will prevent low-income US residents from seeking help.
What did the official say?
On Tuesday, Mr Cuccinelli was asked by NPR whether the 1883 poem titled The New Colossus at the Statue of Liberty still applied.
""Would you also agree that Emma Lazarus's words etched on the Statue of Liberty, 'Give me your tired, give me your poor,' are also a part of the American ethos?"" asked NPR's Rachel Martin.

""They certainly are,"" Mr Cuccinelli responded. ""Give me your tired and your poor - who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.""
""That plaque was put on the Statue of Liberty at almost the same time as the first public charge [law] was passed - very interesting timing,"" he added.
The actual passage reads in part: ""Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!""
In the interview, he added that immigrants are welcome ""who can stand on their own two feet, be self-sufficient, pull themselves up by their bootstraps, again, as in the American tradition"".
After the host asked if the policy ""appears to change the definition of the American dream,"" he said: ""We invite people to come here and join us as a privilege.
""No one has a right to become an American who isn't born here as an American.""
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Top immigration official says public charge rule will not target ""any particular group""
Mr Cuccinelli was pressed later on CNN about his comments, and pushed back on claims he was trying to re-write the poem. He insisted he was answering a question and accused people on the left of ""twisting"" his comments.
Then asked by anchor Erin Burnett about what America stands for, he said: ""Of course that poem was referring back to people coming from Europe - where they had class-based societies where people were considering wretched if they weren't in the right class.""
The two then discussed their own immigrant ancestry, with Ms Burnett pointing out his rule would have ""excluded"" her family.
""I'm here because they were allowed in, and I'm an anchor on CNN,"" she said.
Beto O'Rouke, a Democratic presidential hopeful from Texas, shared a clip from the interview and said the comments show his Trump administration ""think the Statue of Liberty only applies to white people"".
Who will be affected by the new rule?
Immigrants who are already permanent residents in the US are unlikely to be affected by the rule change.
It also does not apply to refugees and asylum applicants.
But applicants for visa extensions, green cards or US citizenship will be subject to the change.
Those who do not meet income standards or who are deemed likely to rely on benefits such as Medicaid (government-run healthcare) or housing vouchers in future may be blocked from entering the country.
Those already in the US could also have their applications rejected.
An estimated 22 million legal residents in the US are without citizenship, and many of these are likely to be affected.
President Trump has made immigration a central theme of his administration. This latest move is part of his government's efforts to curb legal immigration.
What has reaction been?
The Democratic led House Homeland Security Committee condemned Mr Cuccinelli's revision in a tweet, calling the words ""vile and un-American"".
""It's clear the Trump Administration just wants to keep certain people out,"" the committee wrote, calling Mr Cuccinelli ""a xenophobic, anti-immigrant fringe figure who has no business being in government"".
Others pointed to his background as the attorney general of Virginia, in which he led a conservative campaign against immigration and homosexuality.
Asked about Mr Cuccinelli's remarks on Tuesday, President Trump did not directly respond to the Statue of Liberty quote, but said: ""I don't think it's fair to have the American taxpayer pay for people to come into the United States.""
""I'm tired of seeing our taxpayer paying for people to come into the country and immediately go onto welfare and various other things.
""So I think we're doing it right."""
5680,Does The Statue Of Liberty Poem Invalidate U.S. Borders Or Require Giving Welfare To Non-Citizens?',The Federalist,8/14/2019,,,https://thefederalist.com/2019/08/13/statue-liberty-poem-invalidate-u-s-borders-require-giving-welfare-non-citizens/,"Acting Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli announced a change in the “public charge” rule Monday that will deny green cards for immigrants on Medicaid, food stamps, housing vouchers, and other public welfare. It of course elicited liberally charged questions from reporters.
The “public charge” rule, enacted in 1882, requires green card applicants to prove they will not be a burden to the United States. The new changes, detailed in an 800-page document going into effect mid-October, will determine “the totality of the circumstances when making a public charge inadmissibility determination.”
“Through the public charge rule, President Trump’s administration is re-enforcing the ideal of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility, ensuring that immigrants are able to support themselves and become successful in America,” Cuccinelli said in the press conference.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) arrests of several hundred illegal aliens in Mississippi last week incited yet another cycle of media outrage. Several White House reporters asked Cuccinelli about it. One quoted the poetic sentiment engraved on the Statue of Liberty, “Give me your tired, your poor…” Is this sentiment, he asked, still operative in the United States, or should it be removed from our statue?
The reporter was referring to the poem “The New Colossus,” written by Emma Lazarus in 1883. At the end of the poem Lady Liberty cries out, “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
This image of a destitute newcomer may seem in conflict with Cuccinelli’s self-sufficient immigrant. Is there a discrepancy in America’s immigration ethos? Are Lady Liberty’s words a reachable reality or a utopia? The answer typically depends on which side of the aisle you stand.
The first ideal says it is the government’s humanitarian duty to welcome all poor seeking refuge in the United States. All who come to our borders deserve to be wrapped with taxpayer-funded welfare blankets, no matter how bankrupt our systems are. These ideals are espoused by the left.
The second ideal is rooted in right-wing ideals of small government. It is not the government’s job to provide housing vouchers and Medicaid for everyone. The government’s first priority is to American citizens, and immigration policies and border controls are for our protection. We welcome immigrants here seeking the freedom that requires them to govern and provide for themselves.
One reporter asked in the press conference, “Why shouldn’t the Latino community feel targeted by this?”
“This is 140-year-old legal structure,” Cuccinelli said. “We’re dealing with the most recent iteration of it, but this is not new… There’s no reason for any particular group to feel like this is targeting them.”
America cannot save the world from all suffering. Americans cannot afford to support welfare for any person in the world who gets here and then demands it. That does not change the spirit of our immigration laws that welcomes those made poor and needy by totalitarian governments that take wealth from some and redistribute it to others in currently politically favored groups.
“We have a long history of being one of the most welcoming nations in the world on a lot of bases, whether you be an asylee, whether you be coming here to join your family, or immigrating yourself,” Cuccinelli said. “I do not think by any means, we’re ready to take anything off the Statue of Liberty.”"

(Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)
The Department of Homeland Security released a new regulation on Monday that would severely limit the number of impoverished migrants eligible to enter and remain in the U.S. legally by requiring that visa applicants not be reliant on public services.
Under the expanded public-charge rule, which was added to the Federal Register on Monday, the authorities will consider an immigrant’s use of non-cash government-assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid, as a negative factor in determining their eligibility for a green card or temporary visa.

Since 1996, the public-charge rule has only applied to cash-assistance programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and the Supplemental Security Income program.
The rule change will affect those migrants seeking to enter the U.S. and those who entered the country illegally but wish to obtain legal status. DHS officials will take into account would-be immigrants’ education, skills, employment history, health, and a number of other factors to determine whether they are likely to become dependent on the government.
Immigrant-rights advocates argue that the rule change will force needy families to choose between much-needed public services and their desire to secure lawful permanent residency.

The looming threat of the rule change, which was first proposed in October 2018, led one in seven adults in immigrant families to forego public services, according to a study by the Urban Institute.

White House adviser Steven Miller led the rule-change effort and was aided by the elevation of Ken Cuccinelli to director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services earlier this year, according to the New York Times.

6996,"White House: New immigration policy meant to promote 'self-sufficiency and personal responsibility'""",The Hill,8/12/2019,,,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/457093-white-house-defends-new-immigration-policy,"Acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli on Monday defended a controversial Trump administration rule that would link an immigrant's ability to secure green cards to their use of certain public programs.
Cuccinelli told reporters at the White House that the ""public charge"" change promotes “the ideals of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility.”

""We certainly expect people of any income to be able to stand on their own two feet. If people are not able to be self-sufficient, then this negative factor is going to bear very heavily against them in a decision about whether they’ll be able to become a legal permanent resident,"" he said.
“A poor person can be prepared to be self-sufficient. Many have been through the history of this country. Let’s not look at that as the be all and end all, it’s not the deciding factor. Which is why we continue to use the totality of circumstances test.”
Under the rule set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, receiving benefits like food stamps, Medicaid or housing subsidies will count negatively against a noncitizen's chance of getting a green card or visa. The ""public charge"" designation previously only singled out noncitizens receiving cash subsidies. Immigration advocacy groups have expressed concerns that expanding the designation could discourage immigrants from seeking necessary assistance.
Cuccinelli's mention of a ""totality of circumstances test"" refers to the holistic evaluation immigration officials will make over public charge designation, which also includes age and health.
One reporter asked whether the rule change signals a shift from the promise on the Statue of Liberty to welcome ""your tired, your poor.""
""I’m certainly not prepared to take anything down off the Statue of Liberty. We have a long history of being one of the most welcoming nations in the world on a lot of bases,"" Cuccinelli responded. ""Whether you be an asylee, whether you be coming here to joining your family, or immigrating yourself.""
Cuccinelli was also pressed on criticism that the rule change targets Hispanic communities in particular.
""First of all, this is 140-year-old legal structure,"" he said. ""We’re dealing with the most recent iteration of it, but this is not new. This was the same question might have been asked when my Italian immigrant ancestors were coming in, and all through that 140 years.""
When asked again about the majority of those likely to be affected being Hispanic, Cuccinelli said that ""if we had been having this conversation 100 years ago it would’ve applied to more Italians.”

6777,The Trump Administration Just Made It Harder To Apply For Green Cards And Visas',HuffPost,8/12/2019,,,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/public-charge-department-of-homeland-security-final-rule_n_5d449198e4b0ca604e31fb51,"The Department of Homeland Security officially published a change to what’s known as the “public charge” rule on Monday that would make it much harder to apply for a green card or earn a visa. The new policy, which is set to go into effect in mid-October, expands the definition of what would make an applicant likely to become a “public charge,” someone who the government has deemed would be dependent on it, thus rendering them ineligible for legal permanent residency status.
In October 2018, the DHS released its proposal for expanding the criteria for what constitutes a “public charge” to include those receiving non-cash government services, like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), when evaluating applications for visas and legal permanent residency. Currently, people are generally only considered public charges if they use cash assistance or long-term institutional care the government is funding.
The rule change also creates other factors to be weighed in consideration of the “totality of circumstances” aspect of the rule when evaluating green cards and visa applications including English proficiency, income level and health conditions. (Refugees and asylum-seekers, among others, are exempted from the rule.)
After the release of the DHS proposal, the rule went through a 60-day public comment period, during which the department received over 260,000 comments about the proposal. It reached the desk of the Office of Management and Budget on July 12.
Currently, the limited public charge definition means the regulation is not often used to justify the rejection of an application.
The administration is purporting to solve the “the alleged but illusory problem that immigrants are eating up taxpayer funds,” said Doug Rand, an Obama administration veteran who co-founded Boundless Immigration, a technology company that helps immigrants get green cards and citizenship. Rand added the change “makes no sense,” as undocumented immigrants are not allowed to access federal public benefits. He also said that the proposal was the administration’s effort at making “profound” changes to the immigration system without congressional approval.
Andrew Harnik/AP Photo The Department of Homeland security has published a change to the public charge rule, which will have ""chilling effects"" on millions of immigrants.
A study released in July found that 8.3 million children, most of whom are citizens, enrolled in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program or SNAP are at potential risk of being disenrolled, with more than 5 million of those children having specific medical needs. The researchers predict that between nearly 1 and 2 million children with specific medical needs will ultimately be disenrolled as a result of the rule change.
The rule’s public benefits component will not be applied retroactively, meaning those seeking green cards and visas who were enrolled in these public benefits programs before the rule was enacted will not be penalized for it.
The English proficiency criteria “privileges people from certain countries where English is already spoken,” according to Jackie Vimo, a policy analyst at the National Immigration Law Center.
The change to the public charge is one of multiple instances of the Trump administration attempting to change immigration policy without having to go through Congress. There’s also the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s proposal released on May 10 to halt eligibility for families with members holding different immigration statuses, or “mixed-status” families, in public and Section 8 housing, as well as other changes to the public charge rule and its enforcement.
Together, these changes “turn our immigration system into green cards for the highest bidder,” Vimo said.
While only those seeking green cards and visas are impacted by the rule, experts warn of a “chilling effect” that will prompt eligible immigrants to unenroll in government services. The chilling effect has already begun due to the fear generated by the proposal, ever since the idea was first reported on in February 2018.
A study from May found that one in seven adults in immigrant families have avoided public benefits programs, including some who would not be affected by the rule.
Rand believes that the “chilling effect is part of the intent.”
“A very large number of people are likely to disenroll from public benefits from which they are perfectly entitled under U.S. law,” he said.
In a letter sent July 24 obtained by HuffPost, 18 state attorneys general, spearheaded by Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson (D), claimed the Department of Homeland Security “entirely failed” in their estimation of the cost of their proposed public charge rule change. The lawmakers requested a meeting with the agency to further discuss the officials’ “significant concerns about the severe impact” of the proposed rule on their residents. They argue the rules would cause “extensive injury” to the economies of their states and to their states’ residents — it would cause loss of health insurance, medical access, and food and cash benefits.
“If implemented as proposed, the rules will result in a reduction of total economic output, a drop in workers’ wages, and elimination of jobs in our states,” the attorneys general wrote. The OMB did not accept their request for a meeting.
Ferguson told HuffPost that they are “exploring our legal options” and “actively preparing for a potential lawsuit” and that he is “confident you’ll see litigation from the states on the matter.”
The city of Baltimore and nonprofit public policy organization Democracy Forward sued President Donald Trump and the Department of State in November 2018 for their attempt to alter the public charge rules. They argued the Trump administration moved forward with its plans despite understanding that the rule change would deter lawfully present immigrants and naturalized citizens from obtaining the services they need and are eligible for."

ICE agents conducted the largest single-state raid in United States history and the largest workplace raid in the last 11 years when they arrested 680 illegal aliens at seven food processing plants across six cities in Mississippi, including plants in Bay Springs, Carthage, Canton, Morton, Pelahatchie, and Sebastapol.
Not since 2008 — when about 595 illegal workers were arrested — has this many illegal aliens been arrested in a workplace raid by ICE.
According to federal officials, some of the hundreds of illegal aliens arrested on Wednesday have already been ordered deported by an immigration judge and have refused to self-deport. Those illegal aliens will be quickly deported.
Other illegal aliens have yet to go through the immigration courts and will be afforded a review process where they will make a case to remain in the U.S.
U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi Mike Hurst told the media at a press conference:
We are first and foremost a nation of laws and the Rule of Law is the bedrock, the very foundation, of our great country. I heard someone say that a country without borders is not a country at all and while I agree with that, I would also add that without law there is no order. Without the enforcement of law, there is no justice.
The food processing plants raided by ICE include the Koch Foods Inc. facility in Morton, Mississippi. The plant is not associated with the GOP mega-donor billionaires Charles and David Koch.
ICE officials said the investigation into the illegal aliens and their employers is ongoing and could not comment on specifics of the case.
“These are not victimless crimes,” an ICE official said. “Illegal workers create vulnerabilities in the marketplace … as well as stealing the identities of legal U.S. workers, citizens, and legal immigrants alike, who must suffer the long-lasting consequences of their stolen identities.”

Federal immigration officials raided several food-processing plants in Mississippi on Wednesday and arrested approximately 680 people believed to be working in the U.S. without authorization.
The coordinated raids were conducted by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations ""at seven agricultural processing plants across Mississippi,"" according to an ICE statement. In addition to the arrests, agents seized company business records.
More than 600 ICE agents were involved in the raids, surrounding the perimeters of the targeted plants to prevent workers, mainly Latino immigrants, from escaping. The actions were centered on plants near Jackson owned by five companies, according to The Associated Press.
One of the plants is owned by Koch Foods Inc., which bills itself as one of the largest poultry processors in the U.S. with more than 13,000 employees. Forbes ranks it as the 135th largest privately held company in the country, with an estimated $3.2 billion in annual revenue, according to Fortune.
Another plant raided Wednesday is in Canton, Miss., and is owned by Peco Foods Inc., based in Tuscaloosa, Ala. It is the eighth-largest poultry producer in the U.S., according to the company's website.
No representatives for either company responded to an email request or telephone call for comment.
The arrested workers were bused to a local Mississippi National Guard hangar, where they were interviewed about their immigration status, including whether they already had deportation orders.
""Today's raids are part of the ongoing war against immigrant families and the communities in which they live,"" Julia Solórzano, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in an emailed statement. ""It is especially sickening that days after immigrants were targeted by a gunman in El Paso, Texas, workers at plants across Mississippi witnessed armed agents descending on their workplace.
""It's also worth noting that immigration agencies that have repeatedly blamed 'over capacity' detention facilities for the horrific treatment of those imprisoned nevertheless detained more than 600 people today,"" she said.
The size of the raid operation harks back to 2008 when, under the George W. Bush administration, more than 400 unauthorized workers were arrested in a meatpacking facility in Iowa."
6955,"Families ""Are Scared To Death"" After A Massive ICE Operation Swept Up Hundreds Of People'",BuzzFeed News,8/8/2019,,,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/ice-raid-operation-mississippi-workplace-families,"On Wednesday morning, Dianne received an alarming call. It was her fiancé, dialing her from the chicken processing plant in a nearby central Mississippi town where he worked long shifts deboning meat.
“ICE is here!” he yelled. In the background, Dianne could hear other laborers terrified. The panic was palpable. One worker called out in Spanish, “Ayúdame! [Help me!]”
Dianne’s fiancé, who came to the country more than two decades ago from Mexico without authorization, told her he had no way out and would not be able to escape immigration enforcement agents. His voice trembling, he told Dianne that she needed to make a promise before he got off the line: “Take care of my kids.”
What the workers at the plant didn’t realize in that moment was they were about to be arrested in one of the largest worksite operations ever conducted by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. In total, some 680 suspected undocumented workers were arrested Wednesday after ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations agents swept through seven agricultural plants in the state as part of a criminal investigation. Deportation officers and HSI agents arrested the workers as they served criminal search warrants at the food plants.
Dianne’s fiancé is the father to three children, ages 13, 15, and 19, with his ex-wife, who was also undocumented and worked at a separate food plant in the area.
Not long after Dianne’s phone call with her fiancé, she found out that the kids’ mother was also arrested. Dianne, who requested her last name not be used for fear of consequences for her fiancé, sped to the local school, where she witnessed other adults coming to pick up children whose parents had been arrested. Some parents, she said, weren’t able to retrieve kids because they hadn’t been listed as authorized guardians.
On her way out of the school, she saw one girl looking confused, not knowing where to go because her parents had been arrested too.
“They were crying. They were shocked. They’re just worried,” Dianne said of her fiancé’s children. “I’m just trying to stay strong for them. I’m trying to remain as calm as possible. It’s one thing to know this could happen but it is another to see it happening. This is heart-wrenching. They are scared.”
Details of the targets of the immigration operation, which was conducted in partnership with the local US attorney’s office, were not immediately available as officials said the investigation was ongoing.
“We are a nation of laws, and we will remain so by continuing to enforce our laws and ensuring that justice is done,” said US Attorney Mike Hurst.
ICE officials said that each worker arrested would be evaluated for potential release on humanitarian grounds."

In a 5-4 decision, the justices of the U.S. high court said President Trump can shift about $2.5 billion in military funds to construct an additional 100 miles of wall at the U.S.-Mexico border in an effort to seal off the U.S. from illegal immigration.

""We've long been working with Guatemala and now we can do it the right way,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, with Guatemalan interior minister Enrique Degenhart at his side.
TRUMP VOWS RETALIATORY TARIFF ON FRANCE, SLAMS 'FOOLISH' TAX ON AMERICAN TECH GIANTS
Trump told reporters he believes “this will really help” with the situation at the border.
“This is a very big day,” he said.
The agreement would require migrants, including Salvadorans and Hondurans, who cross into Guatemala on their way to the U.S. to apply for protections in Guatemala instead of at the U.S. border. It could potentially ease the crush of migrants overwhelming the U.S. immigration system and hand Trump a concession he could herald as a win as he struggles to live up to his campaign promises on immigration.
The announcement comes after a court in California blocked Trump's most restrictive asylum effort to date, one that would effectively end protections at the southern border.
The two countries had been negotiating such an agreement for months, and Trump threatened Wednesday to place tariffs or other consequences on Guatemala if it didn't reach a deal.
It's not clear how the agreement will take effect. Guatemala's Constitutional Court has granted three injunctions preventing its government from entering into a deal without approval of the country's congress.

4184,"Here's how many Mexicans want migrants to be deported back to Central America""",TheBlaze.com,7/20/2019,,,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mexicans-polled-are-against-immigration,"A new poll of citizens in Mexico says that a majority are against the entrance of migrants from Central America to their country on their way to seek asylum in the United States.
The poll from the Washington Post and Reforma, a leading Mexican newspaper, found that nearly two thirds of Mexicans polled, 64 percent, said that migrants were a ""burden"" that took jobs and benefits away from their citizens.
The issue has become more contentious for Mexican nationals after President Donald Trump began a new policy of metering asylum seekers at the border, and making many wait in Mexico for the results of their request.
A video from Newsy featured a female Mexican citizen who angrily chanted, ""you are not welcome here!"" in a protest against migrants.
The poll also said that a majority, 55 percent, of Mexican citizens polled wanted the migrants to be deported back to their home countries.
Only a third polled, 33 percent, said that Mexico should give migrants temporary asylum or residency. A very small percentage, 7 percent, said they wanted the country to give them permanent residency.
The Mexican government has responded to pressure from Trump by offering more migrants benefits if they agree to stay in Mexico and abandon their attempt to seek asylum from the United States.
However, the Mexican to the United States, Martha Bárcena, said there's a limit to how long the country can host those seeking asylum.
""So we're working with our Central American neighbors to see what we can do so that people do not come to the border,"" Bárcena said.
""We maybe hold people for half a year,"" she added, ""one year, but not two years if the asylum process just goes on and on.""
Here's a video about the poll from Newsy:"
3329,"Unauthorized immigrants face public backlash in Mexico, survey finds'",Washington Post,7/20/2019,,,https://beta.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/unauthorized-immigrants-face-public-backlash-in-mexico-survey-finds/2019/07/16/f7fc5d12-a75e-11e9-a3a6-ab670962db05_story.html,"Those findings defy the perception that Mexico — a country that has sent millions of its own migrants to the United States, sending billions of dollars in remittances — is sympathetic to the surge of Central Americans. Instead, the data suggests Mexicans have turned against the migrants transiting through their own country, expressing antipathy that would be familiar to many supporters of President Trump north of the border.
The face-to-face survey among 1,200 Mexican adults was conducted after a sharp increase in immigration enforcement by Mexico following a June agreement with the Trump administration. Trump promised that deal would reduce the number of migrants crossing into the United States. He threatened to impose major tariffs on Mexico unless it complied.

For a year, Mexicans watched as a growing number of Central Americans moved through the country on their way to the U.S. border. Some of those migrants traveled by foot and bus in large caravans, sleeping in small-town plazas and relying on donations of food and clothes. Once they reached Mexico’s northern border, the migrants waited months for the United States to process their asylum claims, often overwhelming local shelters.
While migration from Central America through Mexico has existed for years, the overall increase in migrants as well as their more visible modes of transit turned the phenomenon into a public lightning rod. The Trump administration’s immigration policy, which forces many asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their hearings, increased the pool of migrants in northern Mexico and exacerbated the frustration felt by many Mexicans.
The Post-Reforma survey finds 7 percent of Mexicans say their country should offer residency to Central American immigrants traveling through Mexico and trying to enter the United States. Another 33 percent support allowing them to stay temporarily while the United States decides whether to admit them. But a 55 percent majority says they should be deported to their home countries.
AD

When Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador agreed to step up Mexico’s immigration enforcement to avert U.S. tariffs, many analysts expected his base to be disillusioned. López Obrador had long advocated for migrants’ rights and the freedom of movement for asylum seekers.
But 51 percent of Mexicans support using the country’s newly formed national guard to combat migration of undocumented immigrants in Mexico, a key provision of the agreement. Just under half of Mexicans have heard about the June agreement, but among those who have, 59 percent favor it ,while 34 percent are opposed.
Some dissatisfaction with the migration pact may come from López Obrador supporters who believe the agreement is unsympathetic toward Central Americans in search of refuge. But in parts of Mexico, the most vocal critique of the deal is that it has forced Mexican cities to contend with a growing pool of asylum seekers. In some northern cities, rumors have spread that African migrants are carrying Ebola. In others, officials say they’ve simply run out of places for migrants to stay.
AD
AD
Last week, for example, the governors of three northern Mexican states, Coahuila, Nuevo León and Tamaulipas, signed a statement saying that they could not accept any more migrants. They blamed López Obrador’s administration for allowing so many asylum seekers to wait along Mexico’s northern border without offering more resources to the region.
By August, Mexico expects to receive 60,000 asylum seekers who are forced by the United States to wait for their hearings on Mexican soil. López Obrador has said those migrants will be given work permits, but it remains unclear who will provide their shelter or food. Many are likely to spend months in Mexico before they are granted or denied asylum in the United States.
“The number [of migrants] that the federal government is talking about is impossible for us to deal with,” said Miguel Ángel Riquelme Solís, governor of Coahuila, at a news conference.

A total of 11.6 million documented and undocumented Mexican migrants live in the United States, but unauthorized migration from Mexico has declined sharply over the past decade. The Post-Reforma poll shows 78 percent of Mexicans say it’s harder to migrate to the United States than five years ago. This year, Guatemalans are on track to make up the largest group of migrants apprehended at the U.S. border. It would be the first time in recent history when Mexicans do not make up the largest group of migrants by nationality.
López Obrador holds a 70 percent job approval rating eight months after entering office, a strong standing albeit down from 78 percent in a Reforma poll in March. While he took office as a lifelong populist, López Obrador quickly had to respond to threats from Trump, mostly about immigration enforcement. Many expected López Obrador — who once compared Trump’s hostility toward Mexicans to the way Adolf Hitler spoke of Jews — to condemn the U.S. president. Instead, he has largely submitted to Trump’s demands on migration.
That posture prompted many Mexican public intellectuals to deride López Obrador as a puppet of the U.S. president. Commentators suggested that Mexico may not have paid for Trump’s border wall, but it had effectively “become the wall.”
AD
AD
Yet the Post-Reforma poll suggests that such an approach hasn’t eroded López Obrador’s popularity very much. A 54 percent majority say he is standing up for Mexico’s interests in his dealings with Trump, though a similar 55 percent say the recent immigration agreement was imposed upon Mexico by the United States rather than being negotiated by the two nations.
López Obrador gets relatively high marks for his treatment of migrants, with 44 percent saying he has done a good job on the issue and 27 percent rating him negatively.
Mexicans continue to have an overwhelmingly negative opinion about Trump. More than three-quarters of Mexicans dislike Trump, according to the survey, and more than 8 in 10 say he treats their country with disrespect.
The Post-Reforma poll finds a scant 2 percent of Mexicans name immigration as their country’s most important problem, with a 55 percent majority citing insecurity and 9 percent each mentioning corruption and unemployment. Another 7 percent name the economy, followed by 4 percent each who say poverty, political problems and social problems are the country’s more pressing concerns.
AD
AD
A sizable minority of Mexicans see migrants as a safety risk, with 39 percent believing they commit more crimes than Mexicans; 21 percent believe they commit fewer crimes, and 31 percent don’t see any difference.
Mexicans’ views of immigrants appear to have soured sharply in the past year. A 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center found 57 percent said immigrants mainly strengthen Mexico, while 37 percent said they weaken it. The Post-Reforma poll asked a similar question and found opinion reversed: 64 percent of Mexicans say migrants are mainly a burden on the country, and 20 percent see them as strengthening it.
Despite concerns about security and immigration, Mexicans are positive on balance about their country’s trajectory. Some 40 percent say Mexico is on the right track, while 26 percent think it’s on the wrong track, and 32 percent fall in the middle.
A 53 percent majority reports trust in the national guard, which was launched by López Obrador and has played a major role in increased immigration enforcement. Two-thirds of Mexicans say they would like the national guard to be in their city, and 45 percent say they feel more safe with the force in place.
López Obrador receives positive marks on fighting poverty, corruption, dealing with education and health issues. His ratings for some other issues are underwater — 45 percent give him negative marks on fighting drug trafficking and organized crime (24 percent rate him positively), and 41 percent rate him negatively on security (while 32 percent give him positive marks).

The survey was jointly sponsored by The Washington Post and Reforma. It was conducted July 9-14 among 1,200 Mexican adults through face-to-face interviews in 100 election districts across the country. The overall results have an error margin of plus or minus five percentage points."
2273,Poll: Mexicans Favor Deporting Migrants Back To Their Home Countries',NPR Online News,7/20/2019,,,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/18/742981757/poll-mexicans-favor-deporting-migrants-back-to-their-home-countries,"Poll: Mexicans Favor Deporting Migrants Back To Their Home Countries
More than 60 percent of Mexicans believe migrants are a burden and that they take away jobs and benefits, according to a recent poll. A majority supports deporting them.
NOEL KING, HOST:
Last month, Mexico made a deal with the United States to crack down on Central American migrants who are trying to make their way to the U.S. border. In June, Mexico arrested and deported the highest number of migrants in more than 10 years, and there were questions about how this tough approach would play in Mexico. But new public polling shows that Mexicans are in favor of this strategy. James Fredrick has the story from Mexico City.
JAMES FREDRICK, BYLINE: A poll conducted by The Washington Post and Mexican newspaper Reforma shows 55% of respondents think migrants should be deported back to their home country. For years, the largest share of migrants going to the U.S. came from Mexico. But now with thousands of Central Americans fleeing violence, repression and poverty, Mexico has become primarily a transit country for migrants. Late last year, when a large migrant caravan marched through Mexico, polls showed a majority of Mexicans thought their country should help the caravan. But support for migrants has eroded since. Claudia Leon Ang studies migration in Mexico and is the operations director of the Jesuit Refugee Service. She says anti-immigrant sentiment often comes from local media.
CLAUDIA LEON ANG: (Speaking Spanish).
FREDRICK: She says the content and style of local news often frames migrants as criminals. It's a compelling narrative in a country experiencing its highest levels of violent crime ever. But she says there's no evidence that immigrants are a driving force behind crime. Another issue is the growing number of asylum-seekers stuck in Mexico. Under a U.S. policy known as Remain in Mexico, nearly 20,000 asylum-seekers have been sent back to Mexico to wait months or even years for their asylum case to be heard in the U.S. But 6 in 10 people polled said migrants are a burden on the country. Here's Claudia Leon again.
ANG: (Speaking Spanish).
FREDRICK: She says, in a country with so much inequality, poverty and abandonment by public institutions, you're going to generate resentment. It seems this is now a fight of the poor versus the poor, she says. Another important detail in the poll, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whose administration is leading the crackdown on migrants, has a 70% approval rating. The Mexican government may have public support, but it faces steeper challenges as tens of thousands of people hoping to request asylum in the U.S. may now be stuck in Mexico surrounded by a public that doesn't want them.

6975,"Trump administration sets 'new bar' for immigrants seeking asylum""",Reuters,7/15/2019,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-thirdparty/trump-administration-sets-new-bar-for-immigrants-seeking-asylum-idUSKCN1UA1IL,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Monday unveiled a new rule to bar almost all immigrants from applying for asylum at the southern border, requiring them to first pursue safe haven in a third country through which they had traveled on the way to the United States.
The Department of Homeland Security, in a statement issued with the Department of Justice, said the rule would set a “new bar” for immigrants “by placing further restrictions or limitations on eligibility for aliens who seek asylum in the United States.”
The American Civil Liberties Union called the new rule “patently unlawful” and vowed to file a lawsuit against it, while a host of experts also questioned its legality.
“The interim regulation violates the clear language of the law in several respects,” Stephen Legomsky, a former chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, told Reuters in an email.
The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR said it was “deeply concerned” about the measure, saying it would “put vulnerable families at risk” and undermine international efforts to find a coordinated solution.
Designated an “interim final rule,” the measure goes into effect on Tuesday, potentially shifting the burden onto poorly equipped countries like Mexico and Guatemala to process asylum claims.
The rule would make it all but impossible for asylum-seekers to gain legal entry to the United States unless they first apply for asylum in a “third country.”
The proposed changes represent the latest effort by the Trump administration to crack down on immigration, the signature issue that helped propel Trump to the White House in the 2016 election and one already figuring prominently in the 2020 campaign.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Trump administration had overreached its authority and violated the law.
“The President is devastating lives, dishonoring our values and departing from decades of precedent and law in his haste to destroy the lifeline of asylum in America,” Pelosi said in a statement.
While Democratic politicians have sought to portray the Trump policies as inhumane, the president’s supporters are certain to be pleased at another gesture making good on campaign promises to sharply curtail immigration.
Trump on Monday declared “very successful” what he had billed as a sweeping operation to arrest undocumented immigrants this past weekend. U.S. authorities launched small-scale operations aimed at about 2,000 recently arrived families in about 10 cities.

The operations come as the Trump administration faces criticism for housing immigrants in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions, and there are concerns about migrant children being separated from adults by U.S. authorities.
The administration says U.S. capacity to process asylum claims has been overwhelmed due to an influx of people from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador but also increasingly from Cuba and countries as far away as Africa and India.

Although the three Central American countries suffer from poverty, gang violence and domestic abuse, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said many asylum claims were “meritless.”
The administration chose a path just short of a “nuclear option, close to something like shutting down the border,” said Jessica Vaughan from the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports increased immigration restrictions.
“We don’t want to turn away people who are genuinely in danger but we know from experience that most of the people that are arriving at our border are not in that category. We have to find an effective way to deter frivolous or opportunist asylum-seekers,” Vaughan said.
Mexico has been somewhat cooperative with U.S. efforts to slow Central American immigration, in part under pressure from Trump threats to impose tariffs on Mexican products. But Mexico pushed back on Monday, saying asylum-seekers rejected by the United States should have to go back to their home countries, not Mexico.

Mexican Foreign Minister Marcel Ebrard said the new U.S. rule would not unilaterally convert Mexico into a designated “safe third country,” a status that would oblige asylum-seekers passing through its territory to seek refuge in Mexico, not the United States.
Guatemala, which both sends migrants to the United States and receives Hondurans and Salvadorans passing through, said on Sunday it would postpone President Jimmy Morales’ visit to Washington to discuss Guatemala’s potential designation as a “safe third country” for asylum seekers, stressing it had no plans to sign such an agreement.
Lawyers and rights activists say neither Mexico or Guatemala offer adequate conditions to provide safe harbor for many asylum-seekers, or strong enough institutions to process large numbers of asylum claims.
In January Trump required many asylum-seekers to wait out their cases in Mexico, known as the “Remain in Mexico” policy or the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), with nearly 20,000 people sent back so far. It was not immediately clear how the new rule would affect MPP."

According to a new rule published in the Federal Register, asylum seekers who pass through another country first will be ineligible for asylum at the U.S. southern border. The rule, expected to go into effect on Tuesday, also applies to children who have crossed the border alone. The new rule will affect asylum seekers coming through Mexico from countries like Guatemala and El Salvador.
There are some exceptions: If someone has been trafficked, if the country the migrant passed through did not sign one of the major international treaties that govern how refugees are managed (though most Western countries have signed them) or if an asylum-seeker sought protection in a country but was denied, then a migrant could still apply for U.S. asylum.

But the move by President Trump's administration was meant to essentially end asylum protections as they now are on the southern border. Mr. Trump has long vented his frustrations with the U.S. asylum system, insisting Democrats need to change the laws.
The policy is almost certain to face a legal challenge, and shortly after the new rule was announced, the American Civil Liberties Union said it intends to sue.
""The Trump administration is trying to unilaterally reverse our country's legal and moral commitment to protect those fleeing danger. This new rule is patently unlawful and we will sue swiftly,"" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project.
U.S. law allows refugees to request asylum when they arrive at the U.S. regardless of how they did so, but there is an exception for those who have come through a country considered to be ""safe."" But the Immigration and Nationality Act, which governs asylum law, is vague on how a country is determined ""safe""; it says ""pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement.""
""While the recent supplemental funding was absolutely vital to helping confront the crisis, the truth is that it will not be enough without targeted changes to the legal framework of our immigration system,"" Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said in a statement. ""Until Congress can act, this interim rule will help reduce a major 'pull' factor driving irregular migration to the United States and enable DHS and DOJ to more quickly and efficiently process cases originating from the southern border, leading to fewer individuals transiting through Mexico on a dangerous journey.""
The Mexican government says Mexican policy remains unchanged, and Mexico will not send people back to countries where they fear prosecution.
Attorney General William Barr insisted the new rule will ""decrease forum shopping by economic migrants and those who seek to exploit our asylum system to obtain entry to the United States—while ensuring that no one is removed from the United States who is more likely than not to be tortured or persecuted on account of a protected ground.""
Right now, the U.S. has such an agreement, known as a ""safe third country,"" only with Canada. Under a recent agreement with Mexico, Central American countries were considering a regional compact on the issue, but nothing has been decided. Guatemalan officials were expected in Washington on Monday, but apparently a meeting between Mr. Trump and Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales was canceled amid a court challenge in Guatemala over whether the country could agree to a safe third with the U.S.
The new rule also will apply to the initial asylum screening, known as a ""credible fear"" interview, at which migrants must prove they have credible fears of returning to their home country. It applies to migrants who are arriving to the U.S., not those who are already in the country.
Trump administration officials say the changes are meant to close the gap between the initial asylum screening that most people pass and the final decision on asylum that most people do not win. But immigrant rights groups, religious leaders and humanitarian groups have said the Republican administration's policies amount to a cruel and calloused effort to keep immigrants out of the country. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador are poor countries suffering from violence.
Along with the administration's recent effort to send asylum seekers back over the border, Mr. Trump has tried to deny asylum to anyone crossing the border illegally and restrict who can claim asylum, and Attorney General William Barr recently tried to keep thousands of asylum seekers detained while their cases play out.
Nearly all of those efforts have been blocked by courts.
Immigration courts are backlogged by more than 800,000 cases, meaning many people won't have their asylum claims heard for years, despite the fact that more judges are being hired.
People are generally eligible for asylum in the U.S. if they fear return to their home country because they have been persecuted or have a well-founded fear that they will be persecuted on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group.
During the budget year for 2009, there were 35,811 asylum claims, and 8,384 were granted. During 2018 budget year, there were 162,060 claims filed, and 13,168 were granted."

But the Immigration and Nationality Act, which governs asylum law, is vague on how a country is determined ""safe""; it says ""pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement.""
Right now, the U.S. has such an agreement, known as a ""safe third country,"" only with Canada. Under a recent agreement with Mexico, Central American countries were considering a regional compact on the issue, but nothing has been decided. Guatemalan officials were expected in Washington on Monday, but apparently a meeting between Trump and Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales was canceled amid a court challenge in Guatemala over whether the country could agree to a safe third with the U.S.
The new rule also will apply to the initial asylum screening, known as a ""credible fear"" interview, at which migrants must prove they have credible fears of returning to their home country. It applies to migrants who are arriving to the U.S., not those who are already in the country.
Trump administration officials say the changes are meant to close the gap between the initial asylum screening that most people pass and the final decision on asylum that most people do not win. But immigrant rights groups, religious leaders and humanitarian groups have said the Republican administration's policies amount to a cruel and calloused effort to keep immigrants out of the country. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador are poor countries suffering from violence .
Along with the administration's recent effort to send asylum seekers back over the border , Trump has tried to deny asylum to anyone crossing the border illegally and restrict who can claim asylum, and Attorney General William Barr recently tried to keep thousands of asylum seekers detained while their cases play out.
Nearly all of those efforts have been blocked by courts.
Meanwhile, conditions have worsened for migrants who make it over the border seeking better lives. Tens of thousands of Central American migrant families cross the border each month, many claiming asylum. The numbers have increased despite Trump's derisive rhetoric and hard-line immigration policies. Border facilities have been dangerously cramped and crowded well beyond capacity. The Department of Homeland Security's watchdog found fetid, filthy conditions for many children. And lawmakers who traveled there recently decried conditions .
Immigration courts are backlogged by more than 800,000 cases, meaning many people won't have their asylum claims heard for years despite move judges being hired.
People are generally eligible for asylum in the U.S. if they feared return to their home country because they would be persecuted based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group.
During the budget year for 2009, there were 35,811 asylum claims, and 8,384 were granted. During 2018 budget year, there were 162,060 claims filed, and 13,168 were granted.

Details of this weekend’s operations remain unknown, but the officials said that the orders include detention and deportations. One of the officials said ICE has been ordered to go after people “who received a final order of deportation from an immigration judge after..."
5319,"ICE raids are looming. Panicked immigrants are skipping work, hiding out and bracing for the worst'",CNN (Web News),7/12/2019,,,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/12/us/immigration-ice-raids-fear/index.html,"(CNN) Weeks ago, as President Donald Trump warned that ICE agents were preparing raids across the country , a 41-year-old housekeeper and babysitter in Miami headed to the grocery store with her daughter.
They knew they'd be staying inside and needed to stock up on supplies.
""I felt that day like it was a hurricane coming,"" the undocumented immigrant from Nicaragua told CNN.
Since then, the raids Trump threatened haven't happened . But for millions of undocumented immigrants living across the United States, the storm is still brewing.
With a new threat of immigration raids on Sunday , immigrant rights advocates and undocumented immigrants told CNN that fear in their communities is growing.
And undocumented immigrants are bracing themselves.
They're calling hotlines, afraid to go outside and unsure of where to turn. Some are staying home from work. Others are posting signs by doors inside their homes telling them what to do if ICE agents show up.
She woke up last night, screaming
While the uneasy mix of panic and preparation weeks ago felt like a hurricane, there was one notable difference for the housekeeper in Miami. The store in her neighborhood seemed eerily empty. Already, she said, people were afraid to go out.
She returned home with a plan.
""I said, 'OK, you know what, we're going to keep the windows down, the blinds down. I don't want any noise. I want everybody to stay calm and try to turn off the lights in the living room, so if they come, they don't know that we are in the house,'"" she said. ""I know my rights. I know that I don't have to open the door. I know a lot of things, but even with that it's really scary.""
The woman shared her story with CNN but asked to be identified only by a pseudonym, Elena, out of fear she could face repercussions for speaking out. She said she came to the United States more than two decades ago on a visa, which she overstayed as she sought asylum.
Elena lost her case but stayed in the United States, where she says she's built a life and grown her family. She's terrified of being separated from them.
""This is a horrible feeling,"" she said Thursday. ""These past two days, I've been waking up in the middle of the night. My husband says, 'What happened to you last night? You started screaming in your dream.'""
A man is detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on October 14, 2015, in Los Angeles, California.
Frightened farm workers are staying home
Élfido García sat in the scorching sun Thursday tending to agave plants in Homestead, Florida. For weeks, he's been picking up extra work to fill in for colleagues who he says are too scared to leave home after hearing about the possibility of raids on TV.
The migrant worker from Guatemala says he only leaves home to walk to work, knowing that along the way he risks the possibility of arrest by authorities.
""Yes, I'm taking the risk,"" he said, ""but just to fight for my family.""
As the threat of immigration raids looms in South Florida, fields once filled with workers look empty. Weeds are popping up where crops once grew. And the number of ""help wanted"" signs posted offering work are on the rise.
A growing number of workers are scared to leave their homes, leaving farm owners in search of laborers to harvest their crops.
Farm owner Gustavo Serna told CNN en Español that crops are being lost as a result.
""Because of the lack of workers, many times people are losing up to 50% of their harvest,"" he said.
Across the country, in Worthington, Minnesota, an undocumented agriculture worker who spoke with CNN said the community there is terrified, too. He said he's planning to hunker down all weekend until he is certain ICE agents aren't in the streets.
""I don't want to leave my family devastated,"" he said, ""so we are just going to stay inside.""
Élfido García says he's been hunkering down at home as reports of possible immigration raids resurface. He only leaves to walk to work.
Questions and frantic calls
Advocates note that fears of deportation are familiar in immigrant communities across the country. And this isn't the first time raids have been threatened or reported on before they occur.
But this time around, many advocates say the concerns they're hearing from immigrants are more intense.
""There is a lot of panic and a lot of fear, even though we know that these raids happen every year. ... Something feels tangibly different this time around,"" said Nayim Islam, an immigrant rights organizer for Desis Rising Up & Moving, an advocacy group that works with South Asian and Indo-Caribbean communities in New York City.
Many groups have set up hotlines for community members to report raids and reach out for help.
""We got a call from a mom who said that her little girl wasn't feeling well and she was afraid to go to the doctor. She was trying to figure out how to make it there,"" said Melissa Taveras, a spokeswoman for the Florida Immigrant Coalition.
""We keep getting calls and messages from folks, saying, 'We're scared. What should we do?'"" Taveras said. ""I've seen those sorts of messages and calls more than usual, which really worries me, because those are people that are preparing in fear.""
Across the country, advocacy groups have been hosting ""Know Your Rights"" trainings and circulating fliers and social medial posts with guidelines about what they say immigrants should do if ICE agents show up at their door.
The word seems to have gotten out, said Abel Nuñez, executive director of the Central American Resource Center in Washington.
""A lot of people have heard that message,"" he said. ""I think the question is, if it does happen to them, are they going to implement it? It's one thing for me to give you a card or a paper with your rights. It's another thing at five in the morning, when you hear a loud knock at your door and someone's yelling, ' Police!' Are you going to let them in? That's a very different environment.
""At this point, it's just about repetition, reminding them of what they have, so that it's muscle memory.""
'This is not a life'
Now that another ICE operation appears to be imminent, Elena says she doesn't want to risk staying home to find out what would happen if federal agents show up at her door.
""This week we're planning to move out for a week until this stops, but next month we're going to move from the apartment,"" she said. ""I've been in that apartment for five years now, so I don't think it's secure.""
Fear, she says, has become a constant. She's so exhausted that sometimes she wishes she could go back to Nicaragua.
But she says recent unrest there has made her scared to return to the country she left decades ago.
""Sometimes I feel that way. I want to say...'I give up. I'm going back.' Because this is not a life. ... I'm driving. I have no driver's license.
""My daughter sometimes says, 'Mom, I'm scared you're not going to come back home,'"" Elena says. ""I don't know if I'm going to get the opportunity to feel that I have a free life, that I live in peace."""
6436,Why those ICE raids are being announced in advance',Fox News (Online),7/12/2019,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/why-those-ice-raids-are-being-announced-in-advance,"Starting Sunday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is expected to resume its previously announced plan to apprehend thousands of illegal immigrants across the country.
The reinvigorated effort comes just weeks after President Trump tweeted that ICE was preparing to kick off days of raids in at least 10 major cities. The operation was halted, however, the day before it was set to start, to give Congress time to arrive at a legislative solution on immigration. Trump said his administration would relaunch the raids after a two-week window – after the Independence Day observance – and that time now seems to have arrived.
So why are the raids being publicized days in advance?
“It’s unprecedented. But there is a political purpose behind it,” Thomas Kilbride, a retired Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agent and ICE policy adviser, told Fox News. He said the president has tried to get Democrats to come to the table because asylum laws need to change, and this is a way to bargain.
WAR CRIMINALS AMONG US: INSIDE THE QUIET EFFORT TO PROSECUTE AND DEPORT VIOLATORS DISGUISED AS REFUGEES
ICE agents are expected to target a minimum of 2,000 immigrants who have already been listed for deportation, but Kilbride said there will be “collateral” fallout.
What does that mean, though? While there are roughly a million people in the United States with removal orders, according to officials, those with criminal histories are the ones being sought. If other illegals are located along with a person of interest, they, too, will be arrested as part of that fallout.
But whether any political ambitions connected to the operation will prove successful remains to be seen.
“At a minimum, the asylum laws need to change, for people to have to remain outside the country when applying for asylum or applying at a foreign embassy,” Kilbride said. “What we are seeing at the border now is unprecedented.”
Other experts have underscored that Trump’s announcements are something of a gesture – and not something that the administration was under any legal obligation to do.
“The main point here is that the Trump administration is trying to circumvent some of the blowback from the other side of the aisle. It sends the message that these people have been notified to self-deport and if they fail to do that, this might happen,” said Steve Bucci, homeland security expert at the Heritage Foundation. “It is saying that we aren’t monsters, what we are doing is in accordance with the law and in a reasonable fashion.
""Past administrations didn’t announce raids because they didn’t have to, they just did them.”
Yet the heads-up also means that many may have left the addresses known to DHS in the weeks since the raids were first trumpeted, further hindering their effectiveness.
“Some may go into hiding or to a church providing a sanctuary,” Bucci continued.
Erin Corcoran, an immigration expert and executive director of Notre Dame's Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, affirmed that in the past, raids were not announced beforehand by immigration enforcement, just as they are not announced when law enforcement is involved; when the information is exposed, it can more often than not prove detrimental to an operation.
“Sometimes there have been leaks by individuals, but it has never been a policy choice to pre-emptively announce raids. It compromises the effectiveness of the raids. Those being targeted may relocate or refuse to answer the door when immigration officials knock because they are anticipating the raids,” she said. “Raids have been conducted by other administrations, oftentimes targeting certain types of immigration violations, including those with criminal convictions. However, there has not been an immigration raid by previous administrations targeting families or children.
""It is unclear why this administration is preemptively announcing these raids. I also think there is some disagreement within the administration officials about these raids.""
VENEZUELA’S WAR ON CHILDREN AT 'BREAKING POINT' OVER LACK OF MEDICAL CARE
The public announcement of the forthcoming raids has inspired a number of hashtag campaigns, from #protecteachother to #knowyourights, aimed at giving undocumented migrants information about civil liberties that include the rights to silence and an attorney.
Acting Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli said this week that the raids were “absolutely going to happen,” though he did not give an exact date for when “operational elements will roll out.”
Matthew Bourke, a spokesperson for ICE, told reporters Wednesday that his agency ""prioritizes the arrest and removal of unlawfully present aliens who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security” but he also declined to comment on specific details, citing “law enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security"" of ICE personnel.
In fact, some officials have expressed concern that declaring the missions publicly is a serious concern where officer safety is involved.

At the same time, however, some lawmakers and legal experts speculate that the leak of information from within could also be designed to have the raids halted once again.
Immigration lawyer Saman Nasseri, who's based in San Diego, contended that releasing information about the raids in advance is problematic not only for security reasons, but because of how often people move on, complicating the tracking of targets. He anticipates that the “operation will most likely be delayed again.”
The notion of immigration reform is set to be at the forefront of Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign and has long been a staple of his presidential agenda. While the migrant flow has shown signs of slowing over the past month, the Trump team has long grappled with the issue of large numbers of immigrants – mostly from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador – crossing the southern border with Mexico. More than 330,000 families have entered the U.S. illegally since the beginning of October, government records show.
DHS did not respond to a request for further comment."

FILE PHOTO: Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador deliver a speech to supporters in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico June 22, 2019. Press Office Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador/Handout via REUTERS
Speaking at his daily press conference, Lopez Obrador said he expected an agreement with factories to be signed next week.
“This agreement is going to be signed, there will be no legal problem,” he said. “We are arranging this so that they can be hired without much processing.”
Mexico’s border states have been inundated with migrants who must often wait weeks to seek U.S. asylum under a policy known as “metering,” which limits the number who can apply each day. After requesting asylum, thousands have been sent back to Mexico while they wait for their cases to be settled, a process that can take months or years.
The bottleneck shows no signs of easing. Mexico pledged earlier this month to do more to halt the flow of migrants to the United States after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to slap tariffs on Mexican exports.
Factories in northern Mexico have grappled with labor shortages, so migrants could prove a boon for employers.
Although Lopez Obrador has doubled the minimum wage along the U.S. border, pay there remains lower than the minimum wage in Central American countries such as Guatemala and Honduras, from which many of the migrants are fleeing.
What’s more, many migrants lack authorization to work in the country, and border cities including Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez have struggled to house them in shelters as their numbers swell.
Lopez Obrador added that plans were underway to build shelters and provide additional resources to the overtaxed facilities already in operation.
“Funds are being authorized so there will be resources in the shelters, so they do not lack food, medicine, medical attention,” he said.
Lopez Obrador also expressed a desire to guarantee work and shelter for migrants in southern Mexico.
Immigration centers in the region have become increasingly overcrowded as Mexican officials ramp up the detention of migrants headed for the northern border."

“This agreement is going to be signed, there will be no legal problem,” he said Friday. “We are arranging this so that they can be hired without much processing.”
Such a deal would provide a solution to some of the tens of thousands of migrants who are seeking asylum in the U.S. but have been sent back into Mexico as they await court dates on their asylum claims.
Finding a solution to securing the U.S.-Mexico border and dealing illegal immigration remains a hot topic in the U.S. Mexico promised to curb illegal immigration into the U.S. after President Trump threatened to slap tariffs on the country if they did not stop the surge."

The vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, a labor union that represents border agents, also pushed back during an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday.
“It’s disgusting to compare concentration camps to what the men and women are doing here protecting our country,” Art Del Cueto said on “America’s Newsroom.”
Ocasio-Cortez doubled down in the face of criticism, tweeting that the Trump administration has established “concentration camps” where immigrants are “being brutalized with dehumanizing conditions and dying.”
“And for the shrieking Republicans who don’t know the difference: concentration camps are not the same as death camps. Concentration camps are considered by experts as ‘the mass detention of civilians without trial.’ And that’s exactly what this administration is doing,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote, pointing to an Esquire article quoting historians who said the U.S. detention facilities at the southern border meet the definition of a concentration camp.

The back-and-forth comes as lawmakers consider Trump’s request for $4.5 billion in emergency funds to help deal with the flow of migrants at the southern border. Trump’s request includes $3.3 billion for humanitarian aid to help with care for unaccompanied minors and families crossing the border, as well as $1.1 billion for other operations like increasing the number of detention beds.

Republicans and the White House have used the remarks to nakedly cast Democrats as an enemy of Israel and American Jews, who in presidential elections have largely voted for Democratic candidates, according to exit polls. Democrats are likely to face questions about whether they agree with Ocasio-Cortez’s comments about concentration camps and the Trump administration’s detention centers as they return to Washington this week.

3000,Trump defends deal with Mexico that critics say will do little to curb migrant crisis',Washington Post,6/10/2019,,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-defends-deal-with-mexico-that-critics-say-will-do-little-to-curb-migrant-crisis/2019/06/09/0fd7d12e-8ada-11e9-8f69-a2795fca3343_story.html,"Whether the deal will greatly reduce the number of migrants entering the United States remains to be seen. But it nonetheless represents a serious effort by Mexico to do more on an issue central to Trump’s reelection campaign after he threatened to impose a 5 percent across-the-board tariff on one of the United States’ top trading partners.

Mexico announced Friday night that it would implement “strong measures” to reduce the flow of migrants across its territory toward the southern U.S. border, including the unprecedented deployment of thousands of Mexican national guard troops. It also agreed to expand a program allowing Central American migrants to stay in Mexico while they await the adjudication of their asylum claims.
“The president put a charge in his whole dialogue with Mexico with the tariff threats, brought them to the table,” Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said in an interview on “Fox News Sunday.” “The foreign minister of Mexico arrived within hours. He arrived the next day with real proposals on the table. This is the first time we’ve heard anything like this kind of number of law enforcement being deployed in Mexico to address migrations.”
With arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border soaring and Trump lashing out — at Democrats, foreign governments and U.S. laws — Homeland Security officials are under enormous pressure to halt the migration boom. The Trump administration’s efforts to deter migration have not worked, either being shot down in the courts or failing to get through Congress. And Mexican officials brushed off some of the president’s earlier demands.
AD
AD
Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on Mexico to gain leverage in immigration negotiations drew criticism from lawmakers in both parties, who called it a dangerous escalation that could damage the U.S. economy.
But in some morning tweets, Trump said that Mexico “was not being cooperative on the Border” before the deal reached Friday. Now, he said, “I have full confidence, especially after speaking to their President yesterday, that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done.”
Trump said he could move to reimpose tariffs if Mexico doesn’t follow through on its promises. Some aspects of the deal, he added, remain to be announced — “one in particular,” he said, “will be announced at the appropriate time.”
AD
In a tweet Monday morning, Trump said the change would require “a vote by Mexico’s Legislative body!”
AD
“We do not anticipate a problem with the vote but, if for any reason the approval is not forthcoming, Tariffs will be reinstated!” he said.
The president’s tweets seemed to hint at a possible component of the deal that would transform asylum rules across the region and make applicants seek refuge in the first country they reach. Such an accord would allow the United States to deport most asylum seekers from Guatemala to Mexico, and those from Honduras and El Salvador would be flown to Guatemala.
Homeland Security officials think such an arrangement would lead to a dramatic drop in migrants arriving each month at the U.S. border. Those migrants are generally released from custody if they have a child with them.
AD
Democrats criticized the agreement as more evidence of the president’s anti-immigration agenda while questioning how much impact it would have.
AD
“These are agreements that Mexico had already made, in some cases months ago,” former congressman Beto O’Rourke, who is running for president, said in an interview on ABC’s “This Week.” “They might have accelerated the timetable, but by and large the president achieved nothing except to jeopardize the most important trading relationship that the United States of America has.”
Immigrant rights advocates argued Sunday that while it was important that the United States and Mexico pledged to invest resources in Central America, the deal fails to address the root cause of the problem, which is poverty and violence in the region that the migrants are fleeing.
AD
“In general, I don’t think that this agreement stems the flow,” Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, said in an interview. “The situation in Central America is pretty dire. There are no examples in modern history of us being able to enforce our way out of a migration crisis like this.”

But those who support a harder line on immigration said the agreement was a positive sign.
“I think Mexico sees that our two countries have a shared interest in clamping down on this,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors restricted immigration. “We’ll see in a couple of months whether it makes a difference, but I think it can. I’m cautiously optimistic.”

Homeland Security officials say the deal, if fully implemented, represents a breakthrough in their pressure campaign to get Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to take a more robust enforcement approach.
In particular, the pledge to deploy 6,000 national guard forces in southern Mexico could make it more difficult for smugglers to continue transporting groups of Central American migrants on buses with little interference from authorities.
AD
Mexico has also given assurances it will expand immigration detention centers and bolster deportation efforts.
The newly formed national guard was created by López Obrador primarily in response to domestic pressure to reduce crime and Mexico’s soaring homicide rate, so committing those forces to immigration enforcement — which López Obrador described last year during his campaign as doing “dirty work” for the United States — amounts to a significant concession, and has generated criticism.
AD
Mexico had already promised to use the national guard, but the deployment size is much larger than what the government had offered previously.
U.S. officials also view the full expansion of the MPP program, known informally as “Remain in Mexico,” as a difference-maker, allowing them to potentially require thousands more asylum seekers to wait outside U.S. territory while their claims for protection are fully adjudicated, a process that can take years. Mexico to date has been resisting U.S. efforts to expand the program across the entire border.
AD
The MPP program has so far survived court challenges, but a panel of federal judges in California has raised doubts about its legality, and Homeland Security officials have been bracing for an injunction that could halt the program.
AD
For U.S. officials, the question is whether the agreement will bring the rapid reduction in unauthorized border crossings that Trump is demanding, and whether it will be sustained once the president’s threats abate.
Over the weekend, the deal prompted congressional Republicans to call for action on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Trump’s new North American trade deal, which has yet to be approved by Congress.
Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a Senate Finance Committee member and former U.S. trade representative, said in a statement Friday that he hoped the migration accord would “pave the way for the House and Senate to move quickly to pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.”
AD
The White House took a step this month to begin the process of congressional approval, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) warned as recently as Wednesday that approval was in doubt in the House unless several concerns about the negotiated agreement are addressed.
“We hope to have a path to yes to get it done,” she told reporters. “But you have to have enforcement as part of the agreement, not as part of a sidebar letter or bills that we might pass in each country — part of the agreement.”
A senior Democratic aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal conversations, said Sunday that the migration deal was “totally irrelevant” to leaders’ concerns about the USMCA.
Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, appeared relieved in talk-show appearances Sunday.
Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who had spoken out against Trump’s tariff threats, called the deal “a big win for both sides” and said it sent a message to China, whose leaders are wrangling with Trump over trade.
“Even though I’m not a big supporter of tariffs, he is, and his willingness to use that probably helped produce a result,” Blunt said on “Face the Nation.” “I hope we don’t have to go back to that as an issue again with Mexico.”
With an apparently successful outcome in hand, Trump still couldn’t avoid overselling the deal. In a tweet Saturday morning, the president claimed that Mexico had agreed to “IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!”
But Mexico’s ambassador to the United States, Martha Bárcena, declined to confirm that account. In an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” she said only that agricultural trade “is going to grow without tariffs and with USMCA ratification.”
“But there was no transaction that was signed off on as part of this deal, is what I understand you’re saying,” host Margaret Brennan asked. “You’re just talking about trade.”
Bárcena nodded a few times before answering. “I’m talking about trade, and I am absolutely certain that the trade in agricultural goods would increase dramatically in the next few months,” she said.
Later, in a tweet, Bárcena maintained that she “did not contradict” Trump on the issue — underscoring Mexican officials’ hesitance to appear critical of the president so soon after avoiding a major trade war."
4429,White House Touts Mexico Immigration Deal and Claims More to Come',CBN,6/10/2019,,,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/june/white-house-touts-mexico-immigration-deal-and-claims-more-to-come,"WASHINGTON – The White House's plan to impose a five percent tax on Mexican goods came to a halt Friday as the administration and Mexican officials reached an agreement to curb illegal immigration.
The president is taking a victory lap over what he sees as successful negotiations and saying more is on the way.
We have fully signed and documented another very important part of the Immigration and Security deal with Mexico, one that the U.S. has been asking about getting for many years. It will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by Mexico’s Legislative body!.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 10, 2019
""We have fully signed and documented another very important part of the Immigration and Security Deal with Mexico… it will be revealed in the not too distant future,"" Trump tweeted Monday.
His critics say when it comes to Friday's agreement, there's nothing new.
But DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan defended it on Fox News Sunday saying, ""All of it is new.""
The administration took the airwaves and Twitter to push back on a New York Times report which said most of the agreement had been negotiated months ago.
""The president put a charge in this whole dialogue with Mexico with the tariff threat,"" McAleenan said.
""This is the first time we've heard anything like this kind of number of law enforcement being deployed to Mexico to address migration,"" he continued.
According to the Joint Declaration released by the State Department, 6,000 Mexican National Guard members are heading to the Guatemalan border and throughout the country. Mexico has agreed to take decisive action to dismantle human trafficking organizations and both sides agree to the expansion of the migrant protection protocols.
Trump's supporters in Washington say the very threat of tariffs succeeded in pressuring the Mexican government to take stronger actions.
""He's using tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations and I think he used them as leverage in this situation brilliantly,"" said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI).
Trump's opponents contend the end doesn't justify the means.
""They might have accelerated the timetable. But by and large, the president achieved nothing except to jeopardize the most important trading relationship that the United States of America has,"" presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke told ABC's ""This Week.""
""What I am tired of is a president who consistently goes to war, verbal war, with our allies,"" added presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union.""
There's one thing both sides agree on: More work has to be done by Congress. The controversy stems over the what and the how."
5828,Trump defends Mexico migration deal and pledges more detail',Reuters,6/10/2019,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-mexico/trump-defends-mexico-migration-deal-and-pledges-more-detail-idUSKCN1TA0GM,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump defended his administration’s deal with Mexico against criticism that there were no major new commitments to stem a flow of Central American migrants crossing into the United States, and said on Sunday more details would soon be released.
Key aspects of the agreement are still unclear, including whether Mexico has pledged to buy more U.S. agricultural products and if the deal materially expanded a previous commitment by Mexico to more vigorously police its southern border with Guatemala.
Top Democratic senators said many aspects of the deal were not new, while the Mexican ambassador to the United States declined to confirm whether it contained any commitments on agricultural goods.
The deal, announced on Friday after three days of talks in Washington, averted Trump’s threatened imposition of 5% import tariffs on all Mexican goods that had been due to start on Monday unless Mexico committed to do more to help reduce an increase in migrants arriving at the U.S. southern border.
“Mexico was not being cooperative on the Border...and now I have full confidence, especially after speaking to their President yesterday, that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done,” Trump said on Twitter.
“Importantly, some things not mentioned in yesterday press release, one in particular, were agreed upon. That will be announced at the appropriate time,” he added.
Trump did not elaborate and the White House and State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Friday’s joint communique broadly sketched the terms of the agreement, but contained few details.
The Mexican peso jumped against the dollar in Asian markets and U.S. equity futures rose on Sunday following the deal.
The agreement expedites a program known as the Migration Protection Protocols that was announced in December. That program sends migrants seeking asylum in the United States to wait in Mexico while their cases are being processed.
Friday’s agreement would see the United States immediately expand the implementation of the MPP across its entire 2,000-mile (3,220-km) southern border, the State Department said on Friday.
But as of Sunday night, U.S.-bound asylum seekers were not yet being sent back to additional Mexican border towns, three Mexican officials said.
Officials in the Mexican border states of Sonora, south of the U.S. states of Arizona and New Mexico, and Tamaulipas, south of Texas, said they were unaware of plans to expand the number of border crossings where the asylum seekers must be returned to Mexican territory to await processing.
The deal will also see Mexico deploy the National Guard police force to its southern border, where many Central American migrants enter Mexico.
UNCERTAINTY OVER AGRICULTURE
On Saturday, a New York Times report, citing officials from both countries familiar with the negotiations, said most of Friday’s deal had already been sketched out in March, when Mexico agreed to deploy its National Guard throughout the country, with priority given to the southern border.
Trump tweeted on Sunday that the Times report was false, adding: “We have been trying to get some of these Border Actions for a long time, as have other administrations, but were not able to get them, or get them in full, until our signed agreement with Mexico.”
But it was business as usual over the weekend at the busiest crossing point along Mexico’s porous southern border with Guatemala. Evidence of Mexico’s promised crackdown on new arrivals trying to reach the United States was nowhere to be seen, as a small fleet of rafts carried migrants hoping to escape the violence of Central America.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer also said there appeared to be little new in the deal, adding it was a “bogus” solution used by Trump to get out of an ill-conceived tariff threat.
“This is likely to have only a small impact on solving the root causes of Central American migration because many of the components are things Mexico had already said they would do,” Schumer said on Twitter.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Twitter, however, that Trump’s “strong stand got Mexico to do things they have never done before.”
There is further uncertainty around Trump’s comments on Saturday that Mexico had agreed to “immediately begin” buying “large quantities” of agricultural goods from U.S. farmers.

Mexican officials have not confirmed any new agreement on agricultural products. Asked repeatedly about such a deal on CBS on Sunday, the Mexican ambassador to the United States, Martha Bárcena Coqui, said only that trade would increase without the tariffs. She said there were many details discussed during negotiations that were not in the written declaration.
She noted Mexico was already a top U.S. trade partner in agricultural products. Mexico is the top importer of U.S. corn, wheat, pork and dairy by volume.
On Saturday, Mexico’s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, tweeted that the deal should boost economic growth and therefore demand for U.S. agricultural products, but he also stopped short of saying that the deal contained a commitment on Mexico’s part to purchase more goods from the United States."
4140,"Mexico blocks 1,000-migrant caravan ahead of Trump's tariff deadline""",Washington Examiner,6/6/2019,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mexico-blocks-1-000-migrant-caravan-ahead-of-trumps-tariff-deadline,"Mexico apprehended about 1,000 migrants after President Trump threatened to slap tariffs on the country over its lax border policies.
About 200 Mexican military police intercepted the caravan walking north along a highway in southern Mexico on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. The migrants told officers they planned to travel to the U.S. and claim asylum.
Some migrants resisted and others fled into the forest on either side of the highway, but the vast majority of those in the caravan complied with orders from Mexican officials. Hundreds of migrants agreed to go to a migrant detention center.
At the detention center, the migrants will be processed and, if needed, be transported back to their home countries.
The mass arrest comes days before Trump plans to place 5% tariff on all Mexican imports. Last week, Trump threatened Mexico with tariffs starting at 5% on June 10 and increasing 5% each month up to 25% until Mexico restricts the flow of migrants traveling through it to the U.S.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is answering Trump’s call for stricter border security. López Obrador has sent a delegation to meet with White House officials and appears to be tightening border enforcement. López Obrador said Thursday he expected a deal to be reached by the end of the day.

MEXICO CITY — Mexican soldiers, armed police and migration officials blocked hundreds of migrants after they crossed the border from Guatemala in a caravan into southern Mexico on Wednesday, and detained dozens of them, a witness from a migrant aid group and an official said.
The Mexican response in the border town of Metapa, which included dozens of soldiers, marked a toughening of the government's efforts to curb the flow of mainly Central American migrants, said Salva Cruz, a coordinator with Fray Matias de Cordova.
""That many sailors and military police, yes, it's new,"" Cruz said, by WhatsApp, from Metapa, in the southern border state of Chiapas, where the vast majority of migrants from Central America cross into Mexico. Many are asylum seekers fleeing violence and poverty in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The operation in Chiapas coincided with a meeting of Mexican and U.S. officials at the White House on Wednesday to thrash out a deal that would avoid blanket tariffs on Mexico threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump last week.
Trump announced the tariffs in retaliation for what he called Mexico's failure to stop Central American migrants from reaching the U.S. border.

Mexico's National Migration Institute (INM) said in a statement that a group of about 300 people entered Mexico by a border bridge Wednesday morning, and another 120 people joined the group as they walked to the city of Tapachula.
The migrants later agreed to be taken by bus to a migration office to be processed, the INM said.
U.S. border officers apprehended more than 132,000 people crossing from Mexico in May, a third more than in April and the highest monthly level since 2006, reaching what U.S. officials said on Wednesday were ""crisis"" levels.
An INM official in Mexico City who was unauthorized to talk to the media said, on condition of anonymity, that the migrants were being asked to show their status in Mexico.
Migration officials detained 350 to 400 people, the official said, noting that federal police and agents from the National Guard were present. Mexico's government recently created a militarized police force called the National Guard made up of soldiers and federal police.
On Wednesday afternoon in Mexico City, police detained Irineo Mujica, director of the U.S.-Mexico migrant aid group Pueblo Sin Fronteras, and Cristobal Sanchez, a migrant rights activist, according to Alex Mensing, a coordinator with the group.
Pueblo Sin Fronteras has for several years guided annual caravans through Mexico, seeking to protect migrants and to advocate for their rights along a 2,000-mile trail ridden with criminals and corrupt officials who prey on lone travelers through kidnapping, extortion and other forms of assault.
Since April 2018 Trump has lashed out at the caravans of Central Americans wending their way to the United States, while blaming Mexico for failing to stop their movement to the U.S. border.

2859,Second federal appeals court rules against Trump administration over DACA rollback',Washington Examiner,5/17/2019,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/second-federal-appeals-court-rules-against-trump-administration-over-daca-rollback,"A second federal appeals court on Friday ruled against the Trump administration in its attempt to roll back the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and said its decision to do so was unlawful.
A divided three-judge panel on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in its ruling that the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to rescind the DACA program violated federal law because “it was not adequately explained and thus was arbitrary and capricious.”
The Richmond-based federal appeals court is the second appeals court to rule against President Trump in his attempt to wind down the DACA program, which was implemented by the Obama administration in 2012 and protected immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children from the threat of deportation.
In November, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court order blocking the government from rescinding the DACA program. The San Francisco-based court said then that plaintiffs in that challenge to the administration’s efforts to end DACA were likely to succeed in their claim that the rescission “is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”
The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to take up the dispute over its attempted rollback, though the court has not acted on numerous petitions currently before it.
The Trump administration announced in 2017 that it would be ending the DACA program, and the Department of Homeland Security predicated its decision on the grounds DACA was unlawful to begin with.
But the president’s move was met with a host of lawsuits filed by immigrant-rights groups and individuals who argued DACA’s wind down violated federal law and the Constitution.
Federal district court judges in Washington, D.C., New York, and San Francisco delivered losses to the Trump administration and blocked it from moving forward with DACA’s rollback. But one judge in Greenbelt, Md., sided with the Trump administration and said the president acted within his authority to wind down the Obama-era program.
The 4th Circuit, however, reversed the ruling from the federal judge in Maryland that upheld DACA's rescission.
In its ruling against the Trump administration, the 4th Circuit said the Department of Homeland Security failed to account for those affected by the decision.
“Hundreds of thousands of people had structured their lives on the availability of deferred action during the over five years between implementation of DACA and the decision to rescind it,” the court said. “Although the government insists that Acting Secretary [Elaine] Duke considered these interests in connection with her decision to rescind DACA, her memo makes no mention of them.”
Judge Julius Richardson, a Trump appointee, dissented and said the executive branch's rollback of DACA is judicially unreviewable.
""We in the judicial branch have a narrowly circumscribed role. It is not our place to second-guess the wisdom of the discretionary decisions made by the other branches,"" Richardson wrote. ""The rescission of DACA was a controversial and contentious decision, but one that was committed to the executive branch.""

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — A federal appeals court ruled Friday the Trump administration acted in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner when it sought to end an Obama-era program that shields young immigrants from deportation.
A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2 to 1 that the Trump administration violated federal law when it tried to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program without adequately explaining why. The ruling overturns a lower court ruling a judge in Maryland made last year, which Trump had previously praised via Twitter.
Friday’s ruling will not have any immediate effect as other federal courts have already ordered that DACA be kept in place.
ADVERTISEMENT
The 4th Circuit ruling said the Department of Homeland Security did not “adequately account” for how ending DACA program would affect the hundreds of thousands of young people who “structured their lives” around the program.
“We recognize the struggle is not over and there are more battles to fight in the Supreme Court on this road to justice, but our families are emboldened by knowing that they are on the right side of history,” said Gustavo Torres, executive director of Casa de Maryland, the lead plaintiff in the case.
Trump and his Justice Department have argued that the Obama administration acted unlawfully when it implemented DACA. The Justice Department declined to comment.
Preserving DACA is a top Democratic priority, but discussions between Trump and Democrats on the issue have gone nowhere.
Trump’s latest immigration plan, unveiled Thursday, does not address what to do about the hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters that “every single time that we have put forward or anyone else has put forward any type of immigration plan that has included DACA it’s failed.”
DACA’s fate could be decided by the Supreme Court, which is weighing the Trump administration’s appeals of other federal court rulings.
The justices have set no date to take action.
If the high court decides it wants to hear the appeals, arguments would not take place before the fall. That means a decision is not expected until 2020, which could come in the thick of next year’s presidential contest.

3935,"Trump Signals Even Fiercer Immigration Agenda, With a Possible Return of Family Separations'",New York Times (Online News),4/9/2019,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/us/politics/trump-asylum-seekers-federal-judge.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s purge of the nation’s top homeland security officials is a sign that he is preparing to unleash an even fiercer assault on immigration, including a possible return of his controversial decision last summer to separate migrant children from their parents, current and former administration officials said Monday.
Mr. Trump shook up the ranks of his top immigration officials after spending months demanding that they take tougher action to stop the surge in migrant families at the border and seething about what he considers their overly legalistic refusals to do what he has said was necessary.
That anger was underscored on Monday when a judge blocked Mr. Trump’s efforts to force asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases proceed — a practice that immigration advocates called inhumane and illegal. Judge Richard Seeborg of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that existing law did not give Mr. Trump the power to enforce the policy, known as “migrant protection protocols.”
The immediate targets of the president’s growing fury about the situation at the border were the officials who he saw as insufficiently steely minded: Kirstjen Nielsen, who resigned Sunday as the secretary of homeland security, and Ron Vitiello, whose nomination to permanently lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement was pulled after Mr. Trump remarked that “we want to go in a tougher direction.”"
4029,"Trump says no plan to revive family separations, blames Obama for uproar'",Fox News (Online),4/9/2019,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-no-plan-to-revive-family-separations-blames-obama-for-uproar,"President Trump said Tuesday that the administration has no plans to revive the controversial policy that allowed for family separations at the border, amid renewed speculation about whether the practice could return amid the shakeup at the Homeland Security department.
“We’re not looking to do that,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday prior to a closed-door meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN MAKES FIRST PUBLIC COMMENTS SINCE RESIGNATION AS DHS BOSS
He added that “once you don’t have it, many more people are coming, like a picnic. Like Disney Land.”
But he said, “We’re not looking to do it.”
The president ended the practice under pressure and mounting criticism last year.
But the issue of family separations has emerged once again after DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation and other changes in the department. The president also withdrew the nomination of acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Ron Vitellio to become the permanent head of the agency, telling reporters that “Ron’s a good man, but we’re going in a tougher direction, we want to go in a tougher direction.”
Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, though, Trump sought to pin the blame on his predecessor for the uproar.
“Obama separated the children, just so you understand. President Obama separated the children,” Trump said. “The cages that were shown, very inappropriate, they were built by President Obama and the Obama administration –not by Trump.”
“The press knows it, you know it, we all know it,” he said. “I’m the one that stopped it.”
Initial images of cages with children inside that spread on social media last year indeed were from the Obama administration. The photos, taken in 2014 by The Associated Press, were wrongly described as illustrating imprisonment under the Trump administration.
But while some family separations may have happened under Obama, it was not nearly as widespread as it was during the Trump administration, amid a “zero tolerance” policy that led to the separations.
Neither the Obama administration nor the Trump administration had an explicit family separation policy, but the “zero tolerance” policy meant that anyone caught crossing the border illegally was to be criminally prosecuted, even if they had few or no previous convictions. Under that policy, adults were taken to court for criminal proceedings, while their children were separated from them. If the charges took longer than 72 hours to process, children would be sent from the care of Customs and Border Protection to the Health and Human Services Department.
SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR TO STEP DOWN, ON HEELS OF NIELSEN RESIGNATION
Last June, Trump signed an executive order that stopped family separations.
Trump also slammed congressional Democrats Tuesday for not doing enough to ""act"" on border security.
""Homeland security is what we want--there's no better term, there's no better name,"" Trump said. ""We want homeland security and that’s what we’re gonna get.""

3710,Judge blocks Trump policy forcing asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico',USA TODAY,4/8/2019,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/08/judge-blocks-trump-policy-forcing-asylum-seekers-wait-mexico/3244127002/,"A federal judge on Monday blocked the Trump administration's policy requiring Central American asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases are decided in the U.S., ruling that Department of Homeland Security overstepped its legal authority.
That policy was one of the last attempts by outgoing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to gain control of the southern border, which has seen such an increase in illegal crossings that she resigned from her post over the weekend.
U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco ordered the Trump administration to allow the plaintiffs in the case — 11 migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras — to enter the U.S. within two days. He issued a nationwide preliminary injunction that prevents the administration from forcing future asylum-seekers back into Mexico. The order goes into effect on Friday.
Seeborg, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, ruled that the Trump policy was not properly implemented and violated both U.S. laws and the 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees, which the U.S. is a party to. The asylum-seekers, Seeborg ruled, were already fleeing dangerous conditions in their home countries, only to be returned to Mexican border towns ""where they face undue risk to their lives and freedom.""
Trump complained of Seeborg's ruling Monday night on Twitter: ""A 9th Circuit Judge just ruled that Mexico is too dangerous for migrants. So unfair to the U.S. OUT OF CONTROL!"" he said.
The ruling marks the third straight time the Trump administration has been shot down in its attempts to limit or halt asylum-seekers who have been arriving at the U.S. border in record numbers.
""Try as it may, the Trump administration cannot simply ignore our laws in order to accomplish its goal of preventing people from seeking asylum in the United States,"" said Judy Rabinovitz, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project who argued the case.
In December, another federal judge struck down the Department of Justice's attempt to cut off asylum for victims of domestic abuse and gang violence. In November, another federal judge struck down Justice's attempts to cut off asylum for people who crossed into the country illegally, which is allowed under U.S. law.
In that case, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar wrote that Trump ""may not rewrite the immigration laws.""
Monday's ruling follows a suit filed by Central American migrants who were among the first to be returned to Tijuana after requesting asylum at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in southern California, and several humanitarian groups that have been assisting migrants.
The policy, officially called the ""Migrant Protection Protocols"" but informally referred to as the ""Remain in Mexico"" plan, started in January at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in southern California. The policy has expanded to the Calexico Port of Entry about 120 miles east of San Ysidro, and Homeland Security officials say the plan is to gradually roll it out to all other ports along the U.S.-Mexico border.
It allows migrants from countries other than Mexico to request asylum at U.S ports of entry, but then requires them to return to Mexico to wait for a decision. Previously, asylum seekers were released into the U.S. and given a notice to appear in immigration court to proceed with their case.

The U.S. and Mexican governments had been negotiating a joint plan, where Mexico would assume responsibility of the waiting asylum applicants, but when those talks broke down, the Trump administration announced in December it would unilaterally implement the policy, forcing Mexico and collection of humanitarian groups to care for those migrants in Mexico.
Nielsen has argued that the policy is needed — and allowed under law — to stem the flood of Central American migrants who are taking advantage of immigration ""loopholes"" by requesting asylum knowing they will be allowed to stay in the country.
In the 2017 fiscal year, Border Patrol agents apprehended 6,301 members of family units a month. In 2018, that rose to 8,934 a month. In the first five months of 2019, it jumped to 27,230 a month.
The Trump administration says those numbers represent a security and humanitarian crisis that forced them to implement the new policy forcing all those asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico.
""The (Migrant Protection Protocols are) a lawful implementation of DHS's broad prosecutorial discretion over when and how to initiate removal proceedings…and whether to limit entry into the country during the pendency of those proceedings,"" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a court filing.
Advocacy groups say the plan puts already-traumatized refugees in yet another traumatizing situation by fending for themselves in northern Mexico, a region that can be incredibly dangerous for people with no family there, no connections, and no protection.
""Instead of being able to focus on preparing their cases, asylum seekers forced to return to Mexico will have to focus on trying to survive,"" read the lawsuit. ""These pressures may deter even those with the strongest asylum claims to give up, rather than endure the wait under such conditions.""
Several of the first asylum-seekers returned to Mexico filed a lawsuit in February, leading to Seeborg's decision."
3725,"Trump's Policy Of Forcing Asylum-Seekers To Wait In Mexico Has Been Blocked By A Federal Judge""",BuzzFeed News,4/8/2019,,,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/trumps-policy-asylum-wait-mexico-blocked-judge,"Under the policy, certain migrants at the border receive a “notice to appear” in US immigration court and are returned to Mexico until their hearing date.
Since January, the policy has been expanded to the entire San Diego sector, including those who cross the border without authorization, along with the Calexico Port of Entry and the El Paso Port of Entry. Before handing in her resignation, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced that the policy would be expanded to other locations along the border.
""Perhaps what is most stunning about the end of 'Remain in Mexico' is the record of harsh, start-stop border policies that it joins, including family separation and the asylum ban. It’s both the chaotic implementation of these policies and this administration’s relentlessly hardline rhetoric that seem to be driving the urgency behind the current migration crisis,"" said Sarah Pierce, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.
The latest challenge was focused on a policy titled “migrant protection protocols,” the most recent attempt by the Trump administration to discourage migrants, including asylum-seekers, from trying to enter the US. The policy went into place on Jan. 28 and initially was focused on single adults at the port of entry in Tijuana.
His decision represents the latest in a string of federal court rulings blocking sweeping immigration changes instituted by the Trump administration, including the travel ban, a ban on asylum for those who crossed the border without authorization, and the repeal of DACA, among others.
""Defendants are hereby enjoined and restrained from continuing to implement or expand the 'Migrant Protection Protocols' as announced in the January 25, 2018 DHS policy memorandum and as explicated in further agency memoranda,"" Seeborg wrote .
The ruling issued by Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco states that the preliminary injunction blocking the policy will take effect on Friday at 5 p.m. PT.
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy of returning Central American migrants to Mexico while they wait for their asylum cases to be processed in the US.
The ACLU lawsuit was filed on behalf of 11 individuals seeking asylum who were taken back to Mexico. In January, the Trump administration informed the Mexican government that it was going to be enacting the policy based on a statute stating that certain individuals can be sent back to the contiguous country they had arrived from.
In its lawsuit, the ACLU claimed that the statute could not be used against asylum-seekers, and that it violates legal protections that prohibit the removal of individuals to a country where they would face persecution.
The group also argued that the administration avoided the regulatory process to institute sweeping changes and did not go through the normally deliberative system that allows for public comment before a new rule is implemented.
Seeborg wrote that ""the statute that vests DHS with authority in some circumstances to return certain aliens to a 'contiguous territory' cannot be read to apply to the individual plaintiffs or others similarly situated. Second, even assuming the statute could or should be applied to the individual plaintiffs, they have met their burden to enjoin the MPP on grounds that it lacks sufficient protections against aliens being returned to places where they face undue risk to their lives or freedom.""
The judge added that the ACLU was ""likely to show"" that the policy did not comply with the Administrative Procedures Act ""because the statute DHS contends the MPP is designed to enforce does not apply to these circumstances, and even if it did, further procedural protections would be required to conform to the government’s acknowledged obligation to ensure aliens are not returned to unduly dangerous circumstances.""
Judy Rabinovitz, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, who argued the case, said that the decision was just one more example of a rejection of the administration’s attempts to shut down asylum for migrants coming to the border.
“It’s another court saying ‘you can’t just carry out these policies in violation of the law. We are a country of law. And the laws say certain things you can do and can’t do,” she said.
One of the plaintiffs, named “Howard Doe,” was kidnapped and held by a Mexican drug cartel for two weeks on his way to the southwestern border, according to the suit. He escaped but fears that the cartel will track him down as he waits in Mexico for his immigration case to proceed. Almost none of the plaintiffs, the ACLU said, were asked about their fear of being returned to Mexico.
In Howard Doe’s case, he was referred to an asylum officer because of his stated fears of returning to Mexico but was still returned to the country without any explanation. Many of the plaintiffs have fears they will be unable to adequately communicate with legal representation in their cases, let alone have a place to sleep at night.
“Plaintiff Frank Doe does not know where he will stay while he prepares his asylum claim,” the suit read. “After being forced to return to Mexico, he attempted to return to the shelter where he resided previously, but officials turned him away because it was full. He was able to find a different shelter to stay for a couple of nights, but he does not have a more permanent residence. Plaintiff Ian Doe was also unable to return to the shelter where he stayed previously.”"

Here's Why.""",Townhall,4/8/2019,,,https://townhall.com/tipsheet/bethbaumann/2019/04/08/judge-blocks-trump-administrations-asylum-policy-heres-why-n2544452,"United States District Judge Richard Seeborg on Monday blocked the Trump administration's policy of sending asylum seekers back to Mexico while they await the court to hear their case, commonly referred to as the ""Remain in Mexico"" program. Judge Seeborg's ruling, however, is being put on hold until Friday so Trump's team has the opportunity to appeal, the Associated Press reported.
The Trump administration made the decision to force asylum seekers to wait in Mexico until their case could be heard because of the number of illegal aliens flocking to the United States-Mexico border. The various caravans traveling from Central American countries, like Guatemala and Honduras, has overwhelmed immigration officials.
The lawsuit was brought about by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Border Rights Center on behalf of various asylum seekers who argued the Trump administration wasn't assessing the danger they're facing in Mexico.
From the AP:
Under the new policy, asylum seekers are not guaranteed interpreters or lawyers and don’t get to argue to a judge that they face the potential of persecution or torture if they are sent back to Mexico, Judy Rabinovitz, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, said at a March court hearing. Seeborg appeared skeptical of the lawsuit’s argument that the administration misapplied a U.S. law that allows the return of immigrants to Mexico. The ACLU and other groups that are suing say that law does not apply to asylum seekers who cross the border illegally or arrive at a border crossing without proper documents. The judge also questioned the Justice Department’s argument that asylum seekers sent back to Mexico are not eligible for certain protections, such as a hearing before an immigration judge. The administration hopes that making asylum seekers wait in Mexico will discourage weak claims and help reduce an immigration court backlog of more than 800,000 cases.
The process was developed after talks between the United States and Mexico. The policy excludes Mexicans and children seeking asylum.
“Remain in Mexico leaves individuals and families fleeing persecution stranded on the other side of the border, when what they need and deserve under our laws is protection in America,” Archi Pyati, chief of policy for the Tahirih Justice Center, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in a statement. ""This policy goes against basic tenets of fairness, and makes it all but impossible for us to do our jobs. We are glad to see justice served.”"

President Donald Trump warned Saturday of “traffic & commercial delays” along the southern border as a result of the administration’s decision earlier this week to ramp up the number of immigration officers processing Central American migrants attempting to enter the U.S. through Mexico.
“We have redeployed 750 agents at the Southern Border’s specific Ports of Entry in order to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants trying to make their way into the United States,” the president wrote on Twitter .

“This will cause traffic & commercial delays until such time as Mexico is able to use … it’s [sic] powerful common sense Immigration Laws to stop illegals from coming through Mexico into the U.S., and removing them back to their country of origin,” Trump continued . “Until Mexico cleans up this ridiculous & massive migration, we will be focusing on Border Security, not Ports of Entry.”
In another post , the president implored congressional Democrats to join with Republican lawmakers and legislate fixes to “the horrible, costly and foolish loopholes” in U.S. immigration statutes.
“Once that happens, all will be smooth,” Trump tweeted. “We can NEVER allow Open Borders!”

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Monday directed Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan to hasten the “temporary reassignment of personnel and resources from across the agency to address the influx of migrants.” She also announced plans to require that greater numbers of non-Mexican asylum-seekers stay in Mexico while they wait for their cases to be resolved.
Trump on Thursday retreated from his earlier threat to shut down the southern border, saying he would first impose auto tariffs on Mexico in an attempt to curb the rate of illegal drugs entering the U.S.
“Before we close the border, we‘ll put the tariffs on the cars,“ the president told reporters in the Oval Office. “I don‘t think we‘ll ever have to close the border.“"

“No, we're witnessing people that are going to be brought out of the country, the country is full,” Trump told Fox News’ Griff Jenkins after being asked whether the second generation of DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) is forming amid new immigrant arrivals, many accompanied by children.
“We have our system full. We can't do it anymore,” Trump continued, slamming the 1997 Flores settlement as “a horror show” for forcing the government to release migrant minors from detention after 20 days.
“We go by this horrible Flores situation. You know that decision is a horror show. We have to release after 20 days and we build big detention areas but they fill up immediately,” he said.
TRUMP VISITS SOUTHERN BORDER AMID GROWING CRISIS, DECLARING THAT ‘OUR COUNTRY IS FULL’
The comments come in the wake of an escalating immigration crisis, with data suggesting Customs and Border Protection is on track to apprehend almost 1 million illegal immigrants at the border this year, and threats to close the southern border.
Trump visited the border area in California on Friday, on his way to events in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. He blamed the border situation on the current immigration system and the Democrats' opposition to his border security measures.
“There's never been so many people coming up and that's because they're gaming the system and the system is changed for the worse because of what happened with Democrats and what they've done in terms of Congress,” Trump said.
“There's never been so many people coming up and that's because they're gaming the system and the system is changed for the worse because of what happened with Democrats and what they've done in terms of Congress.” — President Trump
“So if we change the laws it would be very easy. But in the meantime, Mexico, if they stop the people from coming in, we won't have a lot of people coming at the border.”

Trump said he’s not interested in having a summit with Latin American leaders, as Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has shown progress in helping to combat illegal border crossings.
“No, no I don't need a summit. I think we've done very well without the summit,” he said, adding that presidents of Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador “understand” the seriousness of his administration and the aims to stop the illegal immigration.
“They understand we stopped. We're saving 550 million dollars. And I respectfully told and I thank him very much because for the last four days it's been great. You see that whole stream is drying up,” Trump said, referring to his warning days ago to close the southern border.

5826,"Trump threatens to close border 'next week' if Mexico doesn't 'immediately stop' flood of illegal immigrants""",Fox News (Online),3/30/2019,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-threatens-to-close-southern-border-next-week-if-mexico-doesnt-immediately-stop-illegal-immigrants-from-trying-to-cross-into-us,"President Trump on Friday threatened to close the Southern Border next week if Mexico does not “immediately stop” the record-breaking surge of illegal immigrants flooding into the United States.
Trump's warning comes as Customs and Border Protection officials say March is on pace to exceed 100,000 border apprehensions -- the highest monthly total in a decade. According to CBP, this week alone, agents have more than 12,000 migrants in custody.,
“The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, & they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S.,” Trump tweeted. “Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, & Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S. through their country and our Southern Border.”
“Mexico for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States through[sic] our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week.”
He continued: “This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and ‘talk.’ Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing!”
The president’s tweet comes after similar threats earlier in the week to close the Southern Border, with Trump accusing Mexico and Central American nations of doing “nothing” as illegal immigration surges.
Trump’s initial warning came following comments made by U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAlleenan, who said this week that the border was at its “breaking point,” noting that there are not enough agents to respond to the flow of illegal immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.
“That breaking point has arrived this week at our border,” McAleenan said during a visit to the border in El Paso, Texas. “CBP is facing an unprecedented humanitarian and border security crisis all along our Southwest border.”
His agency also tweeted that they saw the highest number of ""apprehensions and encounters"" in over a decade this week -- over 4,000 in one day: ""#CBP saw the highest total of apprehensions and encounters in over a decade on Monday, with 4,000 migrants either apprehended or encountered at ports of entry in a single day. Yesterday, that record was broken again—4,117 in a single day.""
Last month, more than 76,000 migrants were detained, marking the highest number of apprehensions in 12 years. That figure includes more than 7,000 unaccompanied children. More than 36,000 migrant families have arrived in the El Paso region in fiscal 2019 with about 2,000 at the same time last year, according to CBP data. The influx has prompted new challenges for Border Patrol agents.
And according to new data, the number of adults crossing the border illegally with children has surged. During the first four months of the year, CBP apprehended more than 136,000 migrants made up of adults and children who crossed illegally, marking a new record.
Meanwhile, the president, whose paramount 2016 campaign promise was to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, declared a national emergency in a bid to free up funding for the barrier along the border. This month, the president issued his first veto on a Democrat-backed measure to cancel the emergency.
When asked about his comments, the president said he was serious.
""Mexcio can stop them, but chose not to,"" he told reporters Friday. ""So they're going to stop them, and if they don't, we'll close the border, and we'll keep it closed for a long time.""
He added: ""I'm not playing games.""
On Tuesday, House Democrats failed to override Trump’s veto, allowing Trump to move forward with the issue.
Trump had declared the border emergency under a law that lets him shift budget funds to address dire situations. His plan is to shift an additional $3.6 billion from military construction projects to work on border barriers. Congress voted this year to limit spending on such barriers to less than $1.4 billion, and Democrats accused Trump of ignoring lawmakers' constitutional control over spending.
Fox News' Kristin Brown, Louis Casiano, Andrew O'Reilly and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
2489,Trump adds a deadline on his threat to close the border',CNN (Web News),3/30/2019,,,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/29/politics/donald-trump-border-closure-again/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Friday repeated his threat to close down the border between the United States and Mexico, but this time he noted he would act next week if Mexico doesn't step up.
""If Mexico doesn't immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug (sic) our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week,"" he tweeted.
Trump, in Florida on Friday afternoon, said he could close the border to trade for a ""long time"" and insisted the US had run out of detention space for undocumented immigrants.
""We have the weakest, most pathetic laws,"" the President said, threatening to close the border if two current caravans of migrants cross into the US.
""We have run out of space. We can't hold people anywhere. Mexico can stop it so easily,"" he added.
Trump's comments follow a period in which the Department of Homeland Security and border officials have said their resources have become strained.
Earlier this week, Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said the ""breaking point has arrived"" for the US immigration system.
Over the last two weeks, Customs and Border Protection announced that they will be releasing migrants in Arizona, as well as the Del Rio sector and Rio Grande Valley region of Texas. And more people are expected to be apprehended at the border in March than any month since 2008, CBP says.
What does 'closing the border' mean?

So far, the plan Department of Homeland Security says it will commit to is pulling some officers from legal ports of entry to help with the influx of migrants crossing illegally. This plan will not fully close ports on the southern border as of now.
In a Friday statement announcing the move, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said there is a ""cascading crisis"" at the border and ""the system is in free fall.""
The Department of Homeland Security is moving officers from its ports to help with the mission between ports, which will result in slow downs, a senior Department of Homeland Security official told reporters.
But the official said full closure of ports of entry is ""on the table.""
""It's short at the moment of full closure of any port, we will continue to operationally assess what is needed. But I think what the President is making clear, is with these numbers, if we have to close ports to take care of all of the numbers who are coming, we will do that, so it's on the table,"" the official said. ""But what we are doing is a very structured process based on operational needs to determine how many additional personnel we can pull from other duties to address the crisis between the ports.""
The official said the Department of Homeland Security is ""looking at it from an operational perspective"" and that the Department of Homeland Security secretary will make a ""recommendation accordingly to the President.""
Can Trump legally close the southern border?
The Justice Department declined to comment on the legality of closing the border or any portion of it, as described in the President's tweet. The Justice Department also declined to comment on whether the Office of Legal Counsel has issued an opinion.
Though border closures are rare, they're not unprecedented. For example, in 1985, the abduction of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent and subsequent threats against customs agents prompted then-President Ronald Reagan, in agreement with the Mexican government, to close nine border crossings on the southern border.
Will closing the border stem the flow of migrants illegally crossing into the US?
The Department of Homeland Security official said collaboration with Mexico and shifting resources might start to stem the flow.
However, part of the crisis at hand appears to be the number of individuals and families seeking asylum in the US. Often times, asylum seekers will cross illegally into the US awaiting to be found and processed by a border agent. More personnel between ports of entry may allow more visibility to catch these migrants once they've crossed, but it's unclear whether their presence will make them more likely to avoid crossing in the first place.
It's also unclear whether the closure be limited to individuals crossing into and out of the US. If it includes cross-national trains and trucks importing and exporting goods with Latin America, a closure could pose a major threat to international commerce.
Robert Perez, deputy commissioner for Customs and Border Protection, told ""CNN's Right Now with Brianna Keilar"" on Friday that the closure of ports of entry would have ""pretty severe"" consequences.
""It's Customs and Border Protection at every port of entry. Nearly 400 million travelers a year, $2.3 billion worth of trade, nearly 30 million trucks, rail cars and cargo containers every year,"" Perez said. ""And so, there (will be) a severe impact and this is important to understand because ... what is so important to understand is that the crisis is so severe right now, we are literally trying to save lives.""
Will Trump make good on his threat?
The President seems to be hinting at news to come during a border press event in the coming weeks, at least that's what he told Fox News host Sean Hannity earlier this week.
""In two weeks, I'm going to a location, it's going to be in California. Believe it or not, they were begging us to build in San Diego, begging us to build a wall. And we're just in the process of completing a major stretch of many miles of wall. And we're going to have a news conference there just to show people that ... it's really good stuff,"" Trump said.
He also teased the visit at a rally in Michigan on Thursday.
But Trump has threatened to close the southern border prior to Friday's ultimatum, and he hasn't exactly followed through with it.
Trump tweeted in December that the US will be ""forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with."" But he didn't close the border then.
And last November, a major US-Mexico border crossing in San Diego was closed for hours after a group of hundreds of migrants on the Mexican side rushed the border area, leading US Border Patrol agents to fire tear gas at the group.
The President said at the time that ""if we find that it's uncontrollable"" or it gets to a point where ""our people are going to start getting hurt, we will close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under control.""
""The whole border. I mean the whole border,"" Trump said.
But again, he didn't make good on the threat at the time."

The system is ""well beyond capacity, and remains at the breaking point,"" U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told reporters on Tuesday as the agency released the ""record numbers"" of those trying to enter the U.S. through the southern border.
67 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FOUND IN DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS INSIDE TINY NEW MEXICO 'SHED': ICE
Officials said that 76,103 people — an increase of 31 percent over January — were apprehended. Of those, 7,249 were unaccompanied children, and 40,385 were family units -- totaling 60 percent of apprehensions.
Brian Hastings, the chief of law enforcement operations at the agency, told reporters that historically, 70 to 90 percent of apprehensions at the border included Mexican nationals.
As of Tuesday, he said, 70 percent of those arrested for attempting entry without proper documentation are from the ""Northern Triangle of Central America,"" which includes Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.
""It should be very clear from these numbers that we are facing alarming trends in the rising volumes of people illegally crossing our southwest border, or arriving at our ports of entry without documents,"" McAleenan said.
NEARLY 200 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS APPREHENDED CROSSING BORDER IN NEW MEXICO
While fewer people overall are being apprehended crossing the border illegally each year, he said the increased numbers are ""currently at our highest levels in over a decade both a border security and humanitarian crisis.""
The commissioner added that border patrol is also noticing a ""stark increase"" of those seeking asylum. Since October, there's been a 90 percent increase over the ""record levels"" of asylum seekers since the last fiscal year, according to the agency, which added that 60 percent of those trying to enter the U.S. without proper documentation are ""making claims of fear of return to their home country.""
Officials on Tuesday announced plans for a new processing center in El Paso, Texas, to manage the record number of people crossing the border. While not a permanent solution, it will be better suited to manage families and children, and handle medical care concerns.
“While our enhanced medical efforts will assist in managing the increased flows, the fact is that these solutions are temporary and this solution is not sustainable,” he said.

3857,"Record number of families, cold reality at border'",Washington Post,3/5/2019,,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp/2019/03/04/feature/after-cold-busy-month-at-border-illegal-crossings-expected-to-surge-again/,"In a dusty lot along the U.S.-Mexico border fence, a single Border Patrol agent was stuck with few options and falling temperatures.
A group of 64 parents and children had waded through a shallow bend in the Rio Grande to turn themselves in to the agent on the U.S. side. He radioed for a van driver, but there were none available. By 2 a.m., the temperature was 44 degrees.
The agent handed out plastic space blankets. The group would have to wait.
Mothers and fathers swaddled their families in the silvery, crinkling sheets and clustered with them on the ground, shushing the children. They shivered in the cold wind, and the sound of crying carried on, like a broken alarm.
Groups like this arrived again and again in February, one of the coldest and busiest months along the southern border in years. U.S. authorities detained more than 70,000 migrants last month, according to preliminary figures, up from 58,000 in January. The majority were Central American parents with children who arrived, again, in unprecedented numbers.
During a month when the border debate was dominated by the fight over President Trump’s push for a wall, unauthorized migration in fiscal 2019 is on pace to reach its highest level in a decade. Department of Homeland Security officials say they expect the influx to swell in March and April, months that historically see large increases in illegal crossings as U.S. seasonal labor demand rises.
Migrant families wait for a Border Patrol van to take them to a holding facility in El Paso on Feb. 22. It was cold and windy that night, so a border agent distributed plastic blankets to the group.
The number of migrants taken into custody last year jumped 39 percent from February to March, and a similar increase this month would push levels to 100,000 detentions or more.
It was a surge in the border numbers in March 2018 that infuriated President Trump and launched his administration’s attempt to deter families by separating children from their parents. Trump stopped the separations six weeks later to quell public outrage. But the controversy the policy generated — and its widely publicized reversal — is now viewed by U.S. agents as the moment that opened the floodgates of family migration even wider, worsening the problem it was meant to fix.
While arrests along the border fell in recent years to their lowest levels in half a century, they are now returning to levels not seen since the George W. Bush administration, driven by the record surge in the arrival of Central American families.
For U.S. border agents, the strain has grown more acute, as they struggle to care for children using an enforcement infrastructure made in an era when the vast majority of migrants were Mexican adults who could be quickly booked and deported. The Central American families — called “give-ups” because they surrender instead of trying to sneak in — have left frustrated U.S. agents viewing their own role as little more than the facilitators for the last stage of the migrants’ journey. They are rescuing families with small children from river currents, irrigation canals, medical emergencies and freezing winter temperatures.
“We’re so cold,” said Marlen Moya, who had left Guatemala with her sons six weeks earlier and crossed the Rio Grande with the group of 64.
Moya’s son Gael, 6, was sick with a fever and moaning, his face streaked with tears. “In Juarez, we were shoved and yelled at,” she said, looking back across the river to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. “We slept on the street.”
Asked why she didn’t cross during the day, when temperatures were mild, Moya said she worried that Mexican police would stop them. “We’ve already come this far,” she said.
Marlen Moya, who had left Guatemala with her sons six weeks earlier, holds Gael, 6, as they wait along with Anderson, 8. Moya said she fled Guatemala City after being threatened and robbed at gunpoint at her beauty salon.
Much of the attention last fall was focused on caravan groups, mostly from Honduras, as they reached Tijuana, Mexico, not far from San Diego. Then concern shifted to Arizona and New Mexico, where groups of rural Guatemalan families began showing up at remote border outposts. Two Guatemalan children died in December after being taken into U.S. custody, as Homeland Security officials declared a humanitarian and national security crisis.
The border deal Trump and Democrats reached last month includes $415 million to improve detention conditions for migrant families, including funds to potentially open a new processing center in El Paso. But in the meantime, families continue to arrive in groups large and small, in faraway rural areas and right in downtown El Paso.
“The numbers are staggering, and we’re incredibly worried that we will see another huge increase in March,” said a Homeland Security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the unpublished figures.
The group by the river had landed on the no man’s land between the Rio Grande and the tall, steel American fencing. They were on U.S. soil, a place that already has a border wall.
The lone U.S. agent with the group was the only one available along that span. Drug smugglers have been using the groups as a diversion, so the agent couldn’t leave the riverbank.
No vans or buses arrived to pick up the families. Other agents were busy at the nearby processing center because so many groups had arrived in El Paso that night, and still others were at the hospital, where they were helping parents and children receive treatment for severe flu symptoms.
Homeland Security officials have been urging lawmakers to grant them broader powers to detain and quickly deport families in a search for deterrent measures. Their attempts to crack down using executive actions have been blocked repeatedly in federal court.
The migrants travel by van to a holding facility in El Paso.
The Trump administration has begun sending some asylum-seeking Central Americans back to Mexico to wait while their claims are processed, but so far that experiment has been limited to California’s San Ysidro port of entry.
About 150 migrants were sent back across the border in February, according to Mexican authorities, but that is a small fraction of the more than 2,000 unauthorized migrants coming into U.S. custody on an average day.
Homeland Security officials said Friday that the pilot program, which they call Migrant Protection Protocols, will expand to El Paso and potentially other locations in coming weeks, predicting that the number of Central Americans sent back would grow “exponentially.” Some of the cities where they will wait are among the most dangerous in Mexico.
Mexican officials are cooperating by providing general assistance and job placement for those sent back to wait, but privately they have warned the Americans that their capacity to take parents with children is extremely limited, especially families that need welfare assistance and enrollment in already-crowded public schools.
Migrants at the border hold tight to the blankets and move about the area to stay warm while they wait for the van.
Arrivals and departures
U.S. court restrictions on the government’s ability to keep children in immigration jails — and the sheer volume of people arriving — have left Homeland Security agencies defaulting increasingly to the overflow model Trump deplores as “catch-and-release.”
Volunteer workers from religious charities were visible at the El Paso airport last month, guiding newly arrived Central American families through the terminal, directing them like a tour group.
The adults wore GPS monitors on their ankles and carried manila envelopes with instructions telling them when to appear in court for their asylum claims. Some were traveling in premium seats, the only last-minute tickets available when their families arranged the flights.
It was the first time many of the migrants had been on an airplane. For Dionel Martinez, it was the second.
The 48-year-old Guatemalan came to the United States three decades earlier, working as a landscaper until he was deported — his only other time on a plane.
“We’re going to Pennsylvania,” he said. A friend had arranged a job at a pizzeria there.
With the savings from his first stint in the United States as a young man, Martinez was able to buy some land in his home country and start a family. But a drought this year had left them hungry.
“There was no harvest,” he said. “Not one grain of corn.”
His son Darwin, 13, came with him to the United States this time. The boy fainted during the journey, his father said, when they had to stand for hours in the back of a cattle truck.
Martinez said he paid 30,000 Guatemalan quetzals, about $2,500, to a “coyote” smuggling guide. It was a cheap rate, but it meant that he and his son traveled through Mexico in trucks, like cargo.
Across rural Guatemala, Martinez said, word has spread that those who travel with a child can expect to be released from U.S. custody. Smugglers were offering two-for-one pricing, knowing they just needed to deliver clients to the border — not across it — for an easy surrender to U.S. agents.
The group of 64 migrants came across the Rio Grande and presented themselves to U.S. authorities. Migrant families keep walking to stay warm as they wait for the van in El Paso. The group of 64 includes parents and children hoping to remain in the United States.

“If this continues, I don’t think there will be anyone left in Guatemala,” Martinez joked. The men from his village near the town of Chiquimula were all leaving, he said, bringing a child with them.
Martinez said he used the family home as collateral. He had four months to pay off the $2,500. “I need a way to feed my family, and this is it,” he said.
Not all Central American families are economic migrants. Others, especially from Honduras, arrive with stories of gang threats and violent attacks. After crossing the border, a U.S. asylum officer performs a preliminary screening to determine whether their fears of persecution are credible enough to deserve a hearing with an immigration judge.
The problem, Homeland Security officials say, is that a growing portion of those who pass the initial screening never appear in court. They know asylum standards are tightening. Or, like Martinez, they have a prior deportation from the United States that all but disqualifies them from getting asylum.
Once released into the U.S. interior, some shed their monitoring bracelets and slip into the shadows to remain in the United States, a country where wages are 10 times higher than in Central America.
The saturation at the border means that it matters little whether a parent’s story of persecution is sufficiently credible; the United States has just three detention facilities appropriate for families, with about 3,000 beds, and those are full. The pipeline backs up into Border Patrol stations that were never designed for long-term detention, let alone children, many of whom arrive sick after days in cramped quarters.
A Border Patrol agent in Antelope Wells, N.M., uses his truck as a perch to spot smugglers and groups of migrants approaching the border.
A crossing gone quiet
The tiny, remote Antelope Wells, N.M., border crossing, where 8-year-old Jakelin Caal arrived in December before falling fatally ill, is now staffed with a team of medically trained Border Patrol agents. But that crossing has gone quiet in recent weeks, as more large groups turn up on El Paso’s riverbanks.
For families too poor to hire a smuggler, it was the only place to cross, converging with others who sought safety in numbers. Carlos Guevara, 35, said he and his son had wandered the streets of Juarez with nowhere to sleep, then spotted the crowd heading for the river.
“I want to give my son a better life,” he said. Guevara said he earned about $6 a day for farm labor in Honduras, and left a month earlier with, Carlitos, 7, en route to Michigan. “I can’t stand being poor anymore.”
Swathed in plastic, his son approached the headlights of an agent’s Border Patrol truck, its idling engine offering some warmth. Other children in the group were still crying and calling out.
Ramiro Cordero, a Border Patrol official assigned to accompany reporters, called on the radio, and said he would go back to the nearest station and get a van himself.
Border Patrol official Ramiro Cordero puts bracelets on Mairon Argueta and his daughter Elsi Argueta, 4, who arrived in El Paso from Honduras. The bracelets identify the group of migrants and how many people crossed.
“This is what’s happening on a daily basis,” Cordero said. “You’ve got to understand that we have to take care of everyone that comes across. And this requires transportation and a lot of logistical support.”
“Hopefully the vans can get here to transport them to one of the processing facilities,” he said. “But for right now, this is where we stay.”
He lined up the parents and children to issue bracelets to each one with a number corresponding to their arrival group. “They will be provided with basic needs, whether it’s water, juices, warm meals,” Cordero said. They would also get a medical screening.
Two blue-uniformed customs officers, summoned to help the Border Patrol agents, arrived with a van after 3 a.m.
The agents loaded the families into the vehicle, needing three trips to transport the entire group. The crying had stopped. On the radio, a dispatcher said there were already 607 migrants in custody at the processing center where they were headed, more than twice its capacity."

4662,Courts Should Not Defer to Trump\xe2\x80\x99s National-Security Pretext',National Review,2/15/2019,,,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/trump-border-wall-national-security-pretext-courts-should-not-defer/,"President Trump talks with a Border Patrol agent while touring border wall prototypes near the Otay Mesa Port of Entry in San Diego, Calif., March 13, 2018. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)
Earlier today, Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced that President Trump will sign the compromise government funding bill and “will also take other executive action — including a national emergency — to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border.” These are ominous words, indicating that the president is prepared to defy Congress and the plain language of the relevant statutes in a blatant abuse of power. Moreover, because he’s apparently set to invoke “national security,” the stakes are particularly high. Here’s why.

Traditionally, the Supreme Court has granted the president an immense amount of deference on matters of national security. While that deference isn’t unlimited (see Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer), as a general matter, courts are reluctant to intervene when the president invokes his powers as commander-in-chief, preferring to leave key national security determinations to the political branches. But if the courts defer here, they’ll set a dangerous precedent. They’ll permit the president to override a comprehensive civilian statutory border-protection scheme in the absence of any armed conflict or event the reasonable prospect of any armed conflict on the southern border.
The border-security mission with an allied nation is a civilian mission. The border wall is a civilian structure that will be manned by civilian government employees. The border-security scheme is set by congressional statute (and is set to be modestly supplemented by the very compromise funding bill that Trump is about to defy). The wall is not a military fortification. Moreover, crime prevention and the enforcement of criminal laws is also fundamentally a civilian mission. The president waving his hands and citing “national security” doesn’t change any of these facts.

If the Supreme Court wants to maintain deference in the case of war or the prospect of war, it can still check Trump without doing any damage to the commander-in-chief’s constitutional military authority. There can and should be one degree of deference in the presence or prospect of an armed conflict under international law and lesser deference in the absence of an armed conflict or the prospect of an armed conflict. Otherwise “national security” simply means whatever the president says it means, and it can be invoked at will to enable a host of abuses.
It has become plain that we cannot trust presidents to police their own use of power. They will press to the very limits, trusting partisan allies in the House or Senate to limit any congressional response. That’s the story of DACA and DAPA, and Trump hopes that’s the story of his national-emergency declaration. But the judicial power of the Article III courts encompasses the ability to interpret statutes enacted by Congress, and courts abdicate their constitutional role if they delegate to the chief executive the interpretation of the national-security statutes that he seeks to enforce.

4740,What is a national emergency? Can Trump declare one for the wall?',Al Jazeera,2/15/2019,,,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/national-emergency-trump-declare-wall-190214225808895.html,"US President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency in a bid to fund his promised wall at the US-Mexico border without congressional approval, an action Democrats vowed to challenge as a violation of the US Constitution.
The Republican president's move to circumvent Congress represented a new approach to making good on a 2016 presidential campaign pledge to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants into the country.
Trump began weighing whether to declare a national emergency after Democrats refused to cave to his demand for $5.7bn in funding for the wall, prompting a 35-day government shutdown - the longest in US history.
That shutdown ended last month after Trump, his fellow Republicans, and Democrats came to an agreement to open the government for three weeks while talks continued on border security.
Facing a Friday deadline, congressional leaders came to an agreement earlier this week aimed at keeping the government open. Although it includes $1.37bn in funding to help build physical barriers on the border, it does not include money for concrete walls, forcing Trump to look elsewhere for funding.
190214201620950
Here's a look at what a national emergency is, and why Democrats and many experts say Trump does not have the legal authority to declare one in this context.
What is a national emergency? What will happen once it's declared?
US federal law gives a number of powers to the president to use in response to a ""crisis, exigency, or emergency circumstances threatening the nation"", a document prepared for Congress states. He can do so at will.
Declaring a national emergency allows the president to meet the problems of ""governing effectively"" in times of crisis. They also allow the president to ""seize property, organise and control the means of production, seize commodities, assign military forces abroad, institute martial law, seize and control all transportation and communication, regulate the operation of private enterprise, restrict travel, and, in a variety of ways, control the lives of United States citizens,"" the document states.
Declaring a national emergency is a rare step. In this case, it would allow Trump to redirect federal funds from elsewhere to pay for his border wall.
190214201620950
Jessica Levinson, political law professor at Loyola Law School, said although Trump had the power to declare an emergency at any moment, it would be a complicated process.
""He has to say 'here's an emergency and here's what I need',"" she told Al Jazeera.
""I need more money, I need more people, etc,"" she added. ""But the question is then if he waited so long to do this, and the country went through a government shutdown over this, how is it an emergency now? Where is the urgency?""
It's also unclear where Trump can get the funding because Congress would still need to earmark money for the wall. However, some legal experts have told local media that Trump may be able to turn to unallocated funds in the Department of Defense's budget.
A source told Reuters that the White House lawyers had vetted the figures and believed they would withstand a legal challenge.
Levinson said to expect a legal battle once Trump declares a national emergency.
""At that point, people will sue and say this is not an emergency,"" she said.
Fifteen Democrats in the Republican-controlled Senate introduced legislation prior to Trump's declaration to prevent Trump from invoking emergency powers to transfer funds to his wall from accounts Congress has already committed to other projects.
New York state's attorney general, Letitia James, said her office would also challenge Trump in court.
Under the Constitution, Congress holds the national purse strings and makes major decisions on spending taxpayer money.
Disputes over the constitutionality or legality of the exercise of emergency powers are judicially reviewable, the document prepared for Congress states.
What does Trump say?
Trump, who campaigned on a promise to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, had demanded Congress allocate $5.7bn in funding for the wall.
181210211443443
But Democrats, who recently took control of the House of Representatives, refused, calling the wall ineffective, expensive and immoral.
The legislation hammered out by Congress this week does not include money for a concrete wall, but it does allocate $1.37bn in funding for physical barriers.
But Trump hopes by ordering the national emergency he can still follow through on his campaign promise.
Trump estimated his emergency declaration could free up as much as $8bn to pay for part of the wall. Estimates of its total cost run as high as $23bn.
The president acknowledged that his order would face a lengthy court fight.
""I expect to be sued. I shouldn't be sued ... We'll win in the Supreme Court,"" Trump predicted as he announced the national emergency.
On Monday, as congressional leaders announced a compromise that didn't include wall funding, Trump declared in front of a rally of supporters that he was going to get the wall built one way or the other.
""Just so you know - we're building the wall anyway,"" Trump said.
The president maintains that the wall is necessary to stem irregular immigration and drug trafficking.
But statistics show that irregular immigration has dropped to a 20-year low and that many drug shipments are likely smuggled through official ports of entry, leading critics to argue a wall is not needed.
Confronted with those statistics at a Rose Garden event with reporters, Trump said they were ""wrong"".
What do Democrats say?
Democrats have long resisted Trump's call for a wall and said the president had fabricated a ""crisis"" at the border to justify an unconstitutional grab for funding.
Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer swiftly responded to Trump's declaration.
""The president's actions clearly violate the Congress’s exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution,"" they said in a statement.
""The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the courts, and in the public, using every remedy available,” they added.
On Thursday, Pelosi said there was no crisis at the border with Mexico that requires a national emergency order.
190104163142319
""If the president can declare an emergency on something that he has created as an emergency - an illusion that he wants to convey - just think of what a president with different values can present to the American people,"" Pelosi added, pointing to gun violence in the United States as a national emergency.
She said Democrats were prepared to respond appropriately to a declaration of national emergency.
What do Americans say?
The majority of Americans continue to oppose expanding the border wall.
Of 1,505 adults surveyed last month in a Pew Research Center poll, 58 percent said they opposed substantial wall expansions while 40 percent said favoured wall expansions.
Partisan differences are widening as Republican support for the wall is at a record high at 82 percent, an increase of 10 percent from last year, while Democratic support has reached a new low at 6 percent, down from 13 percent last year.
Although opinion over wall expansions have not seen a substantial change from last year, they have never been more sharply divided along partisan lines."
2647,4 winners and 4 losers from the funding bill and emergency declaration',Vox,2/15/2019,,,https://www.vox.com/2019/2/15/18224715/trump-emergency-national-news-border-wall,"The long-term effects of President Donald Trump’s decision to declare a national emergency Friday — unlocking an additional $7.5 billion to build physical barriers (a “wall”) on the US-Mexico border, in addition to the $1.375 billion appropriated by Congress in the bill Trump signed to fund the government through September 30 — won’t be fully known or understood until the historians get to them.
The emergency declaration itself could be held up in court for months or years. The construction of barriers it authorizes, if allowed to go forward, could take years more. The influence it has (or lack thereof) on norms of executive authority, and the precedent it may or may not set for future political actions, will be the subject of endless debate.
But what happened Friday morning wasn’t just the start of some new and uneasy moment. It was the culmination of a months-long funding battle that resulted in the longest (partial) government shutdown in history. Trump just signed a bill that sets funding levels (and keeps the government open) for the next six months, in addition to making some policy changes around the edges. And the emergency declaration alters political dynamics in Washington that are going to have an impact on what change various politicians can make in the future.
The “winners” and “losers” here are the real effects on people’s lives; even the rising or falling stock of a given politician matters for the policy and institutional agendas he seeks to advance. Even if Trump’s declaration of national emergency opens a whole set of new fights, there are people whose fortunes are definitely better or worse after this morning.
Winner: federal employees
Thanks to Donald Trump’s uncanny ability to make it all about him, the national emergency declaration is getting most of the attention right now. But it’s important not to lose sight of the fact that Congress just passed (and the president just signed) a bill to fund nine Cabinet departments and a host of federal agencies through the end of the fiscal year on September 30. And unlike the emergency declaration — which even the Department of Justice anticipates will almost certainly be slowed by the courts — the funding bill is actually going into effect.
In other words, the United States has just ensured that we won’t have another government shutdown for at least six and a half months.
That might not seem like much of a respite. But it’s the longest respite the federal government — and federal employees — have had since Trump came into office.
It’s not just that there have been three shutdowns over the past two years (though two of them happened over weekends and thus barely affected federal employees), or that the shutdown that ended three weeks ago was the longest in history. It’s that when the government has been open, it’s often been running on short-term continuing resolutions. Over Trump’s time in office, a normal budgeting process would have had the government face two funding deadlines, when the fiscal years ended for 2017 and 2018; instead, it’s faced 12. And many of those have gone down to the wire.
Many federal employees will be dealing with the financial aftermath of January’s shutdown (and their delayed paychecks) for some time. But the uncertainty of governance-by-continuing-resolution has its own costs to federal employees’ budgets and psyches. Six and a half months is, relatively speaking, a high degree of certainty.
Furthermore, it’s possible that Trump’s breaking the seal on the national emergency might reduce the risk of future government funding brinksmanship. The president has been threatening to shut down the government over the wall since spring 2017; he finally did it, it didn’t work, and now he’s trying something else. It’s possible that if he no longer sees threatening shutdown as the best way to get what he wants, the next two years might give federal employees more than a few weeks at a time before they have to worry about when they’re getting their next paycheck.
And the cherry on top: Defying Trump’s effort to freeze federal salaries, Congress authorized a 1.8 percent pay raise in the funding bill for civilian feds.
Loser: the “power of the purse”
It’s a staple of fifth-grade civics units: The federal government is made of three co-equal branches kept in equilibrium by a system of “checks and balances,” and one of the most important checks that the legislative branch has on the executive — arguably Congress’s most important power, period — is the “power of the purse.”
Congress appropriates money to the executive branch, and Congress determines how that money gets spent. The executive branch might be legally obligated to submit a budget, but the legislative branch has no legal obligation to pay attention to it.
In practice, the executive branch has some options when it wants to move money around. And Congress has passed laws that give the executive branch even more powers in the case of a national emergency — though an emergency declaration unlocks a long list of specific powers, not a blank check to do whatever the president wants.
But even if Trump’s national emergency declaration is a valid exercise of the National Emergencies Act of 1976 — and it will be up to the courts to figure that out — the fact remains: The president of the United States demanded that Congress fund a policy priority of his, Congress refused to fund it at the levels demanded, and the president responded by directing billions more dollars to it anyway.
What really distinguishes this emergency declaration from others isn’t necessarily the factual question of what counts as a national emergency. It’s the fact that Trump telegraphed what he was going to do for weeks — while Congress was negotiating with him and with itself over government funding. Trump was absent from the negotiations that produced this funding bill. He’d already made it clear that if he didn’t get what he wanted from Congress, he’d simply get it another way.
Of course, Trump’s obviousness is going to make it that much harder for the Department of Justice to defend the emergency declaration from the inevitable lawsuits. But that’s the story of the federal government over the past decade or so: The executive branch makes policy, and the judicial branch decides whether to uphold it. The legislative branch is left giving vaguely disapproving quotes to the press.
Loser: Mitch McConnell
Mitch McConnell finally tried to stand up to Donald Trump, and Trump made him back down.
The Senate majority leader’s approach to the mercurial president has been to let Trump decide what he wants and then put varying levels of legislative elbow grease into making that happen. It’s a smart approach, if the goal is to protect your incumbent Republican senators: It avoids the worst-case scenario in which senators take a tough vote on a bill because they think the president will sign it, only to have Trump reject the bill and whip up the base against its supporters. Of course, when the president doesn’t say what he wants — or isn’t willing to modify his demands into something that can actually pass — you risk government shutdowns.
McConnell cares more about preventing shutdown than Trump does. So after the government reopened in January, he let his appropriators (led by Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby) actually make a deal first and get the president’s approval later.
At the same time, though, McConnell let it be known that he didn’t want Trump to declare a national emergency. (The Washington Post headline was “McConnell privately cautions Trump about emergency declaration on border wall,” but someone had to tell the Post about the “private” cautioning.) It was an effort to preserve some legislative power vis-à-vis the president — not least in case the Senate was still in Republican hands the next time the presidency was in Democratic ones.
But McConnell couldn’t prevent both a shutdown and an emergency. Before Republican senators were willing to vote for the deal Thursday, they needed assurance the president would actually sign it. And the president’s assurance, apparently, only came when he decided to sign the emergency declaration at the same time.
The result is that McConnell, who let it be known he didn’t want a national emergency, had to stand on the Senate floor and say he supported the president’s decision to sign one to keep the government open. Worse, if the House successfully passes a resolution attempting to reverse the declaration, it will go straight to the Senate floor — McConnell has no power to block it. McConnell will have to either risk embarrassing Republican defections that could kill an emergency declaration he himself is now on the record supporting or whip Republican votes to save an emergency declaration he didn’t want.
Trump’s method of “negotiating” — find various ways to get what you want and wear the other guy down instead of compromising — hasn’t usually worked in Washington. It just worked on, of all people, Mitch McConnell.
Winner: 2020 Democrats
As Democratic politicians have started declaring their candidacies for the 2020 presidential primary and sketching out their policy proposals, they’re inevitably hit with two questions: “How are you going to pay for it?” and “How is that going to get 60 votes in the Senate and survive a filibuster?”
Trump just gave them an easy way to answer both questions at once: declare a national emergency.
Democrats are already threatening to use emergency powers in future to pass their own preferred policies to address the things they think are crises. They’re not digging into the specific emergency authorities they would use, and in some cases, there probably aren’t any available — unlocking emergency funds doesn’t necessarily give you a way to expand gun regulation, for example. But presidential candidates don’t tend to get punished by the voters for overstating the scope of their potential powers.
Almost as importantly, Trump’s emergency declaration distracts political attention from what could have been the first big intra-Democratic fight of the primary. The funding bill Congress passed Thursday was attacked by progressives in the immigrant rights movement for its expansion of immigration detention and what they perceived as insufficient checks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Several presidential candidates — including Sens. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) — voted against it. Others — including Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and the still-undeclared-but-likely candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — voted for.
Under normal circumstances, those on each side of the bill would now be dogged by questions about their votes — and invited to attack candidates who disagreed. But now, there’s something else for reporters to ask about: an emergency declaration that every Democrat will agree is unnecessary and destructive.
Winner: immigration detention
The Trump administration has played hardball on immigration detention with Congress, and it appears to be paying off.
The bill gives ICE money to keep an average of 45,274 immigrants in detention between now and September 30. That’s more, by far, than Congress has ever funded ICE for in advance before. It is, however, less than the number of people actually in detention right now — more than 49,000 as of the beginning of this week.
In theory, then, ICE is going to have to release some immigrants from detention, or choose not to detain new ones after they’re arrested. Democrats hope that by the end of September, ICE will have the detained population down to 40,520 or so — the level that Congress authorized in its 2018 funding package but that ICE vastly exceeded.
But there’s no way to force ICE to stick to its budget this time either. The Trump administration retains its authority to move some money from other things into ICE detention.
The bill includes money for “alternatives to detention,” and restarts a case management program for asylum-seeking families that immigrant rights advocates have long championed as a better approach. But the Trump administration is deeply skeptical of anything that could allow asylum seekers to “abscond” and miss their court dates. Furthermore, the administration is adamant that it needs to detain every immigrant with a criminal conviction or charge in order to protect the safety of the American people, and those make up a majority of the immigrants ICE arrests (as opposed to those apprehended coming into the US).
It’s very possible the administration will continue its tactic of detaining people first and finding the money (or asking Congress for help) later.
Loser: “Build the wall”
Seriously, hear me out.
Yes, Trump has as much as $9 billion to build barriers on the US-Mexico border as a result of this morning’s actions (though how much of that money is ultimately available to him will depend on the outcome of the inevitable national emergency lawsuit). But the months-long fight over funding has demonstrated conclusively that no one can actually agree on what counts as a wall — including the president and the conservative media elites who have occasionally threatened to stir up the base against him.
Without a consensus about what the “wall” is, the fight over it can never get resolved. Trump can declare victory — or Democrats, thwarting him, can declare his defeat on his behalf — but it won’t necessarily stick. When both sides can declare victory, the fight just goes on for another round.
Democrats in Congress crowed that the $1.375 billion they appropriated in this funding bill wasn’t money for a “wall,” because they only authorized that money to be used for “fencing” that conformed to designs already in place on the US-Mexico border. But that’s exactly what the administration was asking for to begin with.
Even before the government shutdown, the Department of Homeland Security said it would use the $5.7 billion Trump was demanding to build steel bollard fencing, the same thing Congress has funded. The Trump administration says it’s now using the emergency declaration money to complete those same projects — and it’s explicitly said it’s using bollards. So the “wall” Trump is building with the emergency declaration is going to be identical to the “not a wall” Congress authorized.
Without agreement on whether Trump is currently building the wall or not, how can Trump declare he’s completed it? How can Democrats declare he’s funded it?
President Trump recognizes the pickle he’s in. He turned “build the wall” into a political slogan among people who didn’t understand the border security status quo or what would actually be workable. Now he’s trying to get his base to pivot to “finish the wall” as a way of squaring the circle — and they’re not buying it. There will be future fights over “wall” funding, and they will probably get hopelessly buried in semantics. Because the idea of the “wall” as an entity that people could agree on, and decide to fund or not, is dead.
Winner: congressional oversight
The power of the legislative branch may have taken a big hit Friday, but there is a silver lining for Congress — or at least House Democrats. The funding bill shows that Democrats are serious about providing oversight of the administration — and it demonstrates how robust oversight can change policy.
The bill includes robust reporting requirements for ICE and CBP — on the number of immigrants in detention, any ongoing separation of families at the border (and updates on continued questions about how many families were separated in 2017 and early 2018), and how exactly CBP plans to spend the money it’s authorized for construction and infrastructure. It also instructs the inspector general to continue spot checks of immigration detention centers, while barring ICE and CBP from preventing any member of Congress from entering a facility to inspect it.
Ideally, oversight isn’t just a way to name and shame the executive branch for doing things the opposition finds unconscionable. In theory, it can occasionally lead to actual changes in policy, law, or funding. There’s some of that in the bill too.
In the past, Democrats in Congress have shown particular interest in the treatment of pregnant women in immigration detention; there’s a very strict ban in the bill on the shackling of any pregnant woman in the custody of immigration agents.
Last year, questions from Congress (and follow-up reporting) revealed that ICE arrested some unauthorized immigrants who had agreed to sponsor children who had come to the US unaccompanied. This bill bars ICE from spending any appropriated money on enforcement against sponsors of unaccompanied children.
Oversight doesn’t have to be antagonistic — it can be a way for members of Congress to understand why the administration wants what it wants.
The bill doesn’t give the administration the $800 million in “humanitarian” funding it asked for to improve treatment of children and families — something some congressional Democrats have professed concern about after the deaths of two children in CBP custody in December — but it does give $415 million. About half of that money would be used to build a new processing center for families in Texas, as an alternative to holding families in places that aren’t designed to hold immigrants at all; the rest would be used to hire medical contractors, provide better food and more diapers, and increase CBP’s capacity to move immigrants to a suitable facility even if they’re apprehended in a remote location.
Some progressives are deeply upset with the bill for its expansion of immigrant detention; some progressive first-term members (led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) had insisted that ICE and CBP have their budgets reduced, not expanded. But there are more restrictions on how that money can be spent, and what the administration has to do to keep Congress from reducing it next time out of pique or distrust, than there would be if Republicans were in charge.
Loser: federal contractors
Federal employees are getting back pay for their work during the partial government shutdown. But as many as 580,000 federal contractors — from security guards and janitors to researchers and IT workers — aren’t getting their lost wages back.
Democrats, led by Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith, had wanted to add a bill to the final spending package that would have guaranteed contractors wages they had missed out on because of the impasse. They were blocked, however, by Senate Republicans and the White House.
One Trump administration official told HuffPost that implementing a process to dole out back pay could wind up being costly for federal agencies. But a representative from the Professional Services Council, a group that advocates on behalf of contractors, told the Hill he didn’t think that was actually the case.
Because of the disagreement among negotiators and the tight timeline on completing this spending deal, federal contractors have once again been left out in the cold. Many contractors said they had struggled to cover day-to-day living costs during the shutdown, including medication, baby formula, and child care.
Smith has said she’ll keep pushing for contractors to receive the compensation they need. But for now — if Trump signs this spending agreement — all they have is the reassurance that the federal government won’t shut down again for at least six more months. —Li Zhou"
2521,"Trump's emergency declaration would trigger a drawn out legal fight""",USA TODAY,2/14/2019,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/14/donald-trump-emergency-border-wall-long-legal-fight/2548526002/,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump will declare a national emergency to speed up funding for his proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, but experts said the move would create a legal morass that could take until the middle of next year to resolve.
The White House announced Thursday that Trump will make the move that he'd suggested for weeks. The announcement came as Congress readied legislation that would devote $1.375 billion to the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump demanded.
Declaring an emergency would let Trump sidestep Democratic opposition to more wall funding, but it could draw legal challenges from lawmakers and others who viewed the move as a power grab. Although that could delay construction of his border barriers, an extended legal battle would give Trump a potent political issue to run on in the 2020 presidential election.
""Everyone’s going to come out of the woodwork,"" said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas-Austin law professor who teaches national security law. ""I think we’re going to see an array of lawsuits that actually would all have to be dealt with separately.""
More:How congressional Democrats could fight a Trump wall emergency declaration
More:What to know about national emergencies and their role in US history
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the administration is ""very prepared"" for legal challenges.
The potential for an extended legal battle may explain why Trump backed away from the emergency scenario last month. The president, who faced criticism from some Republicans for the idea, said he wouldn't declare an emergency imminently. Republicans noted a future Democratic president could also use an emergency to work around Congress.
Litigation could go all the way to the Supreme Court, which has smacked down attempts by both Trump and President Barack Obama to make end runs around Congress. How long that takes would depend on several factors:
• Which programs the White House might try to tap for funding.
• Whether Trump tries to speed the seizure of property from unwilling owners.
• Who could be harmed by the order and would have the right to sue.
• What court or courts are chosen by challengers seeking favorable verdicts.
For weeks, Trump weighed invoking a national emergency as the political impasse over the wall led to a partial government shutdown that became the longest in U.S. history. White House aides acknowledged that lawyers reviewed the ramifications.
The president expressed confidence in the legal strategy. ""The law is 100 percent on my side,"" he said.
Democrats blasted the move. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer called the decision a ""gross abuse of the power of the presidency"" in a joint statement.
Legal experts differed over how much latitude Trump would have to free up money for the wall on his own. They cautioned that those who favor an emergency declaration may trade a deadlock in Congress for a lengthy legal fight in the federal judiciary.
Walter Dellinger, an assistant attorney general and head of the Office of Legal Counsel under President Bill Clinton, said a lawsuit could reach the Supreme Court in a matter of months but probably would not be resolved quickly.
“I think that a clear majority of the Supreme Court will be deeply troubled by the invocation of emergency authority in this case,” Dellinger said. ""In the normal course, we might not expect a decision until June of 2020 at the earliest.""
Presidents have broad authority to declare an emergency but are more restricted in how they can use it. White House officials zeroed in on provisions that would let Trump capture unused money Congress set aside for other purposes.
“None of these statutes is a blank check,"" Vladeck said.
Another question that would have to be decided early in the process: Who has the right to sue? Lawmakers might sue by arguing the president usurped their power through an emergency declaration. Homeowners on the border whose property could be seized to build the wall also might have a case, experts said.
Litigation may turn in part on whether Trump erred in declaring an emergency in the first place. Though the president described the situation on the border as a ""security and humanitarian crisis,"" the number of people apprehended attempting to cross the border illegally has fallen considerably over the past decade.
Courts have traditionally given presidents leeway to decide matters of national security.
""There’s just not a lot of guidance in these statutes about what actually constitutes a national emergency,"" said Margaret Taylor, senior editor and counsel at the legal blog Lawfare and a former Democratic aide on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""Congress and the courts have been deferential to presidents on that decision.""
On the other hand, presidents have faced successful challenges after they took action to sidestep Congress. Obama's effort to shield from deportation about 5 million undocumented immigrants through an executive order faced a high-profile lawsuit from Texas that dragged on for months before the Supreme Court killed the program.
Challengers presumably would bring their lawsuits to district court judges they considered likely to look askance at Trump’s action – a practice known as “forum shopping” that’s used by both liberals and conservatives to improve their chances. Liberals often file cases within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, based in California; conservatives often opt for the 5th Circuit, which includes Texas.
Signaling that he may have learned from the extended legal challenge that for months blocked his travel ban on predominately Muslim countries, Trump predicted opponents might try to bring a challenge to an emergency declaration in the 9th Circuit.
""What will happen? I'll be sued. It'll be brought to the 9th Circuit. We'll probably lose there, too,"" Trump said. ""And then hopefully we'll win in the Supreme Court."""

The most common reason people are opposed to the news: they're afraid Democrats will utilize national emergencies in the future to push for policies they can't get through Congress.

Lawmakers in both parties sharply criticized President Donald Trump on Thursday for planning to declare a national emergency to build his long-promised border wall.
""Declaring a national emergency would be a lawless act, a gross abuse of the power of the presidency and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that President Trump broke his core promise to have Mexico pay for his wall,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement.
“It is yet another demonstration of President Trump's naked contempt for the rule of law. This is not an emergency, and the president's fear-mongering doesn't make it one,"" they added.
Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, also advised against such a move by the president.
""I think it's a dangerous step,"" Cornyn said.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump would sign a congressional deal to avoid a shutdown Friday but will also declare a national emergency ""to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border.""
The potential emergency declaration, which Trump could try to use to obtain existing government funds from agencies and departments to build the wall without congressional approval, set off a chorus of criticism from Democrats and Republicans.

""It would be a gross abuse of power — and likely illegal — for President Trump to go around Congress to fund his wall. Inventing an unnecessary national emergency would be a power grab that would likely be blocked by the courts,"" Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said in a tweet.
Democrats highlighted other pressing problems for which they said a national emergency would be appropriate and accused Trump of manufacturing a crisis at the border to uphold a campaign promise to build a wall on the southern border.
""Gun violence is a national emergency. Climate Change is a national emergency. Income inequality is a national emergency. Access to healthcare is a national emergency. Building a wall on the southern border is not,"" Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., tweeted Thursday.

Rep. Mike Levin, D-Calif., said in a statement he would ""support every effort to challenge his declaration in court.""
""We cannot allow the president to get away with a national emergency declaration, which is a clear abuse of power and likely unconstitutional,"" he said.
Sen. Brian Schatz‏, D-Hawaii, said he could only imagine the blowback if President Barack Obama had tried the same thing.
""The inability to negotiate with a coequal branch is not an emergency. A failure to secure money is just not just the same as a natural disaster or terrorism event. And I look forward to a big bipartisan vote rejecting this nonsense. Can you imagine the screaming (if) Obama did this?"" he asked.
A number of Republicans also said they would oppose any emergency declaration, arguing that it sets a precedent for a future Democratic administration and amounts to presidential overreach.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., criticized the administration for the idea of issuing a national declaration, as well as Congress voting on a voluminous bill with little time for consideration.
""I, too, want stronger border security, including a wall in some areas. But how we do things matters. Over 1,000 pages dropped in the middle of the night and extraconstitutional executive actions are wrong, no matter which party does them,"" Paul said in a tweet.
""I’m disappointed with both the massive, bloated, secretive bill that just passed and with the president's intention to declare an emergency to build a wall,"" he added.
Other Republican lawmakers echoed Paul's concerns, worried that such a move by Trump would embolden a future Democratic president to tackle controversial issues such as gun violence.
""I do not support this decision because declaring a national emergency sets a very dangerous precedent that undermines our constitutional separation of powers. By circumventing Congress and Article I of the Constitution, President Trump is opening the door for any future president to act alone without congressional approval,"" Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wa., said in a statement.
""If elected president, how would Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders use this precedent for a national disaster declaration to force the Green New Deal on the American people?""

Trump said Tuesday that he was ""not happy"" with the tentative deal reached by congressional negotiators late Monday night that falls far short of his original demands.
On Wednesday, he told reporters he would ""take a very serious look"" at the legislation, adding that he does not want the government to shut down again.

Mr. Trump said he would take a serious look at the legislation, which includes far less money for barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border than he has demanded, but gave no assurance he would sign it. He said he doesn’t want to see another government..."
6189,"Trump says he has other 'options' for paying for border wall""",Washington Times,2/13/2019,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/feb/13/donald-trump-likely-sign-border-deal-avoid-governm/,"President Trump says he made his point — the U.S. needs a border wall, and he will build it with or without Congress.
Rather than force another unpopular and economically harmful government shutdown, Mr. Trump sounds increasingly willing to accept the agreement in Congress that provides about $1.3 billion for border barriers. That’s less than one-fourth of the $5.7 billion that he demanded initially for a wall.
“I think a point was made with the last shutdown,” the president said Wednesday. “People realized how bad the border is, how unsafe the border is.”
Lawmakers sorted out the details of the agreement and released details of the bill early Thursday morning. The House and Senate will be voting on the bill later in the day.
The nearly 1,800-page spending bill has money for 55 miles of new border “fencing” in Texas, and money to maintain a daily average of 45,274 detention beds under Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, the agency that now holds more than 49,000 immigrants who live in the U.S. illegally in custody. The bill also provides the authority to move cash around to go above that level, if the Homeland Secretary determines it’s needed.
When that question and others were still unresolved late Wednesday, the conservative House Freedom Caucus called for a one-week extension of stopgap funding to keep the government open and give lawmakers more time to review the fine print of the border deal. Congress is facing a Friday deadline to approve spending bills to keep nine government agencies open.
The agreement would pay for 55 miles of border fencing or barriers, but not concrete walls, in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. The president and his advisers are exploring other ways to shift money within departments to pay for more barriers, an option that is riling up congressional Democrats.
“He needs congressional permission to do it,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, who noted that Democrats now hold the House majority. “He doesn’t have the authority to do it without House permission.”
But Republicans say the law gives presidents some flexibility with so-called “transfer authority” to shift already-appropriated funds toward border security. Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri has cited as an example about $900 million for fighting drug trafficking that was appropriated to the Pentagon.
Mr. Trump is increasingly delivering the message that he’s already building the wall, regardless of Congress, saying he has “options.”
“When people see what we’re doing, I think they’ll be very surprised,” he said. “We’re doing a lot of work. We’re giving out contracts right now. We have options that most people don’t really understand.”
Speaking later Wednesday to law enforcement groups, Mr. Trump vowed to “finish the border wall.”
“As we review the new proposal from Congress, I can promise you this — I will never waver from my sacred duty to defend this nation and its people,” he said. “We will get the job done. It’s happening.”
He told police chiefs and county sheriffs that the barrier will be “a big wall.”
“It’s a wall that people aren’t going through very easy,” the president said. “You’d have to be in extremely good shape to get over this one. They would be able to climb Mount Everest a lot easier, I think.”
The president, who vowed last December that he would be “proud” to shut down the government over the principle of border security, made clear that he doesn’t want to repeat the episode that forced 800,000 federal workers to go without pay for 35 days.
“A shutdown would be a terrible thing,” Mr. Trump said. “I think a lot of good points were made, but I don’t want to see another one — there’s no reason for it.”
While much of Mr. Trump’s Republican base supported the shutdown that started Dec. 22, voters overall disapproved. Gallup said Wednesday that Mr. Trump’s job-approval rating fell to 35 percent in mid-January during the shutdown, but had climbed back to 44 percent in early February after he agreed to reopen the government.
The increase was largely attributable to more-positive comments from independents, pollsters said.
A Morning Consult/Politico survey released Wednesday found that only 33 percent of respondents support a second shutdown over Mr. Trump’s demand for a border wall.
Some influential conservatives aren’t heaping as much public pressure on Mr. Trump this time to force a shutdown.
Fox News host Sean Hannity called the new agreement a “garbage compromise” when it came out Monday night, but he has since toned down his criticism, referring to the $1.3 billion as a “down payment” on the wall and suggesting the administration can find more money elsewhere in the federal budget.
“In that case, he wins big time,” Mr. Hannity said on his daily radio show.
Critics of the president are saying that he got nothing from the shutdown, because he got less for border barriers than Democrats had offered last year. But beginning with a campaign rally he held Monday night on the border in El Paso, Texas, Mr. Trump has been telling supporters that the pain of the shutdown was necessary to make his point about the urgency of the border security crisis.
He said the shutdown was worth a temporary increase in the nation’s unemployment rate.
“We had a little blip [in the unemployment rate] because of a thing called the shutdown,” Mr. Trump said. “But remember this … if we didn’t do that shutdown, we would not have been able to show this country, these politicians, the world, what the hell is happening with the border.”
He added, “That was a very important thing we did.”
White House aides also noted that the agreement provides some money for border barriers, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had dismissively offered the president $1 for wall funding in testy talks during the shutdown.
Mrs. Pelosi was urging House Democrats to support the tentative agreement Wednesday.
“As with all compromises, I say to people, support the bill for what is in it,” Mrs. Pelosi told reporters. “Don’t judge it for what is not in it. We have other days to pass other legislation.”
With lawmakers rushing to avoid another shutdown, however, some of the president’s conservative allies were urging him to pack a short-term funding extension to provide more time to study the details of the deal.
“In politics trust is everything,” said Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government. “This president has no reason to trust that Speaker Pelosi did not insert trap language into the bill, and he would be wise to verify that the proposed legislation is free from language that would prevent meaningful action to address the crisis at the border. While everyone would like to see this drama finally come to an end, it is better to get it right than to regret signing the bill later.”

4100,Trump\xe2\x80\x99s immigration offer brings sharp reactions from Dems and GOP',Fox News (Online),1/20/2019,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-immigration-offer-brings-polarized-reactions-from-dems-and-gop,"President Trump’s immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown drew sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike.
In a televised White House address on Saturday afternoon, Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, in exchange for the $5.7 billion he has been seeking for a barrier along the nation's southern border with Mexico.
HOYER URGES TRUMP, MCCONNELL TO STOP HOLDING GOVERNMENT HOSTAGE
“Our immigration system should be a source of pride ... not a source of shame as it is all over the world,” Trump said in his plea.
The president’s proposal was met with disdain from an array of top Democratic lawmakers. Many used the same language in their critiques, accusing Trump of holding the government and federal workers ""hostage.""
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted, “What we didn’t hear from the President was any sympathy for the federal workers who face so much uncertainty because of the chaos of the #TrumpShutdown.”
Before Trump made his announcement, Pelosi had called his anticipated proposal “a non-starter.”
TRUMP OFFERS IMMIGRATION COMPROMISE
“For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports.”
For his part, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, called Trump's proposal ""one-sided and ineffective.""
""It's clear the President realizes that by closing the government and hurting so many American workers and their families, he has put himself and the country in an untenable position. Unfortunately, he keeps putting forward one-sided and ineffective remedies. There's only one way out: open the government, Mr. President, and then Democrats and Republicans can have a civil discussion and come up with bipartisan solutions.""
Schumer, D-N.Y., concluded, ""It was the President who single-handedly took away DACA and TPS protections in the first place – offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking.""
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer shared a similar sentiment, urging Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell to ""stop holding government hostage and end the shutdown"" immediately.
“The president must stop holding government hostage and end the shutdown so federal employees can get back to work serving the American people. There is no reason for Americans to be shut out of work and without a paycheck while negotiations take place on the best way to secure our borders,” he said.

Hoyer said negotiation can progress after the government reopens.
“With the government open, we can negotiate an agreement to strengthen border security that both sides can support and that is in the best interests of the American people.”
Another leading Dem, Sen. Kristen Gillibrand of New York, who announced her White House bid on Jan. 15 in an episode of ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" said Trump's offer was a ""bad deal.""
Gillibrand tweeted: ""Trump ordered the end of DACA and TPS. Then he shut down the government. Now he's holding federal workers hostage, saying he'll temporarily give back what he took away -- only if we give him a pointless, ineffective wall he falsely promised Mexico would pay for. This is a bad deal.""
Then there was New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez's response. He bluntly accused Trump of forcing ""a pointless shutdown"" to pay for the border wall.
""This is about more than 800,000 Americans who are being held hostage by a President who has forced a pointless shutdown to pay for an expensive, ineffective wall. This is not about immigration. Dreamers and TPS recipients are not bargaining chips. It's unacceptable that after taking away DACA protections, eliminating the TPS program for thousands of immigrants and creating a humanitarian crisis at the border, President Trump is offering temporary solutions in exchange for a permanent wall.""
The Democratic senator also said ""a legitimate negotiation"" can proceed after the government is reopened.
Fellow Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware slammed McConnell for refusing ""to meaningfully negotiate with Senate Democrats,"" but also called Trump's offer ""a first step toward comprehensive immigration reform.""
""This senseless government shutdown is hurting millions of Americans, and its impacts are only getting worse. The President should re-open the government so that Republicans and Democrats in Congress can work with the White House to find a sensible solution on border security and immigration. I am confident that a reasonable compromise can be reached, but not while President Trump continues to keep significant parts of the government shut down and Leader McConnell refuses to meaningfully negotiate with Senate Democrats,"" he said.
""Some relief for Dreamers and an extension of Temporary Protected Status represent a first step toward comprehensive immigration reform, but more ideas from members of both parties should be taken up and debated. Republicans and Democrats stand ready to work toward a solution, but the fact remains that there is no reason to have large parts of the federal government shut down while we debate appropriate border security and immigration policies.""
Republican lawmakers, at the opposite end of the reaction spectrum, praised the president for his willingness to negotiate.
Senate Majority Leader McConnell, for instance, commended the president ""for taking bipartisan steps toward addressing current immigration issues.""
In his statement, he said; “Compromise in divided government means that everyone can’t get everything they want every time. The president’s proposal reflects that. It strikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle.""
“This bill takes a bipartisan approach to re-opening the closed portions of the federal government. It pairs the border security investment that our nation needs with additional immigration measures that both Democrat and Republican members of Congress believe are necessary. Unlike the bills that have come from the House over the past few weeks, this proposal could actually resolve this impasse. It has the full support of the President and could be signed into law to quickly reopen the government.""
Republican Whip Steve Scalise called on Democrats to match Trump's willingness to negotiate.
""The time for political games has long passed. Democrats must put their personal dislike of the president aside, end their obstruction, and finally come to the negotiating table. It's time Democrats do what is right for the functioning and security of our nation and agree to a deal that opens our government, and includes funding for a border wall and other measures to solve this serious immigration crisis at our southern border,"" he said in a statement.
Also on the Republican side, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she was ""hopeful"" for a ""constructive debate"" with Democrats.
“Compromise is not a sign of weakness — it’s a sign of strength, particularly when hundreds of thousands of families are being harmed. The Administration, Senate Republicans, and Democrats must now resolve this stalemate before 800,000 federal workers and their families miss yet another paycheck, and our economy is further damaged,” she said.
Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whose views on the president and his policies have fluctuated, said Trump ""put forth a reasonable, good faith proposal that will reopen the government and help secure the border.""
He tweeted, ""I look forward to voting for it and will work to encourage my Republican and Democratic colleagues to do the same.
Earlier, while speaking in Ogden, Utah, Romney said he did not understand Pelosi's position on border security.
""You (Pelosi) and your fellow Democrats have voted for over 600 miles of border fence in the past, why won't you vote for another few miles now? I don't understand their position, I really don't,"" the Republican senator said.
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio took a positive view of Trump's proposed deal, like his fellow Republicans. He said Trump made ""a very reasonable offer"" and urged Democrats to work with him.
“The way to end this shutdown is for both sides to make mutual concessions in order to reach an agreement. The president has made a very reasonable offer to extend DACA and TPS protections in exchange for the border security measures he supports. I hope that instead of choosing the road of endless obstruction, Democrats will decide to work with him to reach an agreement and end the shutdown,” he said.
Likewise, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy called the president's immigration offer ""reasonable.""
McCarthy tweeted: ""President Trump has put forward a serious and reasonable offer to reform parts of our broken immigration system and reopen government. The moment now turns to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The country is watching.""

US President Donald Trump has attacked Democrats for rejecting his proposals to end the longest government shutdown in US history.
He said his plans had been dismissed before he had even presented them.
Mr Trump had offered ""compromises"" in exchange for funding for his security wall along the Mexican border, the issue that has caused the shutdown.
But Democrats called the proposals ""unacceptable"", a ""non-starter"" and ""hostage taking"".
There were two main offers in an address Mr Trump made on Saturday:
Some 700,000 so-called Dreamers, who were young when they entered the US illegally with their parents, would be protected for another three years
Some 300,000 people holding visas under Temporary Protection Status (TPS) would also get three years' protection. These are people who have fled countries affected by war or disasters
What is the latest from Mr Trump?
On Twitter, he said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats had ""turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak"".
He said his opponents ""don't see crime and drugs, they only see 2020 - which they are not going to win"".
A second tweet appeared aimed at the conservative right, which fears the offer he made on immigration would amount to an amnesty.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Five questions about Trump's border wall
He tweeted: ""No. Amnesty is not part of my offer."" He said he was only talking about a three-year extension and that an amnesty would ""be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else"".
Mr Trump also said he was not planning a ""big push to remove 11 million plus people"" in the US illegally, but added a warning to Ms Pelosi to ""be careful"" on that.
What did the Democrats say?
The target of Mr Trump's anger was a statement released by Ms Pelosi anticipating - and rejecting - the concessions before they were made.
She said the proposals were ""a non-starter"" and ""a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives"".

Senator Chuck Schumer said Mr Trump had previously ""single-handedly"" taken away Dreamer and TPS protections and that offering some protections back was ""not a compromise but more hostage taking"".
The Democrats insist they will not negotiate until government is reopened.
The party took over control of the House this year, while Mr Trump's Republicans still have a majority in the Senate. The federal budget funding would have to be agreed by both.
Opinion polls suggest most Americans blame Mr Trump more than the Democrats for the shutdown.
Shutdown likely to drag on
Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington
Donald Trump struck a deal to reopen the government and build his much-promised wall - with one small problem. He was negotiating with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, and if he wants to succeed he's going to have to get Democrats on board.
It's a touch ironic that the deal Mr Trump outlined - his wall in exchange for protection for certain childhood undocumented migrants and temporary resident aliens - was one the president walked away from last year, when Democrats were the ones instigating a shutdown.
After senators thought they had an agreement, the White House issued new demands for reforms to legal immigration. Now Democrats are in control of the House, and the calculus has changed. Mr Trump's offer of temporary immigrant protection probably isn't any greater than the ones courts have already imposed.
The president's move may put some pressure on his opponents to return to the negotiating table, but they still feel they have the upper hand. Unless that changes - or the president backs down - the shutdown will drag on.
How is the shutdown affecting unpaid workers?
Some of the 800,000 federal employees who have been going unpaid since 22 December are in increasingly dire straits as the shutdown enters its fifth week.

6890,"Democratic lawmakers reject Trump's latest immigration proposal""",CNN (Web News),1/20/2019,,,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/19/politics/trump-border-wall-shutdown-congress-reaction/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Democratic lawmakers on Saturday rejected President Donald Trump's proposal to extend some non-permanent protections for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients and individuals with Temporary Protected Status in exchange for border wall funding.
Trump floated the offer in an afternoon speech from the White House, however, Democrats see the lack of a permanent solution for the individuals impacted by these programs as a deal-breaker.
The plan Trump proposed also includes $800 million for urgent humanitarian assistance and $805 million for drug detection technology to secure ports of entry, as well as additional border agents, law enforcement officials and new immigration judge teams to deal with cases of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border.
But all of this is on the condition that he receives $5.7 billion for a border wall -- the central point of contention between Democrats and Republicans in the fight to re-open the government.
Statements from legislators rolled in following the President's announcement:
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi
Prior to Trump's speech, Pelosi, a California Democrat, issued a statement in response to ""initial reports"" that ""make clear that his proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives.""
Her statement continued: ""It is unlikely that any one of these provisions alone would pass the House, and taken together, they are a non-starter. For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports.""
Following Trump's speech, Pelosi tweeted, ""What is original in the President's proposal is not good. What is good in the proposal is not original. Democrats will vote next week to add additional border security funding for ports of entry, advanced technology for scanning vehicles for drugs & immigration judges.""
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
Republicans issued statements of support for the President's proposal, including McConnell, who said he intends to bring the legislation forward this week. He had declined earlier to bring forward spending bills Democrats passed in the House.
""I commend the President for his leadership in proposing this bold solution to reopen the government, secure the border, and take bipartisan steps toward addressing current immigration issues,"" McConnell said in a statement.
The Republican from Kentucky called the proposal a ""a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle.""
""This bill takes a bipartisan approach to re-opening the closed portions of the federal government. It pairs the border security investment that our nation needs with additional immigration measures that both Democrat and Republican members of Congress believe are necessary. Unlike the bills that have come from the House over the past few weeks, this proposal could actually resolve this impasse. It has the full support of the President and could be signed into law to quickly reopen the government,"" he continued.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer
Schumer, a New York Democrat, called the proposal ""more hostage taking.""
""It's clear the President realizes that by closing the government and hurting so many American workers and their families, he has put himself and the country in an untenable position,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, he keeps putting forward one-sided and ineffective remedies. There's only way out: open up the government, Mr. President, and then Democrats and Republicans can have a civil discussion and come up with bipartisan solutions.""
His statement continued: ""It was the President who singled-handedly took away DACA and TPS protections in the first place -- offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking.""
Sen. Marco Rubio
Rubio, a Florida Republican, also issued a statement in favor of Trump's latest offer.
""The way to end this shutdown is for both sides to make mutual concessions in order to reach an agreement. The President has made a very reasonable offer to extend DACA and TPS protections in exchange for the border security measures he supports. I hope that instead of choosing the road of endless obstruction, Democrats will decide to work with him to reach an agreement and end the shutdown,"" Rubio said in a statement.
Sen. Dick Durbin
The Illinois Democrat is the co-author of the BRIDGE Act, which is legislation aimed at extending protection for DACA recipients, and issued a statement also rejecting the President's proposal.
""First, President Trump and Senate Majority Leader McConnell must open the government today. Second, I cannot support the proposed offer as reported and do not believe it can pass the Senate. Third, I am ready to sit down at any time after the government is opened and work to resolve all outstanding issues,"" Durbin said.
Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine
The Virginia Democrats, who represent many thousands of government employees in their state next to Washington, DC, issued a joint statement criticizing the President for not acknowledging ""the pain and suffering"" he has caused to those affected by the shutdown and said the first step to immigration reform needs to include reopening the government.
""President Trump's remarks today failed to acknowledge the pain and suffering he has caused to federal workers, contractors, and millions of Americans with this unnecessary government shutdown, and his rhetoric toward immigrants was inflammatory and unproductive,"" the statement said.
It continued, ""​We would be glad to review, starting this week, any proposals he has to responsibly improve and increase border security and provide certainty to TPS recipients and DREAMers. To start this process, we have to immediately reopen the government.""
Sen. Joe Manchin
West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin weighed in on the President's announcement in a tweet on Saturday evening, saying he was ""hopeful"" that this proposal would allow the government to open soon."
4500,"Schumer: 'Trump is a terrible negotiator'""",Washington Times,1/4/2019,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jan/4/schumer-trump-terrible-negotiator/,"Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer begged Republicans Friday to break with President Trump and vote to reopen the government without new border wall money, saying the president doesn’t know how to negotiate.
The shot came just minutes before Democratic leaders were to be at the White House to meet with Mr. Trump — and it was a cut at the president’s own self-image as a masterful deal-maker.
“President Trump is a terrible negotiator,” Mr. Schumer said.
The government shutdown reached two weeks Friday, and there’s little sign it will end soon.
Senators aren’t holding votes Friday and are expected to be out of session over the weekend and Monday. When they return Tuesday night, they have other business in front of them.
The House late Thursday passed two bills to reopen nine departments that lost funding Dec. 22, but Mr. Trump has signaled he would veto them, and Senate Republican leaders have said they won’t give the bills floor time.

4866,McConnell Faces Pressure From Republicans to Stop Avoiding Shutdown Fight',New York Times (Online News),1/4/2019,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/us/politics/mcconnell-senate-republicans-shutdown.html,"Mr. McConnell, 76, is the longest-serving Senate Republican leader in history and is a wily tactician. While he is not generally considered vulnerable, his popularity is lagging at home. A poll by Western Kentucky University last spring found that only 30 percent of Kentuckians approve of his job performance. Sticking with Mr. Trump, whose approval ratings top 50 percent in Kentucky, is in his own political interest.
But if he wants to hang onto his job as majority leader, Mr. McConnell must also be mindful of the political fortunes of Republicans seeking re-election in states won by Mrs. Clinton in 2016 or by Democrats in November. A prolonged government shutdown is the last thing those lawmakers need. And even some Republicans up for re-election in states won by Mr. Trump, like Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, sound uneasy.
“A shutdown, in my view, is a no-win proposition,” Ms. Capito said, adding that she heard complaints from Transportation Security Administration workers as she was returning to Washington for the start of the new Congress this week. Ms. Capito is the chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security; the panel has already passed a bill funding the department, including $1.6 billion for border security including fencing — but with no money for Mr. Trump’s wall.
“It is just a lot of unneeded stress on a lot of people,” she said of the shutdown.
“I would like to see it resolved soon,” said Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, who also faces re-election in 2020. She repeated herself for emphasis: “I would like to see it resolved soon.”
For Mr. McConnell, the shutdown fight presents a dynamic that is likely to become familiar over the next two years, as House Democrats rush to pass long-sought liberal policies and, in many cases, try to use the chamber to highlight Republicans’ opposition to legislative changes they believe are overwhelmingly popular. Mr. McConnell has already been burned once, having negotiated and passed through the Senate a plan to avoid the shutdown in the first place only to have Mr. Trump pull his support at the last minute.
“He faces that reality now on every issue: What’s the White House going to do with this?” said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and Mr. Schumer’s No. 2. He predicted that Mr. McConnell’s approach — to simply stand in the way so that Mr. Trump is not forced to use his veto pen — would only change if Republican senators up for re-election begin to fear political costs of carrying the president’s water.
Senator John Cornyn of Texas, Mr. McConnell’s former No. 2, compared Mr. McConnell’s task to “threading a needle.” Mr. McConnell’s former chief of staff, Josh Holmes, said it was considerably more simple than that."
6738,"Trump, Democrats dig in ahead of meeting on government shutdown'",Reuters,1/4/2019,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shutdown/trump-democrats-dig-in-ahead-of-meeting-on-government-shutdown-idUSKCN1OY0D3,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump threatened to keep the U.S. government partially shut for months or years on Friday after he and Democratic leaders failed to resolve their dispute over Trump’s request for $5.6 billion to build a wall on the Mexican border.
After Democratic congressional leaders refused Trump’s requests at a meeting in the White House Situation Room, the Republican president threatened to take the controversial step of declaring a national emergency and building the wall without congressional approval.
Trump is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures money for the wall. As a result, around 800,000 public workers have been unpaid, with about a quarter of the federal government closed for two weeks.
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats had told Trump during the meeting to end the shutdown. “He resisted,” Schumer said. “In fact, he said he’d keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.”
Trump confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting, the first since a new era of divided government began when Democrats took control of the House of Representatives on Thursday.
“We had a very, very productive meeting, and we’ve come a long way,” Trump said.
According to a source familiar with the White House discussion, Trump opened the meeting with a speech that lasted at least 15 minutes in which he insisted on the need for billions of dollars to fund a border wall.
The source also said Trump brought up recent impeachment threats during those remarks, arguing that he had notched a strong performance as president and should not be a target for impeachment.
The president later told reporters that Nancy Pelosi, the new Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, said Democrats were not looking to impeach him.
NATIONAL EMERGENCY?
Raising the stakes in his tussle with the newly emboldened Democrats, Trump threatened extraordinary measures to build the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States.
A reporter asked Trump whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall.
“Yes, I have. And I can do it if I want,” Trump said. “We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country ... I may do it. But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly. And it’s another way of doing it. But if we can do it through a negotiated process, we’re giving that a shot.”
Emergency powers have been invoked by previous U.S. presidents during times of war.
Senator Jack Reed, the senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized the comments, saying in a statement, “Declaring a trumped up national emergency in order to skirt congressional approval is wrong.”
The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the power to fund the federal government, so Trump likely would face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall. Building a wall - and having Mexico pay for it - was one of Trump’s main promises when he ran for president in 2016.

Trump’s wall project is estimated to cost about $23 billion.
Democrats have called the wall immoral, ineffective and medieval.
Pelosi said Friday’s meeting with Trump was “sometimes contentious” but that they agreed to continue talking.
“But we recognize on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president,” she said.
Credit rating agency Moody’s said the shutdown will cause minimal U.S. economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial markets and the broad economy if the closure is protracted.
A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll last week showed that 50 percent of the public blames Trump for the shutdown and 7 percent blames Republican lawmakers, while 32 percent blames Democrats.
In a Dec. 11 meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, Trump said he would be “proud” to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame Democrats. He has since said they are responsible.
White House officials and congressional staffers will meet at 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT) on Saturday to try to end the impasse, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said.
House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters that Trump had named Vice President Mike Pence, senior aide Jared Kushner and Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen to work over the weekend.

“Border Security and the Wall ‘thing’ and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker!” Trump tweeted. “Let’s make a deal?”
Pelosi is poised to become speaker of the House when Democrats officially take back control of the chamber on Thursday. Trump’s comments come amid the news that House Democrats plan to introduce a legislative package to re-open the government on Thursday – though it is unclear whether Trump or Republicans in the Senate will go along with it.
Fox News has learned there is a briefing at the White House on Wednesday for the top two leaders of each party from each chamber for the new Congress to discuss the impasse.
The House Democratic plan will include one bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Feb. 8, with $1.3 billion for border security. It doesn't include money for the president's desired wall on the border.
Whether the Republican-led Senate, under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, will consider the bills — or if Trump would sign either into law — was unclear. McConnell spokesman Donald Stewart said Senate Republicans won't not take action without Trump's backing.
""It's simple: The Senate is not going to send something to the president that he won't sign,"" Stewart said.
Even if only symbolic, the passage of the bills in the House would put fresh pressure on the president.
Republicans and Democrats have been at a standstill over President Trump's demands for $5 billion to fund the border wall. Earlier Tuesday, the president ripped into Democrats for insisting they won’t fund a border wall.
“One thing has now been proven,” Trump tweeted. “The Democrats do not care about Open Borders and all of the crime and drugs that Open Borders bring!”
Negotiations over the partial government shutdown stalled over the holidays.
“Our negotiations are at an impasse at the moment,” Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday. “I wish it were not so.”
Funding for a slew of federal agencies lapsed at midnight on Dec. 22 – just days before Christmas -- after Congress and the White House failed to pass a spending package. Nine of 15 Cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies have closed, affecting about a quarter of the federal government.
With no resolution in sight, the shutdown is forcing hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors to stay home or work without pay. Museums and galleries popular with visitors and locals in the nation's capital will close starting midweek if the partial shutdown of the federal government drags on.

The president’s invitation, which was described by congressional sources as a briefing and not a negotiating session, was sent to the top two Democrats and Republicans in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.
Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office said he would attend the briefing, which is set for Wednesday. It was unclear whether the other leaders would participate, one source said.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the specifics of the briefing.
The House and Senate will reconvene briefly on Wednesday to mark the last day of the Republican-controlled 2017-2018 Congress, with no signs of a workable plan to end the shutdown, which is now in its second week.
About a quarter of the federal government is shut down, with roughly 800,000 workers affected.
Democrats, who won control of the House in the November elections, plan to approve on Thursday a two-part spending package meant to end the shutdown. But its prospects are grim in the Republican-led Senate, which previously approved similar measures on the floor or in committee but has since fallen in line with Trump’s demands for funding for the border wall.
The legislation will set the stage for the first major battle of the new Congress between House Democrats led by Nancy Pelosi and Senate Republicans led by McConnell.
“We are giving the Republicans the opportunity to take yes for an answer,” Pelosi, who is expected to be the House speaker, said in a letter to colleagues released by her office on Tuesday.
“Senate Republicans have already supported this legislation, and if they reject it now, they will be fully complicit in chaos and destruction of the president’s third shutdown of his term.”
Trump triggered the shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, by insisting that $5 billion in funding for the border wall be part of any spending measure.
“Border Security and the Wall ‘thing’ and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let’s make a deal?” Trump tweeted on Tuesday.
Trump calls the wall crucial to curbing illegal immigration, echoing his 2016 presidential campaign pledge. During his run for the White House, Trump insisted Mexico would pay for the wall.
The Democrats’ two-part spending package includes a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Feb. 8 and provide $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security items including technology and cameras.
The second part of the package would fund federal agencies that are now unfunded, such as the Justice, Commerce and Transportation departments, through Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year.
The House Democrats’ measure does not contain the $5 billion Trump wants in wall funding. McConnell has said Senate Republicans will not approve a spending measure not supported by Trump."

AD
House Democrats plan to use their new majority to vote through measures that would reopen nearly all of the shuttered federal agencies through the end of September, at funding levels Senate Republicans have previously agreed to. Those spending bills contain scores of priorities and pet projects for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.
AD
The Democratic proposal holds out one exception: The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border security, would keep its current level of funding, with no new money for a border wall. The plan would also extend the department’s budget only through Feb. 8, allowing Democrats to revisit funding for key parts of Trump’s immigration policy in a month.
“The President is using the government shutdown to try to force an expensive and ineffective wall upon the American people, but Democrats have offered two bills which separate the arguments over the wall from the government shutdown,” read a joint statement from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the likely next House speaker, and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).

Republican leaders would have the option to pass the bipartisan bills, reopening much of the government while the border fight continued, but doing so could diminish Trump’s leverage as he demands billions in taxpayer funding for a wall.
AD
On Monday, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the Senate, which will remain under Republican control, will bring up only legislation that has the president’s blessing.
“It’s simple: The Senate is not going to send something to the president that he won’t sign,” Don Stewart, McConnell’s spokesman, wrote in an email Monday.
The president has asked for $5 billion in border money, far beyond the $1.3 billion that Democrats plan to vote through this week. Trump on Monday invited Democrats to continue negotiations but reiterated that he had no plans to back down.

“They can come over right now, they could’ve come over anytime. I spent Christmas in the White House, I spent New Year’s Eve now in the White House. And you know, I’m here, I’m ready to go. It’s very important,” he said in an interview with Fox News that’s airing Monday evening during the network’s New Year’s Eve programming.
AD
“We are not giving up. We have to have border security, and the wall is a big part of border security,” he said.
Asked when he expects to meet with Schumer and Pelosi, Trump replied, “I assume when they get back.”
The White House did not comment Monday on House Democrats’ plan.
One of Trump’s close congressional allies, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), dismissed the proposal from Democrats.
AD
“Nancy Pelosi’s newest funding proposal doesn’t represent any serious attempt to secure our border or find a compromise,” Meadows wrote on Twitter, adding that the plan was “a non-starter and will not be a legitimate answer to this impasse.”
The deadlock has resulted in what is already the longest partial government shutdown since a 16-day standoff in 2013 over the Affordable Care Act.
Some 800,000 federal workers have been affected, with an estimated 350,000 furloughed at home and the others still working because their jobs are deemed “essential.” Thus far workers have not missed a paycheck, but that will begin to happen if the shutdown is not resolved soon. Many federal contractors are without work as well.

“The biggest reaction still remains anxiety: When will this end?” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D), whose Northern Virginia district is home to tens of thousands of federal workers. “Coupled with now the creeping reality of the financial consequences if this goes on too long, everything from ‘Can I pay rent on time?’ to ‘What kind of obligations, if any, can I incur while it’s uncertain whether I get a paycheck?’ ”
The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, representing some 700,000 workers, on Monday announced that it was suing the federal government over the shutdown, writing in a statement that “the federal government is violating the law by requiring some federal employees to work without pay during a shutdown.”
In an issue unrelated to the border wall but important to federal workers, the package of full-year bills that Democrats plan to pass would include a 1.9 percent raise for civilian workers that Trump has sought to deny.
AD

In December, Senate Republicans signed off on a plan that would have averted the shutdown but did not include new wall money, only to have Trump publicly denounce the proposal the next day. McConnell, who will remain in charge of the Senate in 2019 as the House flips to Democratic control, does not want to put his lawmakers in that position again.
The construction of a wall along the Mexican border was one of Trump’s top promises in the 2016 campaign and early in his presidency, and he vowed to make Mexico pay for it. More recently, he has asked for taxpayer money to build the wall and said Mexico will indirectly pay for it later, but his aides have struggled to explain how that will happen.
Pelosi, who is expected to be elected speaker this week, has called the wall “immoral” and said her new majority will not pay for it.

House Democrats settled on the approach of funding the Department of Homeland Security on a short-term basis after liberals objected to a proposal to fund the agency through the rest of the 2019 fiscal year, even without increasing spending at the border.
A coalition of advocacy groups, including the ACLU, sent Pelosi and Schumer a letter Friday opposing extending funding for the Department of Homeland Security for a full year, citing concerns that such an approach “clearly funds Trump’s wall project and must be rejected.”
A spokeswoman for the ACLU said Monday that the group supports extending Homeland Security funding to Feb. 8, which would allow newly empowered Democrats more latitude in determining the agency’s budget for the remainder of fiscal 2019.
AD
Trump canceled a planned trip to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., to stay in Washington to deal with the shutdown, but he has not been in touch with Democratic leaders. There have been no face-to-face negotiations since Vice President Pence and others held meetings at the Capitol on Dec. 22, the day the shutdown began. Pence made Democrats an offer that lowered proposed spending on the wall, but they rejected it in part because it included what they called a $400,000 “slush fund” that Trump could have spent on other immigration priorities.
AD
Despite Republicans holding a bigger majority in the Senate in the next Congress, some Democratic votes will still be needed to pass funding legislation there, and Democratic senators, even more moderate ones, have been resolute against money for a wall.
That much was clear soon after the November midterms, when Schumer started gauging where Democratic senators stood on $5 billion for a border wall through one-on-one conversations in his office. Repeatedly, Democratic senators told Schumer that they would support money for border security but not Trump’s specific request, according to a person familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe them.
The agencies affected by the shutdown make up about 25 percent of the portion of the federal government that is funded by Congress. The Pentagon is mostly not affected, since a spending bill for the military was passed by Congress and signed by Trump in 2018. Congress and the president also passed legislation to fund the Labor Department, the Health and Human Services Department and others, before Trump’s demands for wall money ground negotiations on other spending bills to a halt.
AD
Programs such as Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid also are unaffected, since their budgets proceed automatically, without the need for annual congressional appropriations. The Russia investigation of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III also is unaffected since it is paid for by a permanent, dedicated funding stream."
3371,"Dems' plan to end shutdown punts border battle into February""",Washington Times,12/31/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/dec/31/democrats-announce-plan-end-shutdown/,"Democrats announced a plan Monday to try to reopen the government by passing a package of Senate-written bills to fund most remaining parts of government for all of 2019, coupled with stopgap funding through Feb. 8 for Homeland Security.
That plan has repeatedly been rejected in principle by the White House, but Democrats, about to take control of the House when the new Congress convenes Thursday, say they’ll try to force action on it.
They said their goal was to separate Mr. Trump’s demand for a border wall from the ongoing government shutdown, reopening government while putting off a fight over homeland security’s budget for several weeks.
Rep. Nancy Pelosi, poised to become House speaker, and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, said senators have already voted for a Feb. 8 funding bill during votes two weeks ago.
“It would be the height of irresponsibility and political cynicism for Senate Republicans to now reject the same legislation they have already supported,” the leaders said.
Their hope is to isolate Mr. Trump, whose demand for border funding has sent the government into a generally painless shutdown.
While most of government is still operating, some 25 percent of discretionary money expired Dec. 21. The holidays have muted much of the impact, and some agencies continued to function on leftover money, postponing real effects for most Americans.

President Donald Trump’s Border Patrol chief on Sunday called the deaths of two Guatemalan children who perished while in government custody this month “absolutely devastating” and said immigration enforcement agents “did everything they could” to prevent the tragedies.
“Just absolutely devastating for us on every level. It’s been over a decade since we’ve had a child die anywhere in our processes,” Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said on ABC’s “This Week.”

“What I can tell you about these two cases — and I’ve looked at our operation reporting, the initial investigative reporting, I looked at the fathers’ statements and interviews — is that our agents did everything they could as soon as these children manifested symptoms of illness to save their lives,” McAleenan said.
Seven-year-old Jakelin Caal crossed the border with her father and a group of migrants on Dec. 6 before surrendering to Border Patrol personnel near Lordsburg, N.M. After she began experiencing seizures, Caal was flown to a hospital in El Paso, Texas, where she died two days later. The Washington Post reported that Caal died of dehydration .
Eight-year-old Felipe Gomez Alonzo was arrested with his father by immigration agents in El Paso on Dec. 18. He died late Christmas Eve at a New Mexico hospital after suffering coughing, vomiting and a fever, according to law enforcement. New Mexico authorities say an autopsy revealed the boy had the flu, according to The Associated Press.
McAleenan on Sunday said he and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen have directed border officials to perform medical checks of children ages 17 and under who are entering the immigration process, as well as those already in government custody.
“That’s not a capacity we’ve had in the past,” McAleenan said.
“We’re also trying to — to really change the system so that we have the capacity — either with doctors, physicians assistants, paramedics — to do an initial intake check so that we know if a child is healthy as they arrive at the border and then make sure they can get medical care if they need it,” he added.
McAleenan also said he has already allocated increased agency funding toward “medical care and mental health care for children entering our custody.”

Enlarge this image toggle caption Paul Ratje/AFP/Getty Images Paul Ratje/AFP/Getty Images
Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen traveled to Texas and Arizona on Friday and Saturday, citing an ""unprecedented"" increase in the apprehensions of families and unaccompanied children at the U.S.-Mexico border.
""The system is clearly overwhelmed,"" Nielsen said in a statement. Nearly 50,000 family units were caught by the U.S. Border Patrol in October and November, according to Department of Homeland Security data, a fourfold increase over the same period last year.
The secretary's visit comes as her department is under scrutiny for the recent deaths of two Guatemalan migrant children in U.S. custody. On Monday, 8-year old Felipe Gomez-Alonza died after coming down with the flu, and 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin died earlier this month of shock and dehydration. Nielsen's trip began in El Paso, Texas where Gomez-Alonza was apprehended, and where Maquin died.
Earlier this week, Nielsen called the 8-year old's death ""deeply concerning and heartbreaking"" and announced new medical screening procedures for all child migrants – both those travelling with family members and those who arrive unaccompanied. In El Paso, they are being examined at a network of hospitals and pop-up clinics staffed by volunteers. As of Friday, nearly 150 children had been screened under the new procedures and at least four had been admitted to an area hospital, according to the Border Regional Advisory Council, a non-profit that is helping coordinate the check-ups.
On Saturday, President Trump blamed Democrats for the two children's deaths.
Trump has repeatedly made unsupported claims about the dangers posed by incoming migrants; his controversial campaign-promise of a new border wall is at the center of congressional gridlock that has temporarily shuttered the federal government.
Without citing specific numbers, Nielsen said this week that there has been an increase in sick children crossing America's southern border. Alan Shapiro, a pediatrician who treats and advocates for immigrant children told Yahoo News that the claim is ""disingenuous"" adding that ""there's an uptick everywhere in the country of viral illnesses in winter. That's not specific to migrants.""
As NPR's Joel Rose has reported, bleak living conditions and a lack of sanitation inside government detention facilities can also make migrant children sick. A group of Democratic lawmakers say that when Congress returns to Washington, D.C., next week they will ""hold hearings and conduct oversight of the two deaths that occurred earlier this month, as well as the conditions under which thousands of children are being held in DHS custody.""
In El Paso on Friday, Nielsen met with the sector chief and staff at two border patrol stations, as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement leadership, and U.S. Coast Guard medical personnel who are advising the Border Patrol on new screening protocols.
Nielsen also had a conversation with the city's Republican mayor, Dee Margo, who welcomed her visit.
Margo told NPR that among the topics they discussed was the release of 400 migrants in downtown El Paso earlier this week by ICE officers. The move caught city officials and local aid agencies off-guard, as the migrants were left without food, shelter or a place to go. Margo dismissed the unexpected drop-off as a ""glitch.""
On Saturday morning, Nielsen continued her tour in Yuma, Ariz. Details of that visit were not immediately available.
Last week, Nielsen announced a new policy that will require asylum seekers at the southern border to wait in Mexico while their claims are processed. If it is implemented, more children will likely be housed in already-strained Mexican shelters, in areas where gangs routinely target migrants.

6325,Trump blames Democrats for deaths of migrant children at border',Washington Times,12/30/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/dec/29/donald-trump-blames-democrats-deaths-migrant-child/,"President Trump blamed congressional Democrats Saturday for the deaths of migrant children at the border, saying liberals’ “pathetic” immigration policies have encouraged foreign families to attempt the dangerous journey.
“Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “They can’t. If we had a Wall, they wouldn’t even try!”
House Democrats ordered Homeland Security officials this week to preserve all “evidence” related to the two deaths this month of Guatemalan children who jumped the U.S.-Mexico border with their parents, signaling an investigation next month.
An 8-year-old boy, Felipe Gomez Alonzo, died on Christmas Eve after six days in Border Patrol custody. He had been treated for a cold and fever at a hospital and was released, but was readmitted hours later — and died soon thereafter.
His mother in Guatemala said the boy’s father brought the child on the trip to the U.S. in the belief that gaining illegal entry would be easier with a child.
Earlier this month, a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died after being arrested for crossing the border illegally with her father. Border Patrol agents twice managed to revive her after she fell ill, but she later suffered a heart attack and liver and respiratory failure at a hospital.
Mr. Trump said the two children “were very sick before they were given over to Border Patrol.”
“The father of the young girl said it was not their fault, he hadn’t given her water in days,” the president tweeted. “Border Patrol needs the Wall and it will all end. They are working so hard & getting so little credit!”

""We build a wall or we close the southern border,"" he said in a series of Friday morning tweets.

Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney reiterated to reporters that Mr. Trump would be willing to shut down the border, saying ""yes"" when asked if the president meant what he said in his tweets. CBS has estimated that closing the southern border would cost up to $1 billion a day.

Still, as the partial government shutdown enters day seven, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told ""CBS This Morning"" Friday that Mr. Trump is ""willing to negotiate"" with Democrats on the $5 billion he is requesting to fund the wall.
Sanders blasted Democrats for the standoff that is now expected to keep roughly 800,000 federal workers from receiving paychecks into the New Year, claiming they have ""left the table altogether"" but not offering details on what the president might be willing to agree to.
""I'm not going to negotiate in the press, but the president has been willing to negotiate on this point and the Democrats have not been willing to do anything,"" Sanders said. ""It's a very sad day when we can't get Democrats to even show up for work and sit down with us and have these conversations and try to help make real solutions and get something done.""
Mulvaney also said negotiations have completely shut down, and repeated Sanders' argument that Democrats were more interested in protecting Nancy Pelosi's speakership than the border. Because of this, he said, they did not expect anything substantive until she was elected speaker by Democrat majority on January 3.
Mr. Trump, for his part, plans to stay in Washington in the coming days. Sanders told reporters that ""there are no plans as of now"" for the president to travel to his resort at Mar-a-Lago. The president had been expected at the Florida resort for New Year's Eve."
2502,"Trump threatens to close border, terminate trade deals, cut aid unless wall is funded'",Fox News (Online),12/28/2018,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-threatens-to-close-border-terminate-trade-deals-cut-aid-unless-wall-is-funded,"President Trump warned Friday that if Democrats do not agree to his demands to fund a wall on the southern border, he will “close the Southern border entirely” and cut aid to Central American countries -- while pulling back on trade with Mexico.
“We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,” he tweeted Friday morning. “Hard to believe there was a Congress & President who would approve!”
The tweetstorm came amid the partial government shutdown that will soon enter its second week. The closures began last Saturday after Republicans and Democrats were unable to agree on a funding package that would keep the government open and fund Trump’s promised border wall. Trump has demanded $5 billion for the barrier, but Democrats have refused, instead offering $1.3 billion for general border security.

With both sides refusing to budge and little activity on Capitol Hill amid the holiday break, there are no signs of the impasse ending anytime soon. One member of the House Republican leadership told Fox News on Thursday that a resolution may not emerge until the new year.
But on Friday, Trump not only renewed his demands for the wall, but threatened numerous consequences in the absence of that money. He even suggested pulling back on the recently renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which now goes by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
“The United States looses [sic] soooo much money on Trade with Mexico under NAFTA, over 75 Billion Dollars a year (not including Drug Money which would be many times that amount), that I would consider closing the Southern Border a 'profit making operation,'"" he tweeted.
“Bring our car industry back into the United States where it belongs. Go back to pre-NAFTA, before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to Mexico,” he carried on. “Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border.”
He then said the U.S. would terminate aid with Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, which he said are doing “nothing for the United States but taking our money,” and referred to reports that another caravan of migrants hoping to get to the U.S. is planning on leaving Honduras in January.
“Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it. We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!” he said.
Trump has previously threatened to shut down the border, but took no action to do so following those threats. He also previously threatened to cut aid to countries that assist, or do nothing to stop, the caravans. But earlier this month, the U.S. pledged a total of $10.6 billion in aid and investment for Central America and southern Mexico -- as part of a push to promote better security and job opportunities so that Central Americans and Mexicans do not have to emigrate to the U.S.
NIELSEN ANNOUNCES DEAL WITH MEXICO TO OVERHAUL ASYLUM PROCESS, COMBAT 'CATCH AND RELEASE'
A cut-off of trade relations with Mexico could also risk a new agreement that DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced this month that calls for immigrants claiming asylum in the U.S. to be returned to Mexico as their cases are processed.
Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s incoming acting chief of staff, claimed Friday on “Fox & Friends” that it appeared Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is interested in a deal but Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi is preventing it. He alleged Democrats are not dealing because Pelosi is waiting until she secures the speakership.
“We don’t think they will [negotiate] until after the new Congress is sworn in,” he said.
But Pelosi has denied claims they haven't provided a counteroffer.
""Democrats have offered Republicans three options to re-open government that all include funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security – but not the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall,"" said Drew Hammill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff. ""With the House Majority, Democrats will act swiftly to end the Trump Shutdown, and will fight for a strategic, robust national security policy, including strong and smart border security, and strong support for our servicemembers and veterans.""

5252,"Donald Trump, venting fury over budget fight, threatens to close U.S.-Mexico border'",USA TODAY,12/28/2018,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/28/donald-trump-threatens-close-u-s-mexico-border/2430052002/,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump threatened Friday to close the U.S. border with Mexico if Democrats keep opposing funding for his proposed wall, but he did not spell out how he would carry out such a policy or its broader impact.
""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" Trump tweeted.
Trump has made the threat before but has not offered details. Illegal crossings are at the heart of his dispute with congressional Democrats over funding for a proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
It's also uncertain how closing the border would affect migration. Many people seeking to enter the United States claim political asylum, and the government is required to consider those requests regardless of border closures.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that in November ""51,856 people were apprehended between ports of entry on the Southwest Border.""
There were an estimated 10.7 million undocumented immigrants already living in the United States in 2016, a 12-year low, according to the most recent statistics compiled by the Pew Research Center.
The partial government shutdown began after Trump refused to endorse a temporary spending bill because it lacked full funding for the border wall. Senate Democrats, meanwhile, blocked a revised plan that included wall money, describing Trump's barrier as an unnecessary waste of money that has now caused a temporary government shutdown.
""This isn't about security. It's Trump trying to get taxpayers to fund what Mexico won't – a monument to him at the border,"" said Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson. ""He's taken taxpayers hostage, and now he's upping the ransom demands.""
Trump tweeted amid signs that the partial government shutdown that began a week ago will likely go on into the new year and the new Congress.
House and Senate leaders have said no votes are scheduled in the near term.
The new Congress is scheduled to convene Jan. 3, including a new Democratic majority in the House.
In an interview with USA TODAY this week, incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats have no plans to support Trump's wall funding. She said the president is using fact-free ""scare tactics"" to stump for his wall, and has frequently changed his demands.
""First of all, the fact ... that he says, ‘we're going to build a wall with cement, and Mexico's going to pay for it’ while he's already backed off of the cement,"" Pelosi said. ""Now he's down to, I think, a beaded curtain or something, I'm not sure where he is.""
In a Friday morning tweet storm, Trump appeared to argue that closing the southern border would improve U.S. trade with Mexico, even though a full closure would presumably curtail the movement of goods and services over the border.
In November, U.S. officials closed the San Ysidro border crossing near San Diego, California, for five hours following a confrontation between migrants and U.S. authorities. The San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce later estimated a one-day loss of $5.3 million for more than 700 local businesses.
Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, said Trump could be talking about closing formal ports of entry like the one at San Ysidro. The government is already trying to harden the many areas between formal ports of entry,
""We're doing everything we can between points of entry,"" Pierce said.
In his tweets, Trump also again said he would consider cutting foreign aid to countries he claims are not doing enough to stop migration, specifically citing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
Reiterating his threat, Trump said in one post: ""Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border.""
In October, just a few weeks before pivotal congressional elections, Trump threatened to close the southern border.
""I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!"" he wrote on Twitter.
Mexican officials have said they are trying to work with U.S. officials to keep asylum seekers in Mexico until their claims move through U.S. courts.
Trump also threatened to close the border – ""permanently if need be"" – in a tweet on Nov. 26, weeks after elections in which Democrats won control of the U.S. House and as the wall funding dispute was building."
4833,"DHS begs for help, orders full review after second migrant child's death""",Washington Times,12/26/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/dec/26/dhs-begs-help-orders-full-review-after-second-migr/,"Border officials begged for medical help from the Coast Guard and the Pentagon to screen illegal immigrants and asked American and Mexican disease specialists to investigate a surge of sick migrants caught at the border after another illegal immigrant child died in U.S. custody.
Every juvenile currently held by U.S. Customs and Border Protection is being rechecked for health issues, and a review of CBP procedures is underway, authorities said after the death on Christmas Eve.
This one involved an 8-year-old boy who jumped the border with his father on Dec. 18. They had been shuttled to four CBP facilities and one hospital in the six days before the boy’s death.
CBP said more than two dozen “welfare checks” were performed during those six days and it wasn’t until the final day that the boy showed any problems. He was treated at a hospital and released just hours before falling ill again, and he died soon after he was readmitted.
“This is a tragic loss,” CBP Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan said in a statement late Tuesday. “Our deepest sympathies go out to the family.”
The death has fueled an already raging debate over CBP’s handling of the surge of illegal immigrant families that is straining Homeland Security’s abilities. Democrats in Congress and immigrant rights activists across the country have said the blood of children is on the government’s hands and insist that bad policies and poor attitudes have contributed to the deaths.
A 7-year-old girl arrived at the border this month in remote New Mexico with her father, and it took some time to get her to a processing facility. En route, she began vomiting and then stopped breathing. Agents managed to revive her twice, but she died a day later at a hospital after suffering liver and respiratory failure and a heart attack.
Administration officials say a long, rough journey through Mexico must have compromised the girl’s health and she was in U.S. custody for mere hours.
The latest case is tougher to wave away.
Guatemalan officials said Tuesday that the father insisted the boy was healthy when they arrived and were arrested as part of a group of migrants just west of El Paso, Texas, in the early afternoon of Dec. 18.
Homeland Security officials, though, said they have seen a rise in the number of ill migrants crossing the border and that “dozens of people a day” in Border Patrol facilities need medical treatment.
“It is now clear that migrants, particularly children, are increasingly facing medical challenges and harboring illness caused by their long and dangerous journey,” Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement.
She said she has asked the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to look into the cases and has asked Mexican authorities to investigate shelters south of the border where migrants from Central America hole up while waiting for the OK from smugglers to attempt to cross.
Homeland Security officials said those shelters are likely causes of the spread of disease.
In the case of the boy who died this week, authorities said they spotted signs of flu and took him to a hospital, where he was tested for strep throat. A common cold was diagnosed, and the boy was given Tylenol. While being held for observation, he ran a fever of 103 degrees. Amoxicillin and ibuprofen were prescribed, and the boy was released.
He later vomited, but his father refused more medical attention and said the boy’s health was improving. Hours later, a Border Patrol agent said the boy had “glossy eyes.” While he was being transported back to Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center, he vomited again and lost consciousness, officials said.
He was declared dead a little more than 40 minutes later.
Congressional Democrats vowed to investigate when they take control of the House next year.
“It is incumbent upon Congress to ask serious questions about what happened and who bears responsibility,” said Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat who is poised to become majority leader.
An internal CBP review is underway for the deaths of the girl and the boy this month, and the Homeland Security inspector general has announced an investigation into the girl’s death.
A Homeland Security official said deaths of children in CBP custody are rare and that none had been reported for a decade.
Officials suggested that the problem lay south of the border. Smugglers are encouraging a surge of migrants — particularly families with young children — to make the trip from Central America to the U.S. The migrants are convinced they can take advantage of lax policies to gain an illegal foothold in the U.S.
“Our system has been pushed to a breaking point by those who seek open borders. Smugglers, traffickers and their own parents put these minors at risk by embarking on the dangerous and arduous journey north,” Ms. Nielsen said.
Department officials said they have been pleading with Congress to change laws to cut down on abuses of the asylum process and to allow illegal immigrant families to be held in detention, which would make it easier to deport them.
If Central Americans fail to enter the U.S., then relatives and neighbors would be discouraged from making the trip, the government hopes.
The Obama administration took the same approach in 2014 and 2015 to deal with a surge of families, but it has drawn far more outrage this time.
A Homeland Security official who briefed reporters Wednesday — but would not allow himself to be identified — said it’s time for action.
“We have been sounding the alarm on this for months, and we’ve been seeking additional support, action, from Congress and the courts to deal with this. We have yet to see that assistance,” the official said. “We have been doing all we can under our authorities to handle this strain.”
The department released a timeline of events in the latest death beginning with the early-afternoon arrest Dec. 18 as part of a group of migrants snared just west of the El Paso border crossing.
The migrants were kept in the field for more than three hours, said CBP, blaming the difficulty of finding transportation.
By late afternoon, the migrants were at an initial processing center, where they were given food and water and were kept for two days. They were transported to another CBP facility, where they stayed for another two nights.
Between those two locations, they were given 23 welfare checks. During these checks, agents give visual examinations and ask whether the migrants need anything or whether anything is wrong.
On Sunday, because of overcrowding at the El Paso facility, the group of migrants was transported to a facility in New Mexico. On Monday — six days after the arrests — CBP contacted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for a more permanent placement.
Just hours later on the morning of Christmas Eve, an agent noticed the boy coughing and reported that he had “glossy eyes.” Half an hour later, the boy was taken to a hospital for a flu check.
After his release in the middle of the afternoon, the boy was sent to a temporary facility at a Border Patrol checkpoint, where he had a meal and was given a dose of the medications.
At 7 p.m., still at the checkpoint, the boy vomited. Agents cleaned up the vomit but said the father refused further medical assistance.
At 10 p.m., the child was observed to be lethargic. Because no agent on duty had emergency medical skills, the boy was taken back to the hospital. He vomited and lost consciousness in the hour between the emergence of his condition and his arrival at the hospital. He was pronounced dead about 40 minutes after arrival.

6298,"The final days of Felipe Alonzo-Gomez, the 8-year-old migrant who died in US custody'",CNN (Web News),12/26/2018,,,https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/26/us/cbp-timeline-guatemala-boy-dies/index.html,"(CNN) An 8-year-old migrant's last days were a blur of border patrol stations and hospital visits in a location about 2,000 miles from his family's home in Guatemala.
The boy's death while in the custody of US Customs and Border Protection comes just weeks after a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died while being held by CBP. He was identified as Felipe Alonzo-Gomez by US Rep. Joaquin Castro, but CBP did not name him.
The children's deaths have highlighted the life-and-death challenges that migrants face in attempting to come to the US and caused CBP to announce several policy changes around its care of children under 10 years old.
CBP released the following timeline based on the current understanding of Felipe's final days and the hours leading up to his death late Christmas Eve. The dates and times below are in local time.
December 18
About 1 p.m.
Felipe was apprehended with his father at a location about 3 miles west of the Paso Del Norte port of entry in El Paso, Texas for illegal entry.
That apprehension location is a less than 15-minute drive from the Paso Del Norte port, but groups may be detained in the field until transportation is available.
4:39 p.m.
Felipe and his father were transferred to the Paso Del Norte processing center. While detained there, they were provided hot food, snacks, juice, and water, and the agents logged six welfare checks.
December 20
Noon
Felipe and his father were transferred to El Paso Border Patrol Station.
Over the next two days, Felipe and his father were provided with showers, food, juice, and water, and the agents logged 17 welfare checks.
December 22
11:17 p.m.
Border Patrol transferred Felipe and his father to the Alamogordo Border Patrol Station in Alamogordo, New Mexico to finalize processing. They were transferred because of capacity levels at the El Paso station.
Alamogordo is about 80 miles away from the El Paso station.
December 23
1:08 a.m.
Felipe and his father arrived at the Alamogordo Station. Upon arrival, they were provided with personal hygiene products and meals, and they received several welfare checks.
December 24
5:39 a.m.
A placement request for Felipe and his father was emailed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Enforcement and Removal Operations.
9 a.m.
A processing agent noticed that the child was coughing and appeared to have glossy eyes. About 30 minutes later, based on the agents' observations, Felipe was transferred to Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center in Alamogordo with possible influenza symptoms. He was accompanied by his father.
11:30 a.m.
Hospital staff conducted several tests on Felipe for strep throat.
12:45 p.m.
Felipe was given a diagnosis of common cold and given Tylenol.

He was evaluated for release and found to have a 103 degree fever and was held for continued observation.
2:50 p.m.
Felipe was released from the emergency room with a prescription for Ibuprofen and amoxicillin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic.
He and his father were transported to temporary holding at the Highway 70 checkpoint. While at the checkpoint, Felipe and his father were offered and accepted a hot meal.
About 5 p.m.
Agents provided Felipe with a dose of the prescribed medication as ordered by the medical staff, and agents conducted several welfare checks that evening.
7 p.m.
Felipe appeared to be nauseous and vomited. Agents were aware of this and helped clean up the vomit. His father declined further medical assistance as the child had been feeling better.
10 p.m.
Felipe appeared lethargic and nauseous again.
Because no EMT was on duty, out of caution, agents made the decision to return Felipe and his father to Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center.
During transportation to the hospital, he began to vomit and lost consciousness.
11:07 p.m.
Radio traffic indicated that the agent had arrived at the medical center, where he was met by hospital staff.
11:48 p.m.
Hospital staff were unable to revive Felipe and pronounced him dead.
December 25
7:40 a.m.
The Guatemalan Consulate was contacted about the child's death. His father is currently detained at the Alamogordo Station pending transfer to ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. He has spoken to his spouse in Guatemala and the Guatemalan Consulate.
4:01 p.m.
The Guatemalan Foreign Ministry issues a statement that it was alerted to a minor's death in the US. Guatemala's Consul General in Phoenix. Oscar Padilla Lam traveled to Alamogordo to meet with the boy's father to ""hear his version of the facts,"" according to the statement.
The Foreign Ministry said it will provide all assistance and consular protection to the boy's father and assume responsibility for the repatriation of the boy's remains."
3152,Medical checks ordered for all kids held in US custody after death of 2nd immigrant child this month',USA TODAY,12/26/2018,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/12/26/guatemalan-boy-death-medical-checks-immigrant-children-custody/2413058002/,"Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen on Wednesday called the death on Christmas Eve of an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy in federal detention a ""deeply concerning and heartbreaking"" tragedy and cited U.S. immigration system failings for a growing border crisis.
The top Trump administration border security official spoke out after directing a series of actions to care for undocumented immigrants taken into custody after illegal Mexican-U.S. crossings. The moves include U.S. Customs and Border Protection medical exams for all children it holds in custody.
The statement and actions marked the latest federal response to the death of the boy identified by Guatemalan officials as Felipe Gómez Alonzo. He was pronounced dead at 11:48 p.m. MST on Monday after he fell ill while held in CBP custody with his father, Agustín Gomez.
Felipe was the second immigrant child to die while in federal detention this month.
In a statement to the El Paso Times, BorderRAC Executive Director Wanda Helgesen said that as of Wednesday morning, 450 minors had been screened at regional medical facilities in the Border Patrol's El Paso sector, which includes New Mexico.
Details on the specific number of migrant patients at each facility were not available late Wednesday.
Nielsen's formal statement cited a recent jump in illegal border crossings by immigrant families and unaccompanied children. CBP apprehensions in those categories rose 86 percent – more than 68,000 family units and almost 14,000 unaccompanied children – over last year’s totals for the most recent two months along the Southwest border, she said.
""Our system has been pushed to a breaking point by those who seek open borders. Smugglers, traffickers and their own parents put these minors at risk by embarking on the dangerous and arduous journey north,"" Nielsen said.
""This crisis is exacerbated by the increase in persons who are entering our custody suffering from severe respiratory illnesses or exhibit some other illness upon apprehension,"" she said. ""Given the remote locations of their illegal crossing and the lack of resources, it is even more difficult for our personnel to be first responders.""
Nielsen said the changing immigration dynamic has been spurred by ""an immigration system that rewards parents for sending their children across the border alone,"" without requiring the adults to face ""consequences for their actions.""
She cited an asylum process that’s unable to provide swift help for qualified applicants and an immigration system that encourages fraudulent claims by border crossers. She noted nine of 10 asylum applications get rejected by immigration judges.
Nielsen said she contacted Mexican border officials to seek an investigation into ""the cause of these illnesses on their side of the border and to provide medical assistance in shelters as needed.""
She planned a trip to CBP patrol stations this week to review medical screenings and conditions – conditions that have spurred questions and criticism among some Democrats.
The updated health testing directed by Nielsen marks a change in the handling of young children detained after entering the USA without required documentation and comes amid a partial shutdown of the federal government over President Donald Trump's demand for $5 billion to build a security wall at the nation's southern border with Mexico.
CBP said Tuesday night that it started secondary medical checks beyond initial border screening on all children in custody. More than 95 percent of those children had been re-examined by paramedics, emergency medical technicians or medical facilities near the border, the officials said Wednesday.
In a background phone briefing Wednesday, the officials said CBP is considering options from other federal agencies to help provide increased medical assistance for young immigrants at the border. Along with support from the U.S. Coast Guard, assistance could come from the Department of Defense, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services.
The CBP update included a timetable of events leading to the latest death. It showed that the boy and his father had been in custody since Dec. 18.
A CBP agent noticed that the boy ""was coughing and appeared to have glossy eyes"" at approximately 9 a.m. MST on Monday. Taken with his father to a hospital in Alamogordo, New Mexico, he was diagnosed with a cold and a fever, prescribed amoxicillin and Ibuprofen and was released Monday afternoon after being held 90 minutes for observation, CBP said.
The boy was returned to the hospital Monday evening with nausea and vomiting and died hours later, CBP said. The hospital – the Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center – declined to comment Tuesday, citing privacy regulations.
The federal officials on Wednesday declined to discuss the hospital's earlier decision to release Felipe. Such decisions are left to medical professionals and are not made by CBP, they said.
“This is a tragic loss,"" CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said in a written statement. ""On behalf of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, our deepest sympathies go out to the family.""
The official cause of the boy's death had not immediately been determined, pending results of an autopsy. CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility and the Office of Inspector General will conduct a review, the officials said.
CBP asked the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to seek potential causes for a recent increase in the number of migrants in U.S. border areas who require medical aid. CBP personnel have transported ""dozens"" of people per day to hospitals for care in recent months, the officials said.
An official headcount on the number of immigrant children in CBP custody was not immediately available. The officials estimated Wednesday that families with children and unaccompanied immigrant children accounted for 1,400 to 1,500 of the roughly 2,100 people who are apprehended or detained at border areas each day.
Oscar Padilla, the Guatemalan consul in Phoenix, said Felipe's father told him the two had traveled to the USA from their home in Nentón, a village about 280 miles from Guatemala City. They planned to go to Johnson City, Tennessee. The consul identified the 47-year-old father and said he remains in U.S. Border Patrol custody.
The Border Patrol apprehended the father and son Dec. 18 for illegal entry, about 3 miles west of the Paso Del Norte Port of Entry in El Paso, Texas. Agents detained them at that port's processing center, logging six welfare checks until Thursday when they moved them to the El Paso Border Patrol Station.
There, the agency said it logged an additional 17 welfare checks before transferring them to Alamogordo Station on Sunday to finalize processing because of capacity levels at El Paso.
Agents conducted several welfare checks in Alamogordo before a processing agent noticed Felipe's symptoms at 9 a.m. local time Monday. At all three places where the father and son were detained, they were given food and drinks, as well as showers or personal hygiene products at the last two stations, CBP said.
Felipe's death represents an ""incredibly rare"" tragedy, the federal officials said Wednesday. Six people have died in CBP custody in 2018, Nielsen said.

The second death of a child this month reignited criticism of the federal government’s handling of migrant children and their families.
The incoming chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, offered his condolences to the family and called for an investigation.
""The Administration’s policy of turning people away from legal ports of entry, otherwise known as metering, is putting families and children in great danger,"" Castro said in a statement. ""With two deaths that we know about just in the last few weeks, Congress will continue to press the Department of Homeland Security until we get answers to all our questions.”
Alamogordo, where the boy died, is about 90 miles from the U.S.-Mexican border at El Paso. Ruben Garcia, director of El Paso’s Annunciation House, said Tuesday that he had no reason to believe his shelter had served the family but was waiting for further details about what happened.
A spokeswoman for U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., whose district along the U.S.-Mexican border includes Alamogordo, could not be reached Tuesday.
Xochitl Torres Small, a Democrat who will represent the House district starting in January, called for a thorough and transparent investigation into the children’s deaths and medical resources along the border.
She said she had not personally inspected the holding area at the CBP checkpoint between Las Cruces and Alamogordo, where Felipe was held in between hospital visits. Nonetheless, Torres Small said, she worried that conditions in such facilities ""could be exacerbating illnesses.""
Alluding to overcrowding and hygiene, she said it is critical that CBP determine the best way to transport a sick child, how to ensure availability of medical personnel to give evaluations and how to allow people to take a shower.
The previous migrant child who died in government custody was Jakelin Caal, 7, a Guatemalan girl. She died Dec. 8 in El Paso after being apprehended by border agents.
Jakelin and her father crossed the border in New Mexico on Dec. 6, along with 161 other migrants. They were scheduled to travel by bus to the Lordsburg Border Patrol station in New Mexico when her father, Nery Gilberto Caal, told Border Patrol agents she was sick. She was transported to a children's hospital in El Paso where she died.
The White House said it had no responsibility in the ""horrible, tragic"" situation.
CBP, which did not notify Congress about Jakelin's death for days, said it would follow new procedures when someone dies in its custody. The protocol, including notification of federal lawmakers within 24 hours of any death, was followed after Felipe died, federal officials said Wednesday.
Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., expressed dismay over Tuesday's passing of the 8-year-old boy. In a tweet to Nielsen, Correa wrote, “This is the second child in a month. What is going on at @DHSgov? Does @HouseHomeland have to start subpoenaing you to get the truth?”
Other Democrats responded with criticism of border policies, including Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico.
""Heartbroken and sickened by this news,"" Heinrich said on Twitter. ""I am urgently demanding more details, but the Trump administration must be held accountable for this child’s death and all the lives they have put in danger with their intentional chaos and disregard for human life.""
Several critics said the death was especially troubling during the Christmas holiday season.
""The news of another child death in CBP custody is heartbreaking,"" Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., tweeted. ""We must demand a full and thorough account of what happened to this 8-year-old boy.""
""Tragic news this Christmas Day,"" Rep. Nanette Barragán, D-Calif., remarked on Twitter. ""Another death of a child in CBP custody? This is unacceptable. It is not ok that children are dying, that they are separated from their parents and don’t receive proper medical screenings and treatment. Congress must act. Real oversight coming 1/3.""

5146,Trump warns of a \xe2\x80\x98very long\xe2\x80\x99 government shutdown if Democrats oppose bill that includes border wall money',Washington Post,12/21/2018,,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-leans-on-mcconnell-to-pass-spending-bill-with-border-funding-in-senate/2018/12/21/31bb453a-0517-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html,"The shutdown intensifies a standoff between Trump, who is demanding $5.7 billion for a border wall, and congressional Democrats, who have vowed to block any wall funding and have the votes to do so. It marks a deflating final chapter for Republicans as they complete two years of unified GOP control in Washington — as well as an acrimonious prelude to the upcoming era of divided government, after Democrats take the House in January.
AD

Trump saw the final days of this year as his last chance to try to extract funding for the wall, while Democrats, united against the wall and buttressed by big wins in the midterm elections, showed no signs of buckling to his demands amid a flurry of attacks this week.
The White House and congressional leaders continued negotiations late Friday, but by 8:30 p.m., the House and the Senate had adjourned for the night. That made it impossible to vote on any spending agreement until Saturday, and it remained unclear whether any deal would materialize by then.
It is unclear how long a shutdown might last. Trump predicted earlier Friday that it could drag on for a “very long time.”
AD
About two hours before the shutdown was set to take effect, Trump distributed a video on Twitter in which he blamed Democrats but expressed hope that the lapse in government funding would be brief.

“We’re going to have a shutdown,” he said. “There’s nothing we can do about that because we need the Democrats to give us their votes. . . . Let’s be bipartisan, and let’s get it done. The shutdown hopefully will not last long.”
The Senate on Friday considered legislation to fund the government agencies through Feb. 8 and appropriate $5.7 billion to build 215 miles of wall structures along the Mexico border.
The House passed that legislation Thursday evening, but Senate Democrats successfully unified on Friday and refused to back that measure.
AD
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Friday that Democrats were open to talks with the White House and Republicans but would not agree to any measure that funded the construction of a new border wall.
Schumer said Friday that the Senate had unanimously agreed to a spending bill earlier in the week and accused Trump of having a “temper tantrum” because he wasn’t getting money for the wall.
AD
“President Trump, you will not get your wall,” Schumer said. “You’re not getting your wall today, next week or on Jan. 3 when Democrats take control of the House.”
Democrats tried to make clear to the White House for weeks that they had the votes to block any measure that contained money for the wall.
AD
As their power became clear to White House officials, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders signaled Tuesday that Trump was planning to withdraw his request for the funds in an effort to keep the government open.
But he received a torrent of criticism from conservative lawmakers and commentators following this decision, and he reversed course on Thursday, scuttling a temporary, bipartisan spending bill that would have extended funding through Feb. 8 but did not contain wall money.
Trump on Friday urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to change long-standing Senate rules to pass the House’s measure providing $5.7 billion for the wall. McConnell refused, making it impossible for Senate Republicans to push the measure through because Democrats control 49 seats in the 100-member chamber.
AD

“We’re going to be working very hard to get something passed in the Senate,” Trump said earlier Friday in the Oval Office. “Now it’s up to the Democrats as to whether or not we have a shutdown tonight. I hope we don’t, but we’ve very much prepared for a long shutdown.”
Republicans were frustrated by the reversal, and Democrats warned Friday that the president’s erratic and unvetted decisions in recent days were unsettling financial markets, foreign allies and even members of his Cabinet.
“This is tyranny of talk radio hosts, right? And so, how do you deal with that?” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn). “You have two talk radio hosts who completely flipped the president. And so, do we succumb to tyranny of talk radio hosts?”

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis announced his resignation Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average had one of its worst weeks in recent decades and has fallen almost 4,400 points, or 16 percent, since October.

Multiple federal parks and monuments are slated to close, some as soon as Saturday morning. The Securities and Exchange Commission posted a list of the services it will soon suspend, including the processing of certain business records. The Justice Department, Commerce Department and Internal Revenue Service are preparing to send thousands of workers home without pay.
And Trump’s prediction that a shutdown would last “for a very long time” meant that hundreds of thousands of federal employees risk missing at least one paycheck. Even the Border Patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration officials who are directed to continue working during the shutdown will not be paid until Congress funds their agencies.
AD
About 400,000 federal workers would be furloughed, according to a Washington Post projection. But a number of federal agencies, including the Pentagon, will not be directly affected, because Congress already passed multiple other spending bills this year that secured funding through September.
AD
As the funding lapse lengthens, the negotiations will prove to be a major test for Trump, Schumer, McConnell and House conservatives as they jostle for footing in Washington’s new power structure.
Friday afternoon saw a flurry of discussions begin in the afternoon when McConnell, Democrats and Vice President Pence began huddling separately in the Capitol.
AD
Pence separately joined Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney for a meeting with House conservatives. But the talks yielded no clear evidence of progress, and eventually Pence and his entourage left the Capitol.
“We don’t have a deal,” Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) told reporters after emerging from a late meeting with the vice president. “There are a lot of moving parts, and we’re trying to get them moving together.”
AD
The construction of a wall along the border with Mexico was one of Trump’s top campaign promises in 2016, and he had promised that Mexico would finance the entire project. But since taking office, he has demanded the money from Congress.
Senate Democrats have blocked every attempt so far. Trump has also threatened to shut the government down numerous times if he doesn’t get money for the border wall, but before Friday night, he had always backed down.
In recent days, Trump has tried a number of different tactics to try to secure the money. He called on Cabinet secretaries to search their budgets for extra funds, and on Wednesday, he said the entire project would be built by the military. But by Thursday he was back to demanding that Congress provide the funding, leaving many GOP lawmakers scrambling to accede to his demands.
AD
The shutdown followed a day of posturing and unsuccessful negotiations in the Senate on Friday.
After meeting with Trump at the White House, McConnell called a vote aimed at advancing the bill with $5.7 billion for the border wall, saying the legislation would not be considered controversial in more normal times.
“I’m proud to vote for it,” McConnell said.
But after hours of maneuvering, it was clear that the legislation would not command the support needed to pass, although the Senate advanced it on a procedural vote — with Pence breaking a tie — to keep a legislative vehicle alive in case a deal does emerge.
Trump, meanwhile, ratcheted up public pressure on Democrats to cave on the wall.
In a spate of morning Twitter posts, Trump sought to pin blame on Democrats for a potential shutdown, even though he said last week that he would accept responsibility for a shutdown.
“The Democrats, whose votes we need in the Senate, will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED,” Trump wrote. “If the Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. People don’t want Open Borders and Crime!”
But Democrats showed no signs of relenting, and on Friday night, they continued to blame Trump and the Republicans for the partial shutdown.
“I think we ought to make it clear that it’s the president’s abrupt change in position and refusal to accept the deal he’s already told his leadership he’d accept,” said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.).
“Look, this is the last week we have a Republican-controlled Senate and House and White House — they’ve got to work this out.”"

Conservatives in the House had also rejected the measure, arguing to their leaders that it would be nearly impossible to secure wall funding after Democrats take back the House majority in January.

Trump’s tweet came moments after White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Fox News explicitly that the White House wants the Senate to end the filibuster.
“The Senate has a constitutional duty and a constitutional authority to actually protect our country. We can’t be a sovereign country if we don’t have borders and we don’t have protection of the American citizens,” Sanders declared.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2018
This option was originally thought to be untenable in the Senate because it could not garner the necessary 60 votes. All legislation that passes the upper chamber of Congress must have 60 votes of support in order to clear a filibuster-proof majority. The Senate, however, reserves the ability to remake its own rules and end the historical filibuster.
Trump’s instruction for McConnell may, however, fall on deaf ears with the senate leader promising in 2017 that he would never end the filibuster in order to advance legislation.
“There’s not a single senator in the majority who thinks we ought to change the legislative filibuster,” McConnell declared in 2017. “Not one.”"
4787,"Trump demands wall funding, increasing threat of U.S. government shutdown'",Reuters,12/20/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-budget/trump-balks-at-government-funding-bill-raising-shutdown-fears-idUSKCN1OJ188,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday added $5 billion to a government spending bill to help President Donald Trump make good on a pledge to build a border wall, a move that made a partial federal government shutdown more likely this weekend.
The Senate is highly unlikely to pass the legislation, which funds agencies responsible for federal law enforcement activities, airport security screenings, space exploration and farm programs, by a midnight deadline on Friday.
Trump had said he would not sign a Senate-passed bill to keep the government running through Feb. 8 because it lacked funds for the wall, a signature promise of his 2016 run for office, so Republicans in the House of Representatives scrambled to add money to appease the president.
Trump demanded $5 billion to put toward a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico that he argues is needed to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, a down payment on a massive project which Democrats have rejected as ineffective and wasteful.
“The bill that’s on the floor of the House, everyone knows will not pass the Senate,” Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters ahead of the vote.
The funding uncertainty weighed on markets on Thursday but it was later dwarfed by another bombshell from the Trump administration: the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
Trump, who accused Democrats of playing politics with the border wall, has said he sees it as a winning issue for his 2020 re-election campaign. Last week in a White House meeting with Democratic congressional leaders, he said he would be “proud to shut down the government for border security.”
“I’ve made my position very clear. Any measure that funds the government must include border security,” Trump said at a White House event.

The House-passed bill also includes $7.8 billion in aid for states hit by recent natural disasters.
The Senate had approved a bill late Wednesday that extended existing funds for agencies for seven weeks, punting the funding issue into the next Congress.
But hard-right conservative pundits and lawmakers urged Trump to push for border wall funding now, even if it leads to a shutdown, arguing that it would be impossible to get once Democrats take control of the House on Jan. 3.
“It’s really about a president that is not willing to fold without a fight,” Republican Representative Mark Meadows said in an interview on Fox News.
The Senate will look at the House-passed bill on Friday afternoon but would need support from Democrats to vote quickly on it. Most senators had already left Washington for the Christmas break.

Trump also had planned to leave for a vacation at his private resort in Florida, but the White House said he would not go in the event of a shutdown.
During his 2016 campaign, Trump repeatedly said Mexico would pay for the border wall but never specified how. Last week he said that a new trade deal his administration had negotiated with Mexico and Canada would generate enough savings to be equivalent to Mexico financing the wall.
The issue of money for the wall also led to a partial government shutdown during a weekend in January, and a second funding gap in February lasted only a few hours. Impact on government services was negligible in both cases.
In a 2013 shutdown, conservative Republicans made an unsuccessful effort to use funding bills to repeal President Barack Obama’s healthcare law."

The Democrats aren’t going to get away with holding the federal government hostage to their radical open-borders agenda. Not again.
The Democrats know that they got the Republicans to cave during the previous budget impasse, which produced a bloated $1.3 trillion Omnibus spending bill that didn’t fund construction of the border wall. President Trump reluctantly signed that bill, but he did so with a vow that he would never again put his signature on such a bad piece of legislation.
“As a matter of National Security I've signed the Omnibus Spending Bill. I say to Congress: I will NEVER sign another bill like this again,” the President declared in March. “To prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all govt spending bills!”
He made his position even more clear in July, pledging to fix the country’s broken immigration system even if it requires a shutdown.
“I don’t care what the political ramifications are, our immigration laws and border security have been a complete and total disaster for decades, and there is no way that the Democrats will allow it to be fixed without a Government Shutdown,” he tweeted. “Border Security is National Security, and National Security is the long-term viability of our Country. A Government Shutdown is a very small price to pay for a safe and Prosperous America!”
Prior to the last budget impasse, President Trump offered congressional Democrats a surprisingly generous deal, offering to accept legal status for nearly a million DACA recipients in exchange for funding of the border wall. True to form, though, the obstructionist Democrats rejected the President’s good-faith overture, even though the $5 billion he requested for the wall would have accounted for less than 0.004 percent of the amount Congress ended up appropriating.
Now, with a partial government shutdown looming if a deal to fund seven government agencies can’t be concluded by December 21, President Trump has a perfect opportunity to follow through on his pledge while finally getting the border wall funding he has sought since the beginning of his presidency.
Senate Democrats insist that they will not accept more than $1.6 billion for border security, and they’re threatening to punish the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), if the President doesn’t capitulate.
In order to get their way, the Democrats will do everything in their power to portray a potential partial government shutdown as a national catastrophe, but that’s just more fearmongering intended to manipulate the public and the press.
In reality, about two-thirds of the federal government is already funded through a budget deal reached earlier in the year, so a partial shutdown would not affect most federal employees, including those serving in the armed forces. In fact, it’s entirely possible that the showdown will only involve DHS funding because of the political drama over immigration, since Congress could fund the other six agencies separately.
Even if DHS were temporarily left without funding, though, it would not materially impact border security, because Border Patrol and ICE agents would almost certainly still be required to report for work. They would not be able to receive paychecks until a funding deal could be reached, but history shows that this would only be a temporary problem, since Congress has always appropriated back pay for employees affected by previous shutdowns.
The Democrats are a party of con artists and fear mongers, but President Trump is no fool. He knows that a border wall is essential to our national security, and he’s not going to give up on that urgent priority in the interest of political expediency.

4329,The House is scrambling to avoid a partial shutdown after Trump throws negotiations into chaos',Vox,12/20/2018,,,https://www.vox.com/2018/12/20/18150263/house-republicans-trump-border-wall-government-shutdown,"With the Senate rejecting a House spending bill that included money for President Trump’s border wall, the federal government looks headed for a shutdown at midnight.
The Senate declined to even vote on a short-term spending package containing $5 billion of wall funding that the House passed Thursday, knowing it could not get the 60 votes needed. President Donald Trump’s sudden refusal to sign anything without wall funding has thrown Congress into a tailspin with just hours to go until a shutdown.
The president sent a series of confrontational tweets on Friday morning urging Mitch McConnell to hold a vote on a funding bill sure to fail. Then he urged the Senate Majority Leader to “go nuclear” and abandon Senate rules to get it done, an idea McConnell rejected.
At issue is Trump’s red line on $5 billion for a border wall, something Democrats universally oppose. The Republican-controlled House passed a bill that includes the $5 billion, but the Senate, which needs Democrats and Republicans to pass anything needing 60 votes, is set to reject it. The Senate has already passed a bipartisan “clean” bill to fund the government into February — without the border money attached.
Democrats take control of the House in less than two weeks, after which it would be much harder for Trump to get his money approved.
Trump had previously supported the clean-bill plan, but did an about-face on Thursday after pressure from conservatives. With no clear direction on what Trump would be willing to sign, Congressional leaders are essentially going back to the drawing board.
“There is no path forward for the House bill,” Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) said on the Senate floor Friday night. “What I wanted to do with not proceeding is demonstrate that not all Republicans would be for the House bill either.”
Republican and Democratic leaders of both chambers will now have to hash out a deal with Trump, the person who created the two-day long crisis by going back on his word that he would sign a short-term spending bill even if it didn’t contain funding for his wall. Trump is staying in DC for the holidays, but we don’t yet know how long these negotiations will take.
What we do know is the government is definitely shutting down — at least for some period of time.
What happened Friday
On Friday afternoon, the Senate voted on a motion on whether to take up the House bill including the $5 billion in funding for Trump’s border wall. But they never made it to the final vote.
Senators of both parties spent Friday scrambling to find a solution to the impasse. At one point, Vice President Mike Pence, incoming Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and senior adviser Jared Kushner paid a visit to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and then to House Republicans to try to strike a deal. Ultimately, it was to no avail.
The Senate passed a short-term spending bill on Wednesday which kept border security funding at current levels, but the House passed a different version that added in the $5 billion in border wall funding the president wanted.
Trump had seemed to be willing to sign the Senate’s “clean” spending bill earlier this week, but sharply changed course. The result is that parts of the government are set to shut down at midnight unless there is a dramatic breakthrough. (This bill impacts 25 percent of the government, the other 75 percent is already funded.)
On Friday morning, Trump blamed Democrats for the potential government shutdown and said it could “last for a very long time.”
The Democrats, whose votes we need in the Senate, will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED. If the Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. People don’t want Open Borders and Crime! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2018
The president’s focus on Senate passage of the border wall money has even prompted him to call on the upper chamber to use the “nuclear option,” which would blow up Senate rules so that the spending bill would only require a simple majority to pass, instead of the current 60 votes that it needs. (Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already rejected this idea.)
How this could end
The working assumption that if the government shuts down, it will one day reopen.
At the very least, Democrats will retake the House in January and could pass a new version of the clean Senate bill, which Trump would be forced to sign or veto.
Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (who is poised to become the next speaker) have made it clear they won’t agree to $5 billion of border wall funding. The question now is whether they will consider a lower sum for border security, potentially in exchange for a deal on immigration reform.
Right now, the number being thrown around is $1.6 billion in border security, but negotiations will likely keep going tonight and possibly through the weekend.
Because whatever bill comes up to the Senate needs 60 votes, which means some Democrats need to support it. Democrats know they have leverage here, and they will surely demand some concessions (like they have in the past regarding protections for DACA recipients) in exchange.
And Trump has motivation to get this done before January 3, when the House will change hands and a new Democratic majority that will not cater to his whims takes power.
What will be open and closed during a shutdown
Since roughly three-quarters of the government has been funded by existing bills, many services are set to remain intact in the case of a partial shutdown. Other programs that have been classified as “essential” will keep running as well, although some government entities like museums could see wholesale closures.
Hundreds of thousands of government employees could also be furloughed for the duration of the shutdown, though they would likely receive back pay after the fact. Here’s a list of what will and won’t be affected:
What’s still running
Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid
Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are all slated to keep up their operations uninterrupted. All three programs fall under “mandatory spending” that the federal government has committed to and are not affected by the annual appropriations process. (Medicaid also relies, in part, on state spending.)
New applicants for these programs might face a wait, however.
The US Postal Service
Post offices will remain operational and mail delivery will continue. As Rachel Wolfe has written for Vox, the USPS is funded by independent sources of revenue, including the sales of products and services — so it’s not impacted by any kind of shutdown.
Veterans hospitals and benefits
The Department of Veterans Affairs has already secured its funding, so veterans hospitals will maintain their routine operations.
Veteran disability pay and GI Bill benefits are funded by their own legislation separate from the annual appropriations bills, so those would stay consistent, according to Military.com.
Food stamps
People will still be able to get food stamps and subsidized lunches, at least in the short term. But it depends on how long the shutdown lasts: In the past, the Department of Agriculture has only had limited funding to maintain them without newly approved appropriations.
The military
Active-duty members of the military are exempt from shutdown furloughs, according to a contingency plan for the Department of Homeland Security. In the past, Congress has needed to pass separate legislation to ensure that members of the military are paid in a timely fashion during shutdowns. Otherwise they could potentially see delays in their pay depending on if the shutdown extends past a certain payment cycle.
The Mueller investigation
While special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference and the Trump campaign is under the purview of the Department of Justice, it will not be affected by any appropriations stalemate since it has its own permanent source of funding, CNN reports.
Border Patrol
Border security is at the heart of the shutdown fight, and a key chunk of the staffing for it is on track to remain intact even in the face of a partial shutdown involving DHS funding. US Customs and Border Protection is classified as an “essential” service, so a majority of its employees are exempt from furloughs during the shutdown — though they could encounter lags in pay.
As Bloomberg reports, “the overwhelming majority of border patrol, emergency management and immigration enforcement staff would be able to keep doing their jobs, though with their pay delayed.”
Air traffic control and TSA
Air traffic controllers, who fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Aviation Administration (which is under the Transportation Department umbrella), are deemed “essential” and will keep working during a partial shutdown.
Similarly, Transportation Service Administration agents are also considered “essential,” so airline travel is not expected to see disruptions on this front, according to USA Today.
The federal judiciary
The judiciary is able to maintain operations for a short period of time after funding runs out by using money it’s gathered from various courts-related fees including “funds derived from court filings,” according to the Congressional Research Service.
In 2018, the judiciary said it had the wherewithal to keep its operations open for about three weeks, notes CRS.
Washington, DC
The city now has more autonomy over its budget and should be able to maintain most of its services, despite ties to federal appropriations.
During the 2013 shutdown, city officials had to scramble to ensure that DC had the money it needed to remain operational, but since then, Congress has approved measures to insulate the impact on the city in the event of a shutdown.
What could be affected by a partial shutdown
Every agency has its own contingency plan set up in case of a shutdown, and there are a couple of key bodies, including the IRS and National Parks, that could see some pauses or breaks in service. Additionally, as MarketWatch points out, the president has the ability to determine whether any service is “essential” or not — so it’s possible he could try to shut down a key government function like air traffic control if he really wanted to make a point.
National parks
National parks, which are funded as part of the Interior Department, have long been one of the most visible government entities affected by a shutdown and that could happen again this time around. During last January’s shutdown, many national parks were still open to visitors, but they had limited staffing and closed access to various park facilities, including restrooms. It’s possible we could see a repeat of this arrangement.
Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo have previously been closed during shutdowns and would likely be shuttered again since they derive their funding from the Interior Department.
The IRS
A key body under the Treasury Department, the IRS has indicated that it plans to furlough a significant fraction of its workers under a contingency plan, since tax season has yet to get underway.
State Department services
People will still be able to obtain passports and visas, although the State Department could stop issuing them if those services are offered in buildings run by another agency that is shut down, Bloomberg reports.

5167,Stephen Miller says Trump is \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely\xe2\x80\x9d willing to shut down the government over border wall funding',Vox,12/17/2018,,,https://www.vox.com/2018/12/16/18143347/stephen-miller-trump-government-shutdown-border-wall-funding,"The Trump administration has continued its public fight over the border wall, with White House senior adviser Stephen Miller telling CBS that President Donald Trump is “absolutely” willing to shut down the government on December 21 if Congress refuses to authorize funding for his wall.
Echoing Trump’s own sentiments from Tuesday’s fiery Oval Office debate, Miller told CBS’s Margaret Brennan on Sunday’s Face the Nation that Trump would do “whatever is necessary” — including allowing a partial government shutdown.
“If it comes to it, absolutely. This is a very fundamental issue,” he said. “At stake is the question of whether or not the United States remains a sovereign country. Whether or not we can establish and enforce rules for entrance into our country.”
Miller’s comments come after a very tense, very public week of funding negotiations: A televised White House meeting between Trump, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Tuesday ended with the president saying he would be “proud” to shut down the government over their refusal to allocate $5 billion in wall funding (the total cost of the wall ranges from $20 billion to $70 billion). “If we don’t get what we want one way or another. ... I will shut down the government,” Trump said.
Schumer held equally firm on NBC’s Meet the Press Sunday, telling Chuck Todd that Trump is “not going to get the wall in any form.”
“We should not let a temper tantrum, threats, push us in the direction of doing something even our Republicans colleagues know is wrong,” the New York Democrat said.
On Face the Nation, Miller implied that refusing to fund the border wall was the same thing as advocating for illegal immigration, saying that Democrats have “a simple choice” between fighting for America’s working class and promoting illegal immigration. There is already $1.6 billion proposed for border security funding — it’s just a number on which Democrats seem unwilling to budge.
Will the government shut down over a couple billion in wall funding?
Trump has already signed a number of government spending bills into law. But Congress is staring down another partial government shutdown deadline on December 21: Seven department spending bills still need to be voted on, and funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which has purview over construction projects on the border, has proven to be the major sticking point.
Democrats have been unwilling to meet Trump’s $5 billion border wall demands, while Trump has been unwilling to offer them anything — other than not shutting down the government.
It’s not the first time Trump has threatened to shut down the government over his border wall — he also threatened a shutdown over summer, although that never went ahead. This shutdown would be the third under Trump; previous shutdowns occurred because Democrats wanted to force a larger Senate debate on immigration and because Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) was mad about government spending.
It’s not clear if the president and his emissaries are serious or simply posturing this time around.
The Trump administration has been threatening this shutdown for a while now, with White House counselor Kellyanne Conway telling Fox & Friends last month that Trump “is keeping all options open,” when asked about the possibility of a shutdown.
But as Ezra Klein pointed out after the Trump-Pelosi-Schumer showdown, Trump doesn’t actually want the wall as much as he wants a reality show-style fight over it:
[I]t’s the winning, not the wall, that drives him. It’s showing his supporters he’s fighting for them that powers his presidency, not actually getting anything done. Tuesday’s Oval Office meeting was meant to give Trump what he at least thinks he wants — not the wall, but a fight over the wall.
The White House chose to send Miller, a hardline immigration opponent, out to talk on Sunday — and he delivered a hard line (plus some good television)."
6812,"Americans' message to Washington on the looming shutdown: Don't""",USA TODAY,12/17/2018,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/17/poll-americans-blame-trump-gop-shutdown-over-wall-dispute/2334326002/,"WASHINGTON – Americans have a clear message to Washington as the government hurtles toward a partial shutdown Friday: Don't.
By a double-digit margin, 54 percent to 29 percent, those surveyed in a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll say they oppose the shutdown that President Donald Trump threatened if Congress doesn't agree to his demand for $5 billion in funding for a border wall.
Who would bear the blame?
By nearly 2-1, Americans would blame Trump and the Republicans, not congressional Democrats. Forty-three percent would blame the president and the GOP, while 24 percent would hold congressional Democrats responsible. Thirty percent would blame both sides equally.
""Completely, it's Donald Trump's fault,"" says Dave Dobrin, 60, a retired computer programmer from Orange County, California, who was among those surveyed. A political independent, he voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. ""He has the emotional maturity of a 6-year-old, and he is going to have a tantrum if he doesn't get his way.""
Dwayne Pyle, 33, a Republican who voted for Trump, says the need for a wall to secure the southern border is crucial, and he blames Democrats for refusing to cooperate with the president. ""We hired him to do a job,"" says Pyle of Redding, California, who works in sewer-line maintenance. ""We didn't hire him to make everybody happy or appease people.""

There is, unsurprisingly, a sharp partisan divide in attitudes toward the shutdown.
Democrats are almost all opposed to it, 83 percent to 6 percent. Independents are also overwhelmingly against the idea, 56 percent to 22 percent. Two-thirds of Republicans support a shutdown; one in five oppose it.
The blame game also has a partisan cast.
Democrats (81 percent of them) place the blame on Republicans. Republicans (58 percent of them) place the blame on Democrats. Independents (43 percent of them) place more blame on both parties equally than on either individually.
The nationwide survey of 1,000 registered voters, taken by landline and cellphone Tuesday through Sunday, has a margin of error of +/-3 percentage points.
The partial shutdown, which would begin three days before Christmas, would be the third since Trump took office two years ago.

There seems to be no clear plan to avoid the shutdown that looms at midnight Friday for the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies. Trump declared at a White House meeting with Democratic congressional leaders last week that he would be ""proud"" to take responsibility for shutting down the government if Congress refused to approve the funding he wants for a wall.

That proposal almost certainly can't command the 60 votes it would need to pass the Senate. Even approval in the Republican-controlled House isn't assured.
Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called on Republicans to persuade Trump to back down. ""They just have to have the guts to tell President Trump he's off the deep end here and all he is going to get with his temper tantrum is a shutdown,"" Schumer said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""He will not get a wall.""
Stephen Miller, a senior White House aide, showed no signs of compromise. ""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" he said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Including a shutdown? ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

But the White House contends American citizens are already suffering — with or without a shutdown — because of the rise in illegal immigration.
The two sides showed no sign of willingness to compromise Sunday, with just four days left to broker an agreement before the federal government partially shuts down.
“We should not let a temper tantrum — threats — push us in the direction of doing something even our Republican colleagues know is wrong,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer told NBC.
The New York Democrat said Republicans in Congress “have to have the guts” to tell the president he’s wrong for refusing to fund the government unless he gets $5 billion for his border wall.
“President Trump should understand there are not the votes for the wall in the House or the Senate. He is not going to get the wall in any form,” he said.
And the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Rep. Elijah Cummings, Maryland Democrat, said voters want the government to help them, not hurt them, suggesting a shutdown will politically damage Republicans.
“Whenever I hear a president say to the American people at Christmastime, ‘I am going to shut down your government,’ it pains me because I know it’s going to make a bad Christmas for a lot of people,” he told CNN.
But White House adviser Stephen Miller said Mr. Trump will do “whatever is necessary” to get the money to build the border wall.
“They can either choose to fight for Americans — working class — or to promote illegal immigration. You can’t do both,” Mr. Miller said of Democrats in an interview Sunday with CBS.
Congress is running up against a Friday deadline to finish funding the government, with several news reports suggesting they may look to a short-term “continuing resolution” that funds the government at current levels to get them past the holidays and into the new year.
Sen. Susan Collins, Maine Republican, told ABC she wants to see lawmakers take up a proposal that provided $2.5 billion this year and over the next 10 years for border security, which would fund a border fence, increase technology and patrol agents along the southern border.
“There is absolutely no excuse to shut down government on this issue or any issue. I have suggested we revisit a compromise proposal we brought forward earlier this year,” she said on Sunday, breaking with her party’s leader.
House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Mr. Schumer have offered Mr. Trump two other options, and they both include some money — roughly $1.3 billion — for the wall.
But it remains unclear whether the president will accept any compromise after his televised stand off with the two Democratic leaders in the Oval Office last week, where he demanded the $5 billion and claimed he isn’t afraid to shut down the government.
“I am proud to shut down the government for border security,” Mr. Trump said.

3886,Trump Throws Down With Pelosi and Schumer Over Border Wall: \xe2\x80\x98I Am Proud to Shut Down the Government\xe2\x80\x99',Daily Beast,12/11/2018,,,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-schumer-pelosi-devolve-into-shouting-match-during-oval-office-meeting,"President Donald Trump threatened to shut down the government during a heated argument with Democratic congressional leaders in the Oval Office on Tuesday in a remarkable display of partisan bickering just 10 days before a partial shutdown is set to take effect.
“I am proud to shut down the government for border security,” Trump said bluntly. “I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I’m not going to blame you for it. The last time you shut it down, it didn’t work. I will take the mantle of shutting down. And I’m going to shut it down for border security.”
The remark came during an extraordinary 15-minute on-camera argument that began with Trump insisting that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) should help him fund a border wall. Trump has asked for $5 billion in border-security funding, but Democrats have said $1.6 billion is their red line.
At first, both leaders sat silently listening to Trump read dubious figures and repeat falsehoods about how much of the wall has already been built. When Pelosi reminded the president that he does not have enough votes in the House to fund it, the president pivoted and began boasting about his party’s electoral gains in the Senate.
“When the president brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he’s in real trouble,” Schumer said with a laugh.
“I did!” Trump shot back.
An exasperated Pelosi repeated to Trump that he does not have enough votes among House Republicans alone to fully fund a border wall, and Trump responded by saying he needs 60 votes in the Senate, where Republicans have just a 51-to-49 majority, to get anything to his desk.
“The fact is, you do not have the votes in the House,” Pelosi said, to which Trump insisted: “Nancy, I do.”
Schumer then confronted Trump directly over his exaggerations and mistruths about the border wall.
“We have a lot of disagreements here. The Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of Pinocchios because they say you constantly misstate how much of the wall is built,” a defiant Schumer said. “You have called 20 times to shut down the government. You say, ‘I want to shut down the government.’ We don’t. We want to come to an agreement.”
At one point, Trump jabbed at Pelosi, saying, “Nancy’s in a situation where it’s not easy for her to talk right now.”
Pelosi fired back immediately, telling the president, “Please don’t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as leader of the House Democrats who just won a big victory.”
After the meeting, Schumer vented about the president’s tone during the sit-down. “This temper tantrum that he seems to throw will not get him his wall,” he said.
The partisan jabbing, which came during a photo opportunity before Trump was set to negotiate with Pelosi and Schumer behind closed doors, represented a preview of what to expect with a divided government next year, when Democrats officially take control of the House of Representatives.
“Unfortunately, this has spiraled downward when we came at a place to say, how do we meet the needs of the American people,” Pelosi said.
During the tense exchanges, Vice President Mike Pence sat stoically next to Trump and remained silent.
After the meeting, some Republicans began rallying behind the president. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a Trump ally, tweeted, “Great job sticking to your guns on border security, Mr. President! You are right to want more border security funding including Wall money. They are WRONG to say no.”"

The 15-minute meeting between the political opponents started cordially, but it ran off the rails after Pelosi warned that Trump's hard-line position on the wall would lead to a ""Trump shutdown.""
""I think the American people recognize that we must keep the government open, that a shutdown is not worth anything,"" Pelosi told Trump in the Oval Office Tuesday. ""And that you should not have a 'Trump shutdown.'""
""A what? Did you say a 'Trump shutdown?'"" Trump asked Pelosi.
""You have the White House. You have the Senate. You have the House of Representatives. You have the votes. You should pass it [a government funding bill] right now,"" Pelosi said.
""I can't get it passed in the House if it is not going to pass in the Senate,"" Trump fired back. ""The House we can get passed very easily. ... The problem is the Senate. We need 10 Democrats to vote and they aren't going to do it.""
Pelosi said that House Republicans don't have the votes to pass a bill that both funds the government and provides funding for the border wall. Pelosi argued that if they did, they would put such a bill on the floor.
""There are not votes — a majority of votes — for a wall,"" Pelosi told Trump.
""That's exactly right,"" Schumer echoed.
""If I needed the votes for the wall in the House, I would have them in one session. It would be done,"" Trump replied. ""It doesn't help to take that vote. I need 10 senators. That is the problem. ... We need the wall. More importantly, we need border security of which the wall is just a piece.""
Trump then offered the floor to Schumer, who immediately pointed out that the president has made some misleading statements about the wall.
""The Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of Pinochios because they say you constantly misstate how much of the wall is built,"" Schumer said in his opening remarks. He also said Trump doesn't want an agreement, but simply wants to shut down the government.
""We have a disagreement about the wall,"" Schumer said. ""We do not want to shutdown the government. You have called 20 times to shut down the government ... We don't. We want to come to an agreement.""
Pelosi at one point lamented that the meeting had turned into a public feud, and asked the the rest of the discussion be held without being observed by the press.

But the president instead took questions. In response to one question, Trump argued the wall is inextricably linked to his border security plans.
""You can't have good border security without the wall,"" Trump said.
""That is just not true,"" Pelosi interrupted as Schumer shook his head in approval of her retort.
""That is a political promise,"" Pelosi said of the wall. ""Border security is a way to effectively honor our responsibility.""
""We have to find a way to do border security without a wall, which is wasteful and doesn't solve the problem,"" Schumer added.
""It totally solves the problem and it is very important,"" Trump replied.
Trump ended the public part of the negotiation by saying he would be happy to shut down the government if it means he can secure funding for ""border security.""
""We need border security. That is what we are talking about border security,"" the president said towards the end of the argument. ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security.""
The president is asking Congress to approve $5 billion in border wall funding before both chambers head home for Christmas. House and Senate Democrats are unwilling to give the president any more than $1.6 billion for the border wall, a disagreement that has raised fears of a possible partial government shutdown. Trump scheduled a meeting Tuesday with Schumer and Pelosi to work out a solution that would both fund the government and his border wall."
6703,"Trump, top Democrats clash on border wall in rare Oval Office fight'",Reuters,12/11/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-congress/trump-top-democrats-clash-on-border-wall-in-rare-oval-office-fight-idUSKBN1OA1CF,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump openly fought with the top two Democratic lawmakers in the Oval Office on Tuesday about government funding, throwing into question whether a deal to avert a government shutdown was possible ahead of a deadline next week.
In a remarkable public argument, the likes of which is seldom seen before cameras, Trump brawled with U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi about paying for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border that they see as ineffective and wasteful.
“If we don’t get what we want, one way or the other - whether it’s through you, through a military, through anything you want to call - I will shut down the government,” Trump said as the heated argument drew to a crescendo.
“I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don’t want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country,” he said before reporters left their ringside seats.
Vice President Mike Pence sat beside Trump, silent and stone faced.
While Trump’s fellow Republicans control both the House and the Senate until next month, Democratic support is needed to pass any spending legislation.
If the impasse cannot be resolved by Dec. 21, about one-quarter of the federal government immediately would be left without funding. Money for the rest of the government already has been appropriated.
Trump has asked Congress for $5 billion for border security, while Schumer and Pelosi have offered to extend funding at current levels, around $1.3 billion. That is less than the $1.6 billion a bipartisan Senate committee approved.
While the battle over border security is contentious, the money being negotiated is a small portion of a $450 billion bill to keep agencies operating through next September.
In an interview with Reuters later in the day, Trump did not rule out a compromise on the funding. “We have to see what else is entailed,” he said.
HARSH WORDS CONTINUED
The meeting did not last long after reporters were ushered out of the Oval Office.
But the harsh words continued during a closed meeting of House Democrats. According to an aide in the room, Pelosi said Trump’s fixation with building a wall was “like a manhood thing for him. As if manhood could ever be associated with him.”
Pelosi told reporters she had asked Trump to pray about resolving the dispute, recounting the biblical story of King Solomon asking God for wisdom.
Pelosi told reporters that later in the day that she and Trump spoke by telephone, and the president said he was reviewing the offer made by Democrats during the White House meeting.
Despite the rancor, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, told reporters, “I’d still like to see a smooth ending here and I haven’t given up hope that’s what we’ll have.”

If there is no deal, Trump would be shuttering the very agency in charge of border security - the Department of Homeland Security. In past shutdown battles, workers deemed “essential” were instructed to work.
Other federal agencies that also would face closures include the departments of State, Commerce and Agriculture, and visitors would not be allowed into federal parks.
At the Pentagon, Lieutenant Colonel Jamie Davis said there were no plans now for the U.S. military to build sections of the border wall, though the Defense Department could under current law pay for some border barrier projects “such as in support of counter-drug operations or national emergencies.”
‘IT’S CALLED TRANSPARENCY’
The rocky White House meeting was the first Trump held with Pelosi and Schumer since Democrats won control of the House in Nov. 6 elections, possibly foreshadowing battles to come next year.
Trump told Reuters he thought it would be possible to work on legislation with Democrats - unless they launch a barrage of investigations into his administration and policies.
“We’re either going to start the campaign and they’re going to do presidential harassment. Or we’re going to get tremendous amounts of legislation passed working together,” he said.
Tuesday’s fight kicked off when Pelosi told Trump that Americans did not want to see a “Trump shutdown,” touching a nerve. Trump cut off Pelosi, arguing that he could not advance a funding bill without Democratic votes in the Senate.
“If I needed the votes for the wall in the House, I would have them in one session. It would be done,” Trump bragged.

“Well then - go do it, go do it,” Pelosi shot back.
Senior White House staff watched the melee from the edges of the room.
“I don’t think we should have a debate in front of the press on this,” Pelosi said, adding, “Let’s call a halt to this.”
“It’s not bad, Nancy - it’s called transparency,” Trump said."

“People do not yet realize how much of the Wall, including really effective renovation, has already been built. If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall. They know how important it is!” Trump vowed, capping a series of tweets meant to set the stage for the White House summit.
For their part, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer put out a joint statement Monday arguing Trump and his party will own a government shutdown if they can’t strike a deal.
""Republicans still control the House, the Senate and the White House, and they have the power to keep government open,"" they said. ""Our country cannot afford a Trump Shutdown,"" the Democrats said, adding that Trump ""knows full well that his wall proposal does not have the votes to pass the House and Senate and should not be an obstacle to a bipartisan agreement.""
Congress last week temporarily averted a partial shutdown amid the funeral services for the late President George H.W. Bush, pushing the new deadline to Dec. 21. Trump was meeting at the White House Tuesday with Pelosi and Schumer to discuss a new government spending package – with border wall funding the biggest sticking point. The Democratic leaders arrived at the White House shortly before noon.
Trump wants $5 billion for the project, while Democrats are offering $1.3 billion for border security.
The president earlier this year pushed for military funding to finance the border project. But while administrations can move some money around in their budgets, they need approval from Congress – and the relevant appropriations bills for fiscal 2019 did not include money for this purpose.
Top Democrats also warned earlier this year that the Pentagon would not have the power to redirect funding to the border wall.
But Trump’s tweets marked the latest effort on both sides to project a strong negotiating position.
The president also claimed that the wall and fencing already in place helped turn back the migrant caravans forming in Mexico. He accused Democrats of sacrificing border security for political reasons, even suggesting Pelosi is holding up funding for a border wall in order to secure votes for the speakership in the next Congress.
“We have already built large new sections & fully renovated others, making them like new. The Democrats … however, for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left, do NOT want Border Security. They want Open Borders for anyone to come in. This brings large scale crime and disease,” he tweeted.
“Our Southern Border is now Secure and will remain that way … I look forward to my meeting with Chuck Schumer & Nancy Pelosi. In 2006, Democrats voted for a Wall, and they were right to do so. Today, they no longer want Border Security. They will fight it at all cost, and Nancy must get votes for Speaker. But the Wall will get built.”
Pelosi does face pressure from her base not to bend on the border wall funding fight. But more than the speaker’s gavel is at stake – Democratic votes in both the House and Senate could be critical for averting a partial shutdown.
Sixty votes are required in the Senate to overcome a filibuster. And, at least for the near-term, Republicans only have 51 members.
Republicans for the rest of the month have a comfortable majority in the House, but lack the votes on their side alone to pass a bill with or without wall money.
Pelosi and Schumer have urged Trump to support a bill that includes a half-dozen government funding bills largely agreed upon by lawmakers, along with a separate measure that funds the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Sept. 30.
Democrats will likely push for a continuing resolution that funds the remaining appropriations bills if Trump doesn't agree to that, an aide told The Associated Press.
Trump said Friday that Congress should provide all the money he wants for the wall and called illegal immigration a ""threat to the well-being of every American community.""
Pelosi said she and many other Democrats consider the wall ""immoral, ineffective and expensive.""
Schumer said Democrats want to work with Trump to avert a shutdown, but said money for border security should not include the concrete wall Trump has envisioned. Instead, the money should be used for fencing and technology that experts say is appropriate, Schumer said.
""We do not want to let a Trump temper tantrum govern our policies or cause the shutdown of a government, which everyone on both sides of the aisle knows is the wrong idea,"" Schumer said. If Trump ""wants to shut down the government over Christmas over the wall, that's his decision,"" he said.
But House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., said Democrats were the ones playing politics.
Trump ""wants to secure the border. He got elected president on that platform,"" Scalise told Fox News.
If there's a better way to secure the border than the $5 billion plan Trump has laid out, Democrats ""need to come with an alternative,"" Scalise said Monday.

President Donald Trump clashed sharply with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer in a remarkable Oval Office meeting before reporters Tuesday, with the president threatening to shut down the government and the Democrats warning him they will not bend.
In a pitched partisan argument televised for all to see, the GOP president and the House and Senate Democratic leaders traded barbs over Trump’s border wall during what was supposed to be a private negotiating session to keep a large swath of the government from shuttering after Dec. 21.

And in perhaps his most definitive statement yet, Trump said he would be “proud” to preside over a partial shutdown if that’s what it takes to get his campaign promise fulfilled.
Democrats urged the president against such a stance, even as they seized on the chance to blame Trump for any potential shutdown.
“We shouldn’t shut down the government over a dispute,” said Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader.

“The last time, Chuck, you shut it down,” shot back Trump, referring to Democrats’ brief shut down over immigration earlier this year. “If we don’t get what we want … I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck.”
The public battle revealed the yawning gap between the president and congressional Democrats, foreshadowing the next 10 days of dramatic back-and-forth over whether roughly a quarter of the government will lapse due to the president’s $5 billion border wall request. It seems both parties have little incentive to give in: the Democratic grassroots doesn’t want a compromise with Trump, and the president sees no reason to give up now that the midterms are over.
Republicans are already grappling with the fallout. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said bluntly: ""I hope that's not where we end up.""
""I understand it was a rather spirited meeting. But I feel like I see a smooth ending here. I haven't given up hope,"" McConnell said after a GOP lunch with Vice President Mike Pence.
After the meeting, Schumer said that Trump had a ""temper tantrum"" and Pelosi said when Democrats take over in January, they will pass a bill that keeps border security funded at current levels.
“The President showed what he really thinks, he wants to shut down the government,” Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. “It’ll be a Trump shutdown and then Jan. 3, if it happens, the House will open it up again.”
Later, Schumer also backed away from a bipartisan Senate bill providing $1.6 billion in border fencing. Instead he's endorsing only the amount of funding that the president got last year: $1.3 billion.
Inside the White House meeting, the Democrats appeared united in their vow not to accede to Trump’s demands, but the president seemed to revel in battling both of them for the cameras.
Trump repeatedly said that the outgoing House GOP majority will give him his border wall funding and that the problem is Schumer’s Senate, bragging that Republicans held the upper chamber even as Schumer ridiculed him for touting wins in deep red states.
Then Trump turned his fire on Pelosi, questioning her negotiating position as she battles for the speakership. Liberals say the two Democratic leaders should deny Trump anything for his wall, and Pelosi is taking on a fight while she's still trying to accrue secure 218 votes to be elected speaker.
“If we don’t have border security, we’ll shut down the government,” Trump said, taunting Pelosi. “Nancy’s in a situation where it’s not easy to talk right now”
The California Democrat responded icily: “Please don’t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting.”
As Vice President Mike Pence watched on, Democrats said that the public firefight was unproductive.
“Let’s debate in private,” Schumer offered.
“Let us have a conversation where we don’t have to contradict in public,” Pelosi pleaded.
But Trump seemed to play up his persistence for the press.
“I will take the mantle,” Trump said of blame for a shut down. ""I will be the one to shut it down.”
Pelosi told her caucus earlier Tuesday that she and Schumer are pitching two funding options to Trump — neither of which would deliver a funding boost for the border wall, according to multiple people in Democratic Caucus meeting.
Both of their options would punt the border wall fight until fall 2019, long after House Democrats retake the majority, Pelosi told her caucus just ahead of the White House meeting.

Democrats planned to pitch Trump on a yearlong stopgap bill for the Department of Homeland Security, which would reup a current budget of $1.3 billion for border fencing, while approving the other six unfinished bills. That idea has already been rejected by GOP leaders on Capitol Hill.
They also intended to present a new backup option: Approve a massive yearlong stopgap bill, and punt all funding fights until fall 2019 to maximize Democratic leaders’ leverage in the House. But GOP leaders said they didn’t think Trump would sign something that barely speaks to his border wall request.
“I don’t expect the president would go along with that [if] he’s not getting the border funding he wants,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas).
Other Republicans said Trump’s remarks made their job harder but many blamed Democrats for being intractable.
“I don’t think it’s something to be proud of, I think it’s something to be resolved, “Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). “It’s absurd to deny this president additional wall money.”
Ahead of the meeting, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Pelosi and Schumer to cut a deal with Trump on funding the border wall, raising the prospects of another government shutdown this year over immigration. Senate Democrats refused to fund the government for a couple days in January in an effort to force a debate on immigration reform.
McConnell said he would watch “eagerly” to see if Democrats could accept a $5 billion infusion of money for border security.
“There is no reason for my Democratic friends to end this year the way they began it. It would be truly bizarre for them to decide they’d prefer a partial government shutdown to reasonable funding for national security. It would signal that their party is more committed to political spite for the president than to the public interest,” McConnell said.
While Congress has provided funding for border security, the massive spending bill Trump signed this spring was mostly restricted to fencing and border protection as a whole rather than a Trump-style wall or even the construction of wall prototypes.
He appeared to mix up the two again Tuesday when he claimed that Democrats voted in 2006 for a “wall,” which seems to refer to 2006 legislation to construct fencing along the southern border, even though it garnered little Democratic support in the House.
“If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall,” Trump wrote. “They know how important it is!”

2180,Trump sanctuary cities policies hit with another setback',New York Post,11/30/2018,,,https://nypost.com/2018/11/30/trump-sanctuary-cities-policies-hit-with-another-setback/,"A federal judge in Manhattan landed another blow to the Trump administration’s immigration policies Friday, blocking efforts to punish cities for protecting immigrants from the feds by blocking grants to local law enforcement.
The decision handed down by Judge Edgardo Ramos said the effort was unconstitutional because it violated the 10th Amendment and its separation-of-powers requirements.
The judge also determined the policy was “arbitrary and capricious.”
“As we argued, local law enforcement has the right to decide how to meet their local public safety needs — and the Trump administration simply does not have the right to require state and local police to act as federal immigration agents,” New York state Attorney General Barbara Underwood said in a statement. “The Trump administration’s attempt to withhold these vital funds was nothing more than a political attack at the expense of our public safety.”
New York was supposed to receive nearly $9 million from the grant program in 2017.
But the money was withheld after local officials refused to cooperate with new federal immigration policing requirements. Nearly half of that money would have flowed to New York City.
Underwood and five other AGs filed suit in July, challenging the policy.
It’s the latest in a series of federal rulings against President Trump’s controversial immigration policies.
A federal appeals court in California ruled earlier this month that Trump must continue a program that protects children brought to the US by their parents, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.
A separate federal court in San Francisco last week also blocked Trump’s efforts to deny asylum to immigrants crossing the southern border illegally."
2316,Federal judge in New York rules against Trump in sanctuary cities case',The Hill,11/30/2018,,,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/419146-judge-sides-with-sanctuary-cities-over-trump,"A federal judge on Friday ruled against the Trump administration's move to withhold grant funding from law enforcement agencies of so-called sanctuary cities, saying it was illegal and unconstitutional.
Judge Edgardo Ramos, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, said the government “did not have lawful authority” to make states alert federal agents when an undocumented immigrant is going to be released from state or local custody and allow federal agents to question immigrants in custody about their legal status in order for states and cities to receive funding.

In his ruling, Ramos blocked the government from enforcing those conditions on New York, New York City and the six states that also challenged the requirements: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington.
New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood (D) called the court’s decision a major win.
“As we argued, local law enforcement has the right to decide how to meet their local public safety needs — and the Trump administration simply does not have the right to require state and local police to act as federal immigration agents,” she said. “The Trump administration’s attempt to withhold these vital funds was nothing more than a political attack at the expense of our public safety.”
The challengers in Friday's case had asked Ramos to issue a nationwide injunction, but he said they had not shown that such a move was necessary to afford them relief. He also noted the scope of other district court decisions have been limited.
A judge for the Northern District of Illinois issued an injunction blocking the administration from enforcing the conditions nationwide in September 2017. The ruling was affirmed by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, but the court later put its nationwide scope on hold pending a review by the court’s full panel of judges.
In November 2017, a district court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania blocked the administration from enforcing the conditions on Philadelphia. The federal government has appealed that ruling to the 3rd Circuit. And a district court in California last month blocked the condition from being enforced on the city and county of San Francisco.

Yet another federal judge has found that the Trump administration’s attempts to strong-arm state and local governments into being as hostile to immigrants as possible is illegal.

U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District of New York ruled on Friday that that the executive order signed by President Donald Trump last January, which withheld funding from sanctuary cities, was both illegal and unconstitutional. Ramos agreed with the states that the order was a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be. . . in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” per Ramos’ ruling.
The ruling falls in line with a number of recent court decisions shooting down Republican actions against asylum-seekers and sanctuary cities, as does Ramos’ decision to single out Section 1373 of the U.S. immigration code—like a California judge ruled in October, Ramos found that section, which requires of information-sharing between the federal government and sanctuary cities, was a violation of the Tenth Amendment.

What sets Ramos’ decision apart from the previous sanctuary city cases in California is that his will affect a wide swath of states up and down the East Coast—per the Providence Journal, cities in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Washington D.C., and Virginia will all now be legally allowed to function as havens for asylum-seekers, so long as their own state governments allow them to.
As has been pointed out before, while some cities under Democratic control have fought to maintain this legal status, their actual commitment to protecting undocumented immigrants and asylum-seekers has fallen flat time and again, with police departments ( including those in New York City) routinely working with ICE and federal agencies to detain and deport community members.
As far as Trump’s larger war on migrants and refugee s goes , however, this is undoubtedly good news."

The president's tweet came the morning after Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents clashed with a group of migrants who rushed the southern border.
CBP on Sunday shut down the busy San Ysidro port of entry near San Diego as the migrants approached. Tensions flared further when dozens of migrants broke away from a larger group to try and cross the border.
CBP said in a statement that officers fired tear gas into the crowd after attempted illegal crossings and after some migrants threw rocks at border agents.
Photos quickly circulated on Twitter of women and children fleeing the tear gas, providing a stark contrast to Trump's repeated claims that the group of migrants is filled with ""criminals"" and ""thugs.""

Hundreds of migrants have been camped out in Tijuana, Mexico, as they wait to enter the U.S. Many are fleeing violence and poverty in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Trump has said those migrants will remain in Mexico while their asylum claims are processed by the U.S.
The president has for weeks painted the caravan of Central American migrants as an imminent security threat. He has vowed to close down the border, deployed thousands of troops to the border in anticipation of the groups arrival and signed a proclamation blocking certain immigrants from claiming asylum.
A federal judge last week blocked the proclamation.
UPDATE 4:13 p.m.: Trump later spoke with reporters on the White House lawn about the incident as he set out for a campaign rally in Mississippi.
The president against suggested the border could be closed as he insisted members of the immigrant caravan would not be let into the United States.
""We've during certain times, as you know, closed the border. They're not coming into the United States. They will not be coming into our country,"" Trump said.
Asked if he was comfortable with the use of tear gas at the border, Trump said authorities at the border were forced to do so.
""They had to use because they were being rushed by some very tough people and they used tear gas. And here's the bottom line: nobody's coming into our country unless they come in legally,"" he said."
4976,Trump seizes on border unrest ahead of perilous month',CNN (Web News),11/26/2018,,,https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/26/politics/donald-trump-robert-mueller-democrats-congress-g20-december/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump is seizing on an attempt by 500 migrants to rush the southern border to use immigration as an issue to bolster his presidency at a critical political moment.
Trump spent weeks ahead of the midterm elections warning that the United States was about to experience an invasion from a migrant caravan trekking north across Mexico, and sent troops to the border in what critics branded a political stunt.
He seized on unrest at the frontier on Sunday to hike pressure on Mexico and to squeeze his political opponents in Washington as he demands financing for his border wall in a looming government funding showdown.
""Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries,"" Trump tweeted early Monday morning.
""Do it by plane, do it by bus, do it anyway you want, but they are NOT coming into the U.S.A. We will close the Border permanently if need be. Congress, fund the WALL!""
Trump was reacting to reports that a group of migrants overwhelmed both Mexican federal and local police blockades and rushed towards the border at one of the busiest crossings between Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego. US authorities said several Border Patrol agents were hit by rocks, prompting the use of tear gas. Border crossings were closed in both directions for several hours, and it did not appear that any migrants breached the frontier.
The situation appeared to fall well short of the mass invasion by a caravan of thousands of migrants conjured up by Trump before the midterms.
Sunday's events will further electrify political tensions in Washington as it gets to work after the Thanksgiving holiday and ahead of a month of transition and increasing vulnerability for the President.
Trump is also set to travel to another big international summit this week -- the G20 in Argentina -- that carries the habitual possibility that he could again fall out with other world leaders. The trip will also bring him face-to-face with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the most contentious moment in US-China relations for decades as a trade war rages between the two powers.

Democrats lining up investigations
Most ominously for Trump, Democrats are positioning themselves to unleash an unprecedented regime of investigation and oversight against his White House as soon as they take the reins of power in January, while special counsel Robert Mueller grinds away ever closer to the President's inner circle
Just how miserable things could get next year for the President was revealed by incoming House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. The California Democrat vowed to bring acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker before Congress to probe whether he was appointed with the express purpose of disrupting the Mueller investigation.
He said the President was not being honest in casting doubt on the CIA's conclusion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
Schiff also said the new Democratic House would investigate whether the President's response to this and other foreign policy questions was being influenced by a ""hidden hand"" of investments or past or business ties.
""Is his personal financial interest driving US policy in the Gulf? Is it driving US policy vis-a-vis the Russians? We don't know, but it would be irresponsible not to find out,"" Schiff said.
On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who will head the House Oversight Committee, vowed proportionate investigations.
""The American people said to us through this election, 'We want accountability. We want to check on this President of the United States.' But they also said something else. They said, 'We want you to solve our problems,'"" Cummings said.
A glimpse of how Washington will change
The prospects of flying subpoenas and administration officials being hauled up to Capitol Hill points to crucial dynamics ahead of the 2020 elections.
How will the President react? Will Democrats overreach and play into McConnell's warnings of ""presidential harassment?"" Can the President leverage Democratic opposition to court suburban voters who deserted him in the midterms? Or will any revelations either from congressional probes or Mueller prove to be so serious that they bury his White House in scandal and put his entire presidency at risk?
Trump could emerge from a period of retooling in his administration facing even fewer restraints from subordinates than has already been the case.
Key officials like Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and White House chief of staff John Kelly are waiting to see if they will be retained. And Trump denied a Wall Street Journal report that he's getting irked by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over recent stock market losses.
Mnuchin is not currently thought to be threatened, but the report, and the President's frequent tweeting about oil prices and the markets, does appear to hint at some nervousness over the future of the economy, which in its currently roaring state is the best argument for his 2020 re-election hopes.
In a glimpse into the feudal nature of life in Trump's orbit, his former political aide Corey Lewandowski writes in his new book that enemies of the President are ""embedded"" in the White House and government agencies and trying to thwart his agenda, according to The Washington Post.
Trump has often embraced moments of converging threats and challenges to stoke an atmosphere of chaos in Washington that bolsters his standing with his political base and puts his opponents off balance.
But he now faces a test of his political strategy since his method -- for instance, using inflammatory rhetoric about immigration -- appears to have hurt Republicans in House races, even if it boosted Senate contenders.
For now, there is no sign of an adjustment: Trump broke convention in his Thanksgiving calls with troops by injecting political rhetoric about immigration and trade and boasting about his success.
His recent behavior, including a feud with Chief Justice John Roberts, either betrays an inability to rein in his relish for confrontation or a strategic decision that the wrecking ball approach is the best way to ensure his re-election.
Back on the border
Trump spent part of the weekend highlighting the migrant caravan.
""If for any reason it becomes necessary, we will CLOSE our Southern Border. There is no way that the United States will, after decades of abuse, put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore!"" Trump tweeted Saturday.
He may return to the topic on Monday in a pair of rallies for Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who is facing a runoff amid controversy over her past racially-tinged comments and actions.
The Washington Post reported that the incoming administration in Mexico has agreed to allow asylum seekers to remain south of the US border while their applications were processed, in what would be seen by Trump as a victory.
The new government, however, denied in a statement to CNN that a deal had been done.
A migrant is pushed back as she attempts to reach the border wall.
The politics of immigration will bear watching in the weeks ahead since they are crucial to Trump, who tends to resort to extremes, and Democrats who do not wish to come across as soft on border issues.
One Republican, Sen. Joni Ernst, who faces a potentially tricky Iowa re-election race in 2020, hinted at the delicate nature of an issue that electrifies Trump's base but can alienate more moderate voters on ""State of the Union.""
She said she would prefer that Trump not follow through on his threat to close the US border, though pointed to the reports from Mexico to argue his rhetoric could be working.
""I certainly think the President sees results any time that he does bring up an issue, and he does lay down certain reasons why he's doing what he's doing,"" Ernst told CNN's Dana Bash.
Ernst also said she hoped that Trump would not honor threats to partially shutter the government if he does not get his border wall funded.
Trump said last week that if there was ever going to be a shutdown over the border wall, now would probably be the time to do it.
Congress averted a shutdown in September by passing a massive spending bill to fund a large portion of the government. The package did not, however, include money for Trump's wall. Instead, lawmakers passed a shorter-term spending bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, among other agencies, until December 7.
It's not clear either side really wants a shutdown. If precedent is any guide, it's also possible the funding crunch could be put off by short-term deals that run until the end of the year or beyond.
The calculations could also influence other priorities in the mix, including disaster funding requests for fire-ravaged California, and a drive by Democrats and some Republicans to shield Mueller.
Bipartisan anger over Trump's approach to Saudi Arabia could also complicate deal making, with both sides conscious of how actions now could play out in the new political reality next year."
5473,Trump tells Mexico to ship migrants home or see border permanently closed',Fox News (Online),11/26/2018,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-tells-mexico-to-ship-migrants-home-or-see-border-permanently-closed,"President Trump offered Mexico some advice on deporting migrants massed in Tijuana and threatening to storm the U.S., telling the neighboring nation in a tweet to send them “back to their countries” by plane or by bus – or face a permanent closure of the border.
Trump’s tweet followed a vow from Mexico to deport migrants who tried to illegally enter the U.S. The Trump administration has said asylum claims from members of a series of caravans originating in Central America must be processed outside the U.S., and that all those entering illegally will be denied. A federal judge has at least temporarily ruled against the policy, but the administration has taken steps to harden the border.
“Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries,” Trump tweeted early Monday morning. “Do it by plane, do it by bus, do it anyway you want, but they are NOT coming into the U.S.A. We will close the Border permanently if need be. Congress, fund the WALL!”
The missive came after a chaotic Sunday that saw hundreds of migrants from a caravan that originated in Central American pushing past Mexican riot police and rushing the border at the port of entry in San Ysidro, Calif., in a major test for both U.S. border authorities and Mexican officials.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it suspended northbound and southbound crossings for both pedestrians and vehicles at the San Ysidro port of entry at approximately 11:30 a.m. local time. It later tweeted that the pedestrian crossings had re-opened, a little more than four hours after the initial closure. The vehicle lanes re-opened at approximately 5 p.m. local time, five-and-a-half hours after they were closed.
CBP added that some demonstrators ""attempted to illegally enter the U.S. through both the northbound and southbound vehicle lanes at the port of entry itself. Those persons were stopped and turned back to Mexico.""
U.S. border agents shot several rounds of tear gas after some migrants attempted to penetrate various points along the border and threw what appeared to be rocks at U.S. authorities.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement that some migrants ""attempted to breach legacy fence infrastructure along the border and sought to harm CBP personnel by throwing projectiles at them.
""As I have continually stated, DHS will not tolerate this type of lawlessness and will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons,"" Nielsen said. ""We will also seek to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who destroys federal property, endangers our frontline operators, or violates our nation’s sovereignty.""
The Mexican Interior Ministry said Sunday it would immediately deport the migrants who tried to ""violently"" breach the border. The Mexican government described Sunday's events as ""acts of provocation"" that were ""far from helpful"" for the migrants' objectives.
The situation Sunday was not unprecedented. In 2013, during the Obama administration, Border Patrol agents used pepper spray to fend off a crowd of approximately 100 migrants who attempted to rush the San Ysidro port of entry. The migrants in that episode also reportedly threw rocks and bottles at U.S. authorities.
Within an hour on Sunday, the group from the caravan that rushed toward the border largely dispersed. Most of the migrants in the group were men.
The prospective deal between the U.S. and Mexico was seen as a way to dissuade thousands of Central American migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S., a process that can take years. The legal bar for claiming asylum is high and generally requires applicants to show a specific risk of persecution based on factors such as race, nationality, politics or religion.
Trump administration officials have characterized the vast majority of asylum claims as fraudulent or legally insufficient, and have taken steps to reduce the backlog of asylum claims that they say are often used by migrants to gain entry into the U.S. and disappear into the country as their claims are adjudicated."

Mexico's incoming foreign minister has said discussions on how to deal with migrants travelling to the United States are continuing despite reports a deal has been reached.
Marcelo Ebrard denied reaching an agreement which would see asylum seekers waiting in Mexico while their claims were processed in US courts.
Mr Ebrard's words seem to contradict US President Donald Trump's latest tweet.
He said migrants would not be allowed entry until their claims were approved.
""Migrants at the Southern Border will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court,"" Mr Trump wrote, adding: ""No 'releasing' into the US. All will stay in Mexico.""
The conflicting statements emerged after the Washington Post reported Mexican officials had agreed to let migrants trying to enter the US stay in Mexico while their asylum claims were heard.
According to the newspaper, the plan was called ""Remain in Mexico"".
But Mr Ebrard, who will become foreign minister in December after Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's administration takes power, said the US had yet to even send ""a specific proposal"" on how to deal with the issue.
He said conversations were still taking place with Washington.

Incoming Interior Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero also told news agency Reuters no agreement had been reached - although the Washington Post article initially quoted her as saying it was a ""short term solution"" to deal with the migrant caravan.
Thousands of migrants - including women and children - are currently at the US-Mexico border after travelling more than 4,000km (2,500 miles) from Central America.
They say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.
Many are now waiting in temporary shelters in the border city of Tijuana, leading the mayor declare a humanitarian crisis. There are fears as many as 9,000 may be stuck in the city for months.
Meanwhile, Mr Trump has deployed about 5,800 troops to the border and has previously described the migrants as an ""invasion""."

“There is no agreement of any sort between the incoming Mexican government and the U.S. government,” future Interior Minister Olga Sanchez told Reuters on Saturday, contradicting Trump and an earlier Washington Post report that said a deal ― albeit an informal one ― had been struck between the two governments.
The Post had quoted Sanchez as saying the administration of Mexico’s President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who will take office on Dec. 1, had “for now” agreed to the so-called “Remain in Mexico” plan.
Sanchez was quoted by the paper as saying that Mexico would allow asylum seekers to stay in the country as a “short-term solution.”
Following the publication of the Post’s report, however, Sanchez back-pedaled on those remarks. She told Reuters that Obrador’s administration was “in talks” with the U.S., but stressed officials who weren’t yet in office couldn’t formally make any agreements.
ASSOCIATED PRESS Seven-year-old Honduran migrant Genesis Belen Mejia Flores waves an American flag at two U.S. border control helicopters flying overhead near a shelter in Tijuana, Mexico.
Reuters reported that Sanchez “did not explicitly rule out” that Mexico could allow Central American caravan migrants ― thousands of whom have arrived in Tijuana, just south of California ― to wait in the country while their claims are processed in the U.S.
Sanchez did, however, say that plans for Mexico to assume “safe third country” status had been “ruled out.” Under a “safe third” agreement, the U.S. could force migrants to seek asylum in Mexico.
Trump said in a pair of Saturday evening tweets that migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border “will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court.”
“No ‘Releasing’ into the U.S. … All will stay in Mexico,” the president wrote.
His tweets were interpreted as possible confirmation of the posible deal between the U.S. and Obrador’s administration.
Migrants at the Southern Border will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court. We only will allow those who come into our Country legally.

U.S. border agents shot several rounds of tear gas after some migrants attempted to penetrate various points along the border and threw what appeared to be rocks at U.S. authorities.
Mexico's Milenio TV showed images of migrants climbing over fences and peeling back metal sheeting to enter. Tear gas fumes were carried by the wind toward people who were hundreds of feet away, including some children.
Honduran Ana Zuniga, 23, also said she saw migrants opening a small hole in concertina wire at a gap on the Mexican side of a levee, at which point U.S. agents fired tear gas at them.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement that some migrants ""attempted to breach legacy fence infrastructure along the border and sought to harm CBP personnel by throwing projectiles at them.

The Mexican Interior Ministry said Sunday afternoon it would immediately deport the migrants who tried to ""violently"" breach the border. The Mexican government described Sunday's events as ""acts of provocation"" that were ""far from helpful"" for the migrants' objectives.
Earlier this month, President Trump said that troops stationed at the border would treat thrown rocks like ""firearms.""
""We're not going to put up with that,"" the president said. ""They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. I told them to consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks, like they did at the Mexico military and police, I said, consider it a rifle.""

Within an hour on Sunday, the group from the caravan that rushed toward the border largely dispersed. Most of the migrants in the group were men.
Fox News had confirmed early Sunday through an organizer for Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the group helping organize the leading Central American migrant caravan, that members of the caravan were planning to attempt to cross the port of entry at San Ysidro later in the day.
Footage posted by ITV correspondent Emma Murphy also showed several U.S. Border Patrol helicopters reportedly flying low overhead on the Mexican side of the border.
In anticipation of the planned migrant effort, U.S. authorities said they had deployed additional personnel to the San Ysidro port of entry on Sunday, including Air and Marine agents.
Other video showed migrants pushing toward a border fence chanting, ""Yes we can.""
The dramatic escalation at the border came as Mexico's incoming government denied reports Saturday that it had struck a deal with the White House to keep asylum-seekers in the country while their claims move through U.S. immigration courts. President Trump, for his part, again threatened to close the entire southern border if no deal could be reached between the two counties.
On Saturday, the first episode of caravan-related violence directed at U.S. authorities was reported by U.S. Border Patrol in Arizona, as a 31-year-old Honduran man who apparently split off from the caravan threw rocks at agents and a helicopter after setting a tree on fire.

Hours earlier, The Washington Post quoted her as saying that the incoming administration of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had agreed to allow migrants to stay in Mexico as a ""short-term solution"" while the U.S. considered their applications for asylum. Lopez Obrador will take office on Dec. 1.

TRUMP ADMIN SHARPLY LIMITS ASYLUM CLAIMS, CITING WIDESPREAD FRAUD, FEDERAL LAW
Early Sunday, Trump wrote on Twitter that it would be ""very SMART"" for Mexico to ""stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border"" to avoid future logistics challenges at the border.
There were signs last week that the Mexican government has received that message. Mexican immigration agents on Wednesday detained almost all of the Central American migrants on a fourth caravan that recently entered Mexico seeking to reach the U.S., with Mexico's National Immigration Institute saying 213 migrants were detained and taken to a processing center. Those found to lack proper documents may face repatriation to their home countries.
Other administration officials sounded notes of optimism despite the apparent confusion on how to handle the migrants.
WATCH: SAN DIEGO BORDER PATROL DIRECTOR SAYS HE'S 'PREPARING FOR THE WORST'
""President Trump has developed a strong relationship with the incoming [Lopez] Obrador administration, and we look forward to working with them on a wide range of issues,"" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said over the weekend.
Approximately 5,000 Central American migrants have arrived in recent days to Tijuana, just south of California, after making their way through Mexico via caravan. But agents at the San Diego port of entry process fewer than 100 claims per day.
On Friday, the mayor of Tijuana declared a humanitarian crisis in his border city of 1.6 million people, saying he was asking the United Nations for aid to deal with the approximately 5,000 Central American migrants, most of whom were camped out inside a sports complex.
The comments by Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum came as city officials and volunteers worked together to assist the 4,976 men, women and children who had arrived after more than a month on the road.
Hundreds of Tijuana residents have protested their arrival, complaining that recent caravans forced their way into Mexico from Guatemala.
Trump threatened Thursday, and again on Saturday, to shut down the border crossing entirely if his administration determines that Mexico has lost ""control"" of the situation in Tijuana.
Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin, described the Remain in Mexico plan as a strategy to take away the ability of migrants to live and work in the U.S. while cases are processed.
""The hope is that asylum seekers will not want to live in [Mexico] for months/years and won't come,"" Leutert wrote on Twitter.
She added: ""The big question is why would Mexico agree to this? ... Mexico has its own migratory enforcement interests and the various caravans have been a huge headache.""
U.S. officials have said for months that they were working with Mexico on possible proposals. One variation, called ""Safe Third,"" would have denied asylum claims on the grounds that asylum seekers had found haven in Mexico. President Enrique Pena Nieto offered thousands of Central Americans asylum on Oct. 26 if they agreed to remain in southern Mexico. Close to 3,000 migrants took Mexico up on the offer.
Sanchez said Saturday that the next government does not plan for Mexico to become a ""Safe Third"" country.
Julieta Vences, a congresswoman with Lopez Obrador's Morena party who is also president of Mexico's congressional migrant affairs commission, told the AP that incoming Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard has been discussing with U.S. officials how to handle a deluge of asylum claims at the border.
""They're going to have to open the borders (for the migrants) to put in the request,"" Vences said. ""They will also give us dates, on what terms they will receive the (asylum) requests and in the case that they are not beneficiaries of this status, they will have to return here,"" Vences said.
She said Mexico needs to examine how to accommodate the migrants without angering locals.
""When they come back, we need to see how ... we can integrate them into an economic activity so that they can develop and not generate conflict with our own communities.""

2949,"Tensions rise at U.S.-Mexico border as migrants, holiday travelers wait to cross'",Reuters,11/23/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-caravan/tensions-rise-at-u-s-mexico-border-as-migrants-holiday-travelers-wait-to-cross-idUSKCN1NS01A,"TIJUANA (Reuters) - Hundreds of Central American migrants in Mexico massed on Thursday around a tense U.S. border crossing, where security measures held up long lines of Mexicans headed to Thanksgiving gatherings on the other side of the frontier.
With few belongings, and many of them with children in tow, the migrants set out for the crossing from the baseball field in the Mexican border city of Tijuana where they have been camped out. Around 6,000 migrants who have trekked across Mexico in a caravan in recent weeks are now crammed into the field.
They arrived at the Chaparral border crossing, opposite San Diego, California, and said they would wait there until they could request asylum, in spite of growing U.S. measures to tighten the border.
“We are already desperate, last night it rained and we all got wet. There is no room left. We are all sick. My children have a cold ... and nobody has come to give us help,” said David, a Honduran who only provided his first name.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he had authorized the use of lethal force on the border and warned that the United States could close the whole frontier.
The San Ysidro vehicular crossing into San Diego, one of the busiest in the world, was briefly shuttered in the afternoon by U.S. officials as they performed a security exercise.
Tens of thousands of Mexicans enter the United States daily to work or study, and many were trying to get to Thanksgiving celebrations. Mariana del Campo, a retired professor, had hoped to make it across before the closing, but was stuck in the line.
“What’s happening on the border is maddening,” she said as she waited in her car. “I don’t know how long we can put up with this. Someone is going to get tired or explode.”
Also stuck in her car waiting to cross for Thanksgiving was 54-year-old Aurora Diaz, who said her U.S.-based daughter was reluctant to visit Mexico in case Trump closed the border.

Tensions were palpable at the pedestrian crossing where the Central Americans had gathered. Mexican police and soldiers stood guard while a helicopter buzzed over the U.S side.
Edgar Corzo, an official from Mexico’s human rights commission, spoke into a megaphone to the crowd, telling them they could request assistance in Mexico.
But migrants arrived with blankets and prepared to bed down for the night outside the border station. Some of the children cried and complained of the cold.

Authorities in Tijuana said the migrants are facing up to a six-month wait to be able to get an appointment to plead their case for asylum with U.S. authorities.
Earlier this week, U.S. officials briefly closed the main border crossing in Tijuana, putting up concrete barricades and razor wire after reports that migrants could try to rush the crossing.
“I want President Trump to know that we’re peaceful people, we don’t have weapons, we haven’t come to do evil,” said a man who declined to give his name, holding a white flag on a wooden stick that read “Peace, God is with us.” “We want to work, we want them to help us for the love of God,” he added."
2343,Why and how are asylum seekers entering the U.S.?',Los Angeles Times,11/23/2018,,,https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-asylum-seekers-qa-20181122-story.html,"Many immigrants entering the U.S. — legally and illegally — claim asylum. Advocates for greater limits on immigration, particularly “chain migration” based on family relationships rather than employment skills, have tried to restrict asylum seekers.
This month, President Trump issued a proclamation preventing immigrants from claiming asylum if they crossed the border illegally. On Monday, a federal judge in San Francisco blocked that “asylum ban.”
But the judge’s ruling did not address another U.S. policy that’s forcing asylum seekers to wait on the Mexican side of border bridges, adding their names to growing waiting lists maintained by Mexican officials. On Thursday, a small group of Central American migrants marched peacefully to a border crossing in Tijuana to demand better conditions and push to enter the U.S. We talked to migrants waiting to cross the border legally at a shelter and border bridge in Matamoros, Mexico, and those who had crossed illegally and were released by U.S. immigration officials in neighboring Brownsville, Texas, last week — with notices to appear in immigration court — about why and how they were seeking asylum.
Why cross legally at a border bridge or illegally via the Rio Grande?

Most asylum seekers at the Matamoros bridge said they understood that by law, it was legal to enter the U.S. via the bridge. Some were aware of Trump’s edict and feared that if they crossed the Rio Grande illegally, they could hurt their chances of being granted asylum. But with the Mexican list having grown last week to 80 names, they also worried about how long they would have to wait to cross. Some had already waited more than a month. Many of the migrants had been granted temporary visas in Mexico that had expired or were due to expire by month’s end, and they worried they could be deported.
“I came here because I thought it would be faster,” said Cuban asylum seeker Ronald Padron, 37, who had waited 26 days at the Matamoros bridge.

Among migrants released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the bus station in Brownsville, most said they had crossed the Rio Grande illegally about 60 miles west near Reynosa, a Gulf cartel stronghold. They had been released after Trump’s announcement because it was still up to asylum officers and immigration judges to decide the validity of their asylum claims.

Many said they were unaware that there was a border bridge in Reynosa, or that it was possible to cross the bridge legally. Some who had seen the bridge said they were afraid to approach, because it was surrounded by Mexican drug cartel lookouts.
“They told me they would kidnap me if I went to the bridge … it’s very difficult to decide” how to cross the border, said Honduran migrant Wilmer Gamez, 37, who crossed the river near Reynosa.
Other migrants said they crossed the river — on foot or rafts — because it was the most direct or cheapest route. They said they paid smugglers $1,000 to $2,400.

Honduran migrant Jessica Morillo, 26, paid $2,400 to cross the river near Reynosa. She didn’t know about Trump’s action or that she could cross a nearby border bridge. She said she fled her home country because a drug trafficker had raped her, then threatened her with a gun. When she told her father she was pregnant in September, he threw her out, and she had been staying with a cousin. She hoped to join her sister in New Orleans.
Do most asylum seekers have relatives in the U.S.?
Almost all of the Central American asylum seekers at the bridge in Matamoros and at the bus station in Brownsville said they had relatives in the U.S. Most of the relatives, they said, were parents, siblings, uncles or cousins spread across the country, from Los Angeles to Miami, New York and Washington. Some at the bus station were seeking to join family working in rural areas of Nebraska and Mississippi. Most African migrants at the bridge said they did not have relatives in the U.S. and hoped to join friends instead. Tsenay Bogale, 48, of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, came with her aunt hoping to join friends in Washington.
What did asylum seekers do for work in their home countries?

Many of the Central American immigrants said they were farmers and store clerks. There was also a mechanic, nurse and teacher. All said they hoped to work in the U.S. None had advanced degrees. A few were elderly, joining younger relatives or friends.
In the U.S., political asylum is provided to those fleeing persecution — what are they fleeing?
Some of the asylum seekers were unfamiliar with U.S. law, which holds that asylum seekers must have a “credible fear” of being persecuted in their home countries based on their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a “particular social group.” In the past, that included victims of domestic and gang violence; this year, then-Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions issued a ruling saying such victims don’t qualify.
Norma Torres and her husband said they fled Nicaragua with their three children five weeks ago after they were threatened by soldiers for protesting and working with Catholic groups challenging the ruling government.

“No one can say anything” against the government, she said.
The couple knew it was illegal to cross between border bridges, had seen reports about Trump’s asylum ban and chose to wait at the Matamoros shelter instead of crossing the river. Mexican officials had yet to issue them a number on the waiting list last week.
“No one is helping us,” said Torres, 35.
Rene Hormaza, 28, who ran a cafeteria in Cuba, said he fled with his wife and two children after being threatened by police in August.

“If you don’t shut your mouth, they disappear you,” he said of Cuban authorities as he waited at the border bridge. “I have the hope that the U.S. will help us Cubans.”

Migrants from Guatemala in Matamoros and at the bus station said they fled a combination of economic and political hardships. Some from urban areas said they were unable to find work. Farmers said their coffee crops had suffered blight. At the same time, they said they had trouble moving or finding work because of political corruption and nepotism. It would be up to a U.S. asylum officer and immigration judge to decide if they qualified for asylum.
African migrants in Matamoros described being threatened and attacked for speaking out and protesting against oppressive governments.

Lynda Fotso, 24, a stock clerk from Cameroon, said she was detained for protesting against the government in 2015. An only child, she doesn’t have friends or family in neighboring countries. She first fled to Nigeria, but didn’t apply for asylum there because she knew the government had returned other migrants from Cameroon. She speaks French and some English but no Spanish, so once she landed in South America, she headed for the U.S., which she and other migrants from Cameroon called a bastion of human rights.
“I just want safety,” Fotso said in French as she sat waiting in the dark with other asylum seekers at the foot of the border bridge. “I can better adapt in the U.S.”
Farmer Collins Fondong, 33, also left Cameroon after being threatened by police for criticizing the government. He has lymphatic filariasis, a tropical disease, and ran out of medication after he arrived in Mexico in September. He was No. 29 on the list of asylum seekers waiting to cross at Matamoros last week.
“I pray it works,” he said of the list. “When you’re running away from death, you will do anything.”

He was eventually allowed to cross and volunteers said he received treatment at a local hospital.
Why didn’t they seek asylum in Mexico, or one of the countries they crossed en route to Mexico?
Advocates for greater limits on immigration have pushed for a “safe third country” agreement between the U.S. and Mexico, similar to the one the U.S. has with Canada, that would force migrants who arrive in Mexico to first seek asylum there. Immigrant advocates argue Mexico is too dangerous, its asylum processing too rudimentary, to be considered a safe refuge.
Asylum seekers in Matamoros, including Fotso, said they feared for their safety in Mexico and did not consider seeking asylum there. Central American and Cuban migrants said their goal was to join relatives in the U.S. African migrants said they didn’t speak Spanish and had a better chance of finding work and building new lives in the U.S. rather than in Mexico.

Migrants from Cameroon mostly fled through Nigeria, flying to Ecuador, then traveling by bus and on foot through the perilous jungles of Central America. They had read reports of fellow migrants being detained and deported in Nigeria, and so didn’t consider seeking asylum there.

Michael Randy, 30, a businessman from Cameroon, said he fled to the U.S. because it was the only country in the world he trusted to respect human rights. He had read reports about fellow members of Cameroon’s Anglophone minority who fled to Nigeria and were returned by the government to Cameroonian authorities.
“Massacres are happening in my country, genocide. Just the fact that you speak English in my country is a problem,” said Randy. “I have to be somewhere I feel safe.”

6018,"Small group breaks from caravan, within 500 feet of US border, report says'",Fox News (Online),11/23/2018,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/small-group-breaks-from-caravan-within-500-feet-of-us-border-report-says,"A group of about 150 migrants carrying white flags that read, ""La paz y Dios,"" or ""Peace and God are With Us,"" separated from the larger caravan near Southern California and inched within 500 feet of the U.S., a report Thursday said.
The migrants said they are carrying the white flags to show that they are peaceful, and will attempt to present themselves as asylum seekers near Baja, Calif., The San Diego Union-Tribune reported.
President Trump on Thursday threatened to close the border with Mexico if his administration determines that Mexico has lost control of the situation. The Union-Tribune reported that Mexican federal police held a barrier near a pedestrian crossing and urged the migrants to apply for jobs in Tijuana. Police claimed there are thousands of jobs in the city. Federal police were dressed in riot gear and prevented the caravan from getting closer to the U.S.
Carlos Lopez, a Honduran who was leading the small group, told the paper that the conditions in Mexico are horrible. He said there are sick children and women and children are forced to remain outside in the elements. Those already in the city have camped out in tents, slept on dirt fields or under bleachers or are staying in overcrowded shelters throughout the city as they wait to figure out their next steps.
""The whole world is watching what is happening here,"" he said.
The report said the larger group contains about 6,219 Central Americans. The federal government estimates the number of migrants could grow to 10,000 in the coming weeks, or months. President Trump warned that the caravan is a national security threat and it will not enter the U.S.
On Monday, a judge barred the president from enforcing a ban on asylum for those who cross the U.S. border illegally – a decision the administration said would cause “countless illegal aliens to pour into our country.""
The report said that the migrants who traveled for over a month can now see a bridge that separates them from the U.S.
Speaking to reporters while in Florida for the holiday, Trump threatened to close the U.S. border with Mexico for an undisclosed period of time if his administration determines that its southern ally has lost ""control"" on its side.
Trump also said he has given the thousands of active-duty troops he sent to the border before the Nov. 6 midterm elections the ""OK"" to use lethal force against migrants ""if they have to."" And he said Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, whom he has faulted for not being tough enough on immigration, is ""in there trying.""

2990,A Judge Just Ruled Asylum Claims Must Be Accepted Anywhere Along Border',Townhall,11/20/2018,,,https://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2018/11/20/judge-asylum-n2536253,"The White House announced earlier this month that migrants hoping to enter the U.S. could only claim asylum at certain points of entry, not just anywhere along the border. Critics accused President Trump of circumventing Congress and rights groups like the ACLU challenged the decision in court. The opponents have now won a short term victory.
Judge Jon S. Tigar of the United States District Court in San Francisco issued a temporary restraining order on Monday blocking the new rule.
""Whatever the scope of the president’s authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,” Tigar wrote.
Brandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol Council, responded on Fox News Tuesday, saying that the judge “just encouraged migrants to break the law.”
The White House is expected to appeal the decision.
President Trump has sounded off on the migrant caravan heading toward the U.S.-Mexico border, calling it an ""invasion."" He sent about 5,000 troops to the border to prevent the caravan from entering the U.S.
DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has been active on Twitter sharing how her agency is dealing with the overwhelming amount of asylum seekers."
6122,Federal Judge Blocks Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Proclamation Targeting Some Asylum Seekers',New York Times (Online News),11/20/2018,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/us/judge-denies-trump-asylum-policy.html,"Administration officials signaled that they would continue to defend the policy as it moved through the courts.
“Our asylum system is broken, and it is being abused by tens of thousands of meritless claims every year,” Katie Waldman, spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, and Steve Stafford, the Justice Department spokesman, said in a statement.
They said the president has broad authority to stop the entry of migrants into the country. “It is absurd that a set of advocacy groups can be found to have standing to sue to stop the entire federal government from acting so that illegal aliens can receive a government benefit to which they are not entitled,” they said. “We look forward to continuing to defend the executive branch’s legitimate and well-reasoned exercise of its authority to address the crisis at our southern border.”
Presidents indeed have broad discretion on immigration matters. But the court’s ruling shows that such discretion has limits, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration scholar at Cornell Law School.
“The ruling is a significant blow to the administration’s efforts to unilaterally change asylum law. Ultimately this may have to go to the Supreme Court for a final ruling,” said Mr. Yale-Loehr.
The advocacy groups accused the government of “violating Congress’s clear command that manner of entry cannot constitute a categorical asylum bar” in their complaint. They also said the administration had violated federal guidelines by not allowing public comment on the rule.
But Trump administration officials defended the regulatory change, arguing that the president was responding to a surge in migrants seeking asylum based on frivolous claims, which ultimately lead their cases to be denied by an immigration judge. The migrants then ignore any orders to leave, and remain unlawfully in the country."
5369,"Federal judge blocks Trump's new asylum rules: 'He may not rewrite the immigration laws'""",USA TODAY,11/20/2018,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/19/federal-judge-blocks-trumps-new-asylum-rules-migrant-caravan/2060994002/,"A federal judge in San Francisco blocked new rules put into place by President Donald Trump that limit the ability of immigrants to request asylum, a legal blow to the administration’s efforts to curb legal immigration that opens the door for more members of the immigrant caravan to request asylum in the USA.
U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar ruled late Monday that the administration's new policy of cutting off asylum to immigrants who enter the country illegally appears to run afoul of U.S. law that specifically allows them to do so.
The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act states that any foreigner who arrives in the USA, ""whether or not at a designated port of arrival,"" may apply for asylum. On Nov. 9, Trump tried to overrule that law, signing a presidential proclamation ending the ability of immigrants to request asylum if they enter the country illegally.
“The rule barring asylum for immigrants who enter the country outside a port of entry irreconcilably conflicts with the INA and the expressed intent of Congress,"" wrote Tigar, who was appointed by President Barack Obama. ""Whatever the scope of the President’s authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden.”

Tigar issued a temporary restraining order, meaning the administration is forbidden from enforcing the new rules until the court case proceeds Dec. 19.
In a joint statement Tuesday, the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice said it was “absurd” that a collection of advocacy groups were able to sue the federal government to stop the asylum policy. The lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of four groups that help immigrants.
The statement did not announce an appeal, but it made clear that the administration will fight Tigar’s ruling in court.
""We look forward to continuing to defend the Executive Branch's legitimate and well-reasoned exercise of its authority to address the crisis at our southern border,"" wrote Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman and Justice spokesman Steven Stafford.
The White House later issued a statement saying the “decision will open the floodgates, inviting countless illegal aliens to pour into our country on the American taxpayer’s dime.”
“This temporary injunction is yet another example of activist judges imposing their open borders policy preferences, which are rejected by the overwhelming majority of the American people, and interfering with the executive branch’s authority to administer the immigration system in a manner that ensures the Nation’s safety, security, and the rule of law,” the statement said.
As that legal process moves along, the ruling could have an immediate impact on members of the immigrant caravan of mostly Central Americans who are gathering in Tijuana to try to enter the USA.
Asylum is a form of protection granted to people who fear persecution in their home countries based on their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or their political opinion. From 2000 to 2016, the United States granted asylum to an average of 26,651 foreigners a year, according to Department of Homeland Security data.
The number of asylum applications has skyrocketed in recent years, from 5,000 in 2008 to 97,000 in 2018, mostly fueled by Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries.
Trump signed his directive after a monthlong attack against the immigrant caravan. He took to the campaign trail to warn about a looming ""invasion"" from caravan members who were criminals, gang members and ""Middle Easterners.""
To justify the move, he relied on a law that allows a president to suspend entry of foreigners if he signs a proclamation declaring them ""detrimental to the interests of the United States."" That's the same rationale he used to implement his controversial travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries. The first two versions of the travel ban were shot down in court, but the third was upheld by the Supreme Court.
Department of Justice lawyers cited the travel ban decision in the asylum lawsuit.
""Consistent with this explanation, the proclamation imposes limited measures to ameliorate the crisis along the southern border,"" the lawyers wrote.
The ACLU argued that the president's powers over immigration are not absolute and do not allow him to unilaterally cut off asylum for entire groups of people.
“The Court’s ruling makes clear that the President cannot override Congress, and will save lives,"" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney who brought the suit.
In court filings, the ACLU argued that the asylum restrictions were a direct challenge to the clear intention of Congress when it passed the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. The group cited a 1951 United Nations treaty signed by the United States that says ""refugees should not be penalized for their illegal entry"" because extreme situations sometimes ""require refugees to breach immigration rules.""
The ACLU used the example of the immigrant caravan, which is massing by the thousands in Tijuana, Mexico. Many members have said they want to present themselves at ports of entry to make their asylum request, but the majority cannot do so because U.S. officials at the San Ysidro Port of Entry can process only about 100 requests a day.
That has left caravan members stranded in Tijuana, a ""life-threatening"" situation that leaves them vulnerable to criminals who seek to take advantage of them, the ACLU attorneys wrote.
""Asylum seekers turned back from a port of entry have been raped, beaten, and kidnapped and held for ransom by cartel members waiting outside,"" they wrote. ""Asylum seekers who need to reach safety as quickly as possible thus often feel compelled to enter the United States along the border, outside of a port of entry, in order to escape their persecutors and the violence on Mexico’s side of the border.""
A separate lawsuit filed in Washington challenges another move by the Trump administration to limit asylum claims. In that case, the ACLU and other groups say the administration overstepped its legal limits when it issued rules barring immigrants from qualifying for asylum based on domestic abuse or gang violence.
Lawyers argued that case Monday, and the judge could issue a ruling any day."
2535,Trump shocks with racist new ad days before midterms',CNN (Web News),11/2/2018,,,https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/31/politics/donald-trump-immigration-paul-ryan-midterms/index.html,"(CNN) In the most racially charged national political ad in 30 years, President Donald Trump and the Republican Party accuse Democrats of plotting to help people they depict as Central American invaders overrun the nation with cop killers.
The new web video, tweeted by the President five days before the midterm elections , is the most extreme step yet in the most inflammatory closing argument of any campaign in recent memory.
The Trump campaign ad is the latest example of the President's willingness to lie and fear-monger in order to tear at racial and societal divides; to embrace demagoguery to bolster his own political power and the cause of the Republican midterm campaign.
The web video -- produced for the Trump campaign -- features Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican man who had previously been deported but returned to the United States and was convicted in February in the slaying of two California deputies.
""I'm going to kill more cops soon,"" a grinning Bracamontes is shown saying in court as captions flash across the screen reading ""Democrats let him into our country. Democrats let him stay.""
The ad recalls the notorious ""Willie Horton"" campaign ad financed by supporters of the George H.W. Bush campaign in the 1988 presidential election. Horton was a convicted murderer who committed rape while furloughed under a program in Massachusetts where Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis was governor.
The ad has since come to be seen as one of the most racially problematic in modern political history since it played into white fear and African-American stereotypes. It was regarded at the time as devastating to the Dukakis campaign.
Trump's web video, while just as shocking as the Horton spot, carries added weight since, unlike its 1988 predecessor, it bears the official endorsement of the leader of the Republican Party -- Trump -- and is not an outside effort. Given that Trump distributed it from his Twitter account, It also comes with all the symbolic significance of the presidency itself.
In a first reaction, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said the ad was a sign of desperation and suggested that Trump was losing the argument over health care that is at the center of the Democratic campaign.
""This is distracting, divisive Donald at his worst,"" Perez said on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time.""
""This is fear mongering. ... They have to fear monger and his dog whistle of all dog whistles is immigration. This has been Donald Trump's playbook for so long.""
""Family unification to invasion""
The Trump ad also flashes to footage of the migrant caravan of Central American asylum seekers that is currently in Mexico, which Trump says is preparing an invasion of the United States, implying that everyone in the column of people fleeing repression, poverty and economic blight is bent on murder and serious crime on US soil.
""Who else would Democrats let in?"" a caption asks.
A source close to the White House told CNN's Jim Acosta that the web ad was produced by Jamestown Associates for the Trump campaign for the midterms and was designed to fit into Trump's broader immigration push and to change the argument from ""family unification to invasion.""
""It's clearly working. We are all talking about it and not health care,"" the source said.
Trump has repeatedly warned that the caravan is laden with criminals or also includes Middle Eastern terrorists. He has offered no evidence for such claims, however, and even admitted last week there is no proof to support them.
The President has also often used racially suggestive rhetoric in his tweets and launched his presidential campaign in 2015 with a tirade against Mexicans. But he accuses the media, which points out his frequent falsehoods and flaming rhetoric, of being to blame for national divides.
Controversy over the new ad is certain to explode across the final days of the election in which polls suggest Democrats could take back the House of Representatives but Republicans could keep or even expand their Senate majority.
The new campaign web video was the culmination of a day on which the President staked out ever more extreme positions.
He took advantage of his role as commander-in-chief to promise to triple the number of troops to 15,000 that he has pledged to send to the southern border to repel the caravan -- which is still hundreds of miles away.
He also made a dubious claim of presidential power to reinforce his vow to change the Constitution on his own to end birthright citizenship that is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.
A sign of weakness?
Trump's combustible strategy is coinciding with an energetic final campaign swing featuring 11 rallies that opened in Florida on Wednesday night.
His increasingly inflammatory tactics are allowing him to refocus next Tuesday's election on his chosen issues, after a week of serial bombings and shootings that drowned out his closing argument.
Still, Democrats are increasingly confident five days out that they will take back the House, which they lost in the 2010 midterms.
""Up until today, I would have said, 'if the election were held today, we would win,"" former and possibly future speaker Nancy Pelosi said on ""The Late Show"" on CBS Tuesday.
""What now I'm saying is, we will win.""
One way of looking at Trump's increasingly frantic approach is that it is a sign of political weakness, because it seems to be a bid to drive up turnout in red state Senate races but might imply that tight House elections, that could be affected by such rhetoric, are out of reach.
However, everyone wrote Trump off in 2016, and it's possible his combative approach could defy pollsters again.
In another extraordinary development on Wednesday, the sitting President lashed out at the House speaker of his own party five days before an election, in a possible preview of a post-voting blame game.
Paul Ryan had dismissed the President's birthright gambit, but Trump told him in a tweet to do more to save the House.
""This is a great way to screw up the message a week before the election,"" a senior GOP aide told CNN's Acosta.
""First the birthright comment itself and now attacking the top Republican in Congress who is trying to save our majority.""
The President insisted he would not blame Ryan if Democrats won the House, though sounded less confident about Republican prospects in that chamber than in the Senate.
""I know we're doing well in the Senate and it looks like we're doing OK in the House. We're going to have to see,"" Trump told reporters.
Critics have accused Trump of abusing his power by sending troops to the southern border as part of a campaign stunt on a mission that has yet to be defined and he has implied will feature combat troops, but will in fact be made up of support forces.
But Defense Secretary James Mattis said Wednesday ""we don't do stunts"" and said the troops were being sent to offer ""practical support"" at the request of the Department of Homeland Security.
However, Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier of California accused Trump of squandering taxpayer funds in a desperate bid to buy votes, and predicted the American people would see through the plan.
""We are sending 10 to 15,000 troops, which means we are going to spend between $100 (million) and $150 million so he can have, I guess his surprise, his October surprise,"" she said on CNN's ""The Situation Room.""
Trump will Thursday press on with his pre-election blitz in Missouri, where he is trying to take out Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in the first of two rallies in the state in the next few days. Before Tuesday he will also visit West Virginia, Indiana twice, Montana, Florida again, Georgia, Tennessee and Ohio.
But two senior GOP sources told CNN's Jeff Zeleny that the President had been asked to steer clear of Arizona and Nevada amid concern he could hurt rather than help Republicans locked in tight Senate races."

The ad, which Trump tweeted and pinned to the top of his Twitter account, shows clips of Bracamontes spewing profanities and threats while at trial, followed by the message, ""Democrats let him stay.""

Bracamontes first entered the country illegally in 1993, when he was 16. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office told the Bee that he was arrested in 1996 on marijuana possession related charges and deported on June 3, 1997.
Arizona records show he was arrested on drug charges again in Phoenix in 1998, then released “for reasons unknown” by then-Sheriff Joe Arpaio's office.
He was arrested again on similar charges in May of 2001 and deported.
The Bee was unable to ascertain his exact re-entry date, but records show Bracamontes getting married in Maricopa County on Feb. 28, 2002, meaning he re-entered the country under the Bush administration. He was not deported again before the murder of two police officers in 2014.
The ad, directed at building support for Republican midterm candidates, has received harsh criticism, even from some in Trump's own party.

5418,Democrats take the immigration bait',Washington Examiner,11/2/2018,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/democrats-take-the-immigration-bait,"In a clip that left-wing critics have compared to the infamous Willie Horton attack ad, President Trump blamed Democratic policies for allowing convicted cop killer Luis Bracamontes to illegally enter, re-enter, and stay in the country. The video draws broad and largely illogical comparisons between Bracamontes — who repeatedly entered the country illegally — and the vast migrant caravan from Honduras still thousands of miles away from the U.S.
On the facts, Trump is incorrect. Joe Arpaio, the Republican sheriff pardoned by Trump himself for criminal contempt of court, actually freed Bracamontes "" for reasons unknown"" after an arrest for drug charges in 1998 after he had illegally entered the U.S. multiple times. Technically, both Republican and Democratic failures led to Bracamontes' rampage, but rather than focusing on facts, Trump is betting on videos like these baiting Democrats into overstepping on immigration rhetoric in the final days before the midterms.
Democrats could easily counter Trump's false equivalencies and fearmongering with simple logic. Many cases like Bracamontes' stem from a failure of enforcement, not a lack of new laws.
Instead, however, they reach to embrace Trump's most extreme straw men, the ones meant to smear them.

When Trump issues overblown attacks toward a migrant caravan that border control will rightfully repel, the Left lurches instantly toward the ""racist"" label, implying that mere belief in American sovereignty and demand for an orderly, lawful immigration system is an expression of white supremacy. Certainly, a minority of Republicans impulsively fear immigration for racist or xenophobic reasons rather than economic or legal ones. But it will backfire if Democrats demonize everyone who wants to keep criminal immigrants out of the U.S.
Trump does himself no favors by attacking the bounds of legal immigration. But by ruthlessly and viscerally castigating violent illegal immigrants, Trump has baited the Left into calling border enforcement racist. That Trump's conflation was false was lost amid the initial headlines that the ad itself was racist. This reinforces for a lot of people that Democrats will continue to attack Republicans until we have open borders.
To be clear, it's doubtful that this is a part of some long-term strategy that Trump intricately designed to troll Democrats into embracing radical immigration policies. (They had already embraced those positions before former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was nominated — recall that she and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., both embraced a ""zero deportation"" position during the 2016 primaries.) But Trump knows how to read the room, and he's excelled in making the Left overreach. No matter how tonally questionable or factually wrong Trump's Bracamontes ad might be, it's a trap, and it's probably already worked."

“We’re going to be prepared. They are not coming into our country,” Mr. Trump said of the caravan of Central Americans now many hundreds of miles away and moving through Mexico.

President Trump said Wednesday that he is willing to send as many as 15,000 troops to the border in anticipation of a caravan of Central American migrants making its way north.
“As far as the caravan is concerned our military is out, we have about 5,000-8 [thousand], we’ll go up to anywhere between 10 [thousand] and 15,000 military personnel on top of border patrol, ICE and everybody else on the border,” he told reporters.

The Pentagon announced 5,200 active duty troops will be sent to the border on top of 2,100 National Guardsmen already assisting border patrol with tasks that do not include physically stopping illegal border crossers.
General Terrence O’Shaughnessy, the commander of U.S. Northern Command, said the number of troops would exceed 5,200 but did not specify by how much.
The caravan of about 3,500 mostly Honduran asylum seekers, who say they are fleeing crime and violence in their own gang-ridden countries, is still over 800 miles away. Most are traveling on foot, making it weeks before they would arrive at the U.S. border.

“The number of troops deployed will change each day as military forces flow into the operating area, but the initial estimate is that the DOD [Department of Defense] will have more than 7,000 troops supporting DHS [Department of Homeland Security] across California, Arizona and Texas,” the Pentagon said in a statement after Trump’s remarks.
The extra troops will “provide a range of assistance, including planning, engineering, transportation, logistics and medical support to the US Customs and Border Protection,” the Pentagon said.

“We don’t do stunts,” Defense Secretary James Mattis said when asked whether Trump’s inflated number of potential troops was a political stunt to rally supporters.
As Tuesday’s midterm congressional elections approach, Trump has raised the alarm about potentially dangerous elements mixed in with the refugees traveling in the caravan, an issue popular with his base.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he could send up to 15,000 troops to the U.S. border — nearly triple the 5,200 announced by the Defense Department, and nearly triple the number authorized to serve in Iraq.
Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House before departing for a campaign rally in Florida, Trump insisted that he is “not fear-mongering” by dispatching military forces to dissuade members of a migrant caravan from trying to come into the United States.

“We’ll go up to anywhere between 10 and 15,000 military personnel on top of border patrol, ICE, and everybody else at the border. Nobody’s coming in,” he said, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Immigration, he added, is a “very big and dangerous topic.”
Trump also claimed that the population of undocumented immigrants is two or three times the 2014 figure estimated by the Department of Homeland Security.
“We now have 25-30 million in this country illegally, not going to allow it, dangerous and unfair,” he said. “With that being said, I want people to come into our country, but they have to come legally and through merit.”
Homeland Security estimated that there were 12.1 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. in 2014, the most recent year for which official figures are available. A Yale study released last month suggested that there could be as many as 22 million undocumented immigrants in America, but its conclusions were challenged even by advocates for reducing immigration.
Just a week after George Soros, a Democratic activist and donor, received one of numerous mail bombs allegedly sent by a Trump supporter, the president said he thinks it’s possible Soros is funding the caravan of migrants — a claim for which there is no evidence.
“I wouldn't be surprised,” Trump said when asked whether Soros could be providing resources for the caravan. “A lot of people say yes.”"
2762,Trump Wants To Order End To Birthright Citizenship',HuffPost,10/30/2018,,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-executive-order-end-birthright-citizenship_us_5bd82b10e4b07427610ae4f4,"President Donald Trump said he’s considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who aren’t citizens ― a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment that could likely be changed only through a constitutional amendment.
Trump said in an interview with “Axios on HBO” taped Monday that he could execute the change via executive order.
“It was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don’t,” Trump said. “You can definitely do it with an act of Congress. But now they’re saying I can do it just with an executive order.”
He said the right awarded to babies born as birthright Americans is “ridiculous” and that the system “has to end.”
Trump also falsely stated that the U.S. is “the only country in the world” that offers citizenship to those born here. More than 30 nations, including Canada and Mexico, have similar policies.
It’s not clear what the executive order would look like or when it would be proposed ― if Trump follows through at all, considering his tendency for pre-election bluster and warnings he has received from fellow Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.), who have said doing so would be outside the bounds the president’s authority.
All babies born in the U.S. are American citizens under the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which cannot be changed by presidential order.
Changing that policy would dramatically reshape the U.S. ― effectively punishing the children of undocumented immigrants, whom Trump has vowed to remove from the country. Even if he doesn’t follow through or succeed, though, Trump’s vow to try aligns with other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants ahead of the midterm elections next Tuesday.
Exclusive: Trump to terminate birthright citizenship https://t.co/ckg0vs4T9O — Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) October 30, 2018
An executive order challenging birthright citizenship would ensure a legal battle, in which most experts think the president would fail. The Supreme Court ruled in 1898’s U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark that a child born in the U.S. to immigrant parents was a citizen under the 14th Amendment.
“The president cannot erase the Constitution with an executive order, and the 14th Amendment’s citizenship guarantee is clear,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. “This is a transparent and blatantly unconstitutional attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred in the days ahead of the midterms.”
Some Republicans ― including Ryan ― quickly shot down Trump’s idea. “You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order,” the House speaker said Tuesday on WVLK Radio, according to Bloomberg News reporter Erik Wasson.
Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) criticized the president’s statement, calling instead for immigration reform “that makes our country more secure and reaffirms our wonderful tradition as a nation of immigrants.”
Another Republican, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, also tweeted that such an executive order would not be possible.
A president cannot amend Constitution or laws via executive order. Concept of natural-born citizen in #14thAmendment derives from natural-born subject in Britain. Phrase “and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” excludes mainly foreign diplomats, who are not subject to U.S. laws. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) October 30, 2018
The are some experts who disagree. Axios cited John Eastman, a constitutional law professor at Chapman University and director of The Claremont Institute’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, who said the amendment has been misapplied and was not intended to apply to every person born in the U.S. regardless of parentage.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced Tuesday that he would introduce legislation “along the same lines as the proposed executive order from President Trump” to end birthright citizenship, a policy change he has supported for years. It’s unclear what his legislation would look like ― and he has previously suggested such a change would require a constitutional amendment.
“This policy is a magnet for illegal immigration, out of the mainstream of the developed world, and needs to come to an end,” Graham said in a statement on Tuesday.
Trump has long supported ending birthright citizenship, recommending in 2015 on the campaign trail that the country “start a process” to scrap it.
“I don’t think they have American citizenship and if you speak to some very, very good lawyers — and I know some will disagree — but many of them agree with me and you’re going to find they do not have American citizenship. Our country is going to hell,” Trump said then in an interview with CNN.
Every time you see a Caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our Country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic Immigration Laws!

The president has lasered in on immigration ahead of next week’s midterm elections, stoking fear about the caravan of migrants heading toward the U.S.-Mexico border from Central America. He has falsely claimed the caravan is stocked with criminals, gang members and Middle Eastern terrorists, and has threatened to cut off aid to Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, the countries where most of the migrants hail from.
He deployed 5,200 active-duty troops to the border on Monday in what officials of his administration described as a necessary national security measure.

3664,OPINION: Ending Birthright Citizenship Is No Panacea',Guest Writer - Right,10/30/2018,,,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/ending-birthright-citizenship-donald-trumps-immigration-plan/,"President Donald Trump delivers a speech in the White House East Room in Washington, D.C., June 29, 2018. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters )
According to Axios, President Trump is gearing up to sign an executive order that would, in their words, “remove the right to citizenship for babies of non-citizens born on U.S. soil.” There is some ambiguity in this formulation. Will the executive order in question limit birthright citizenship to the children of U.S. citizens, or will it extend citizenship to the children of lawful permanent residents, as in the case of most market democracies that have revised their birthright citizenship rules in recent decades? It is not clear from the video clip provided by Axios on HBO.

In truth, Trump’s response to reporter Jonathan Swan’s question seems rather off the cuff. At first, the president explains that while he once thought bringing an end to automatic birthright citizenship — presumably for the children of any class of non-citizens born in the U.S., whether legally present or otherwise — would require a constitutional amendment, he has since been persuaded that a statute would do, or even an executive order. Pressed by Swan as to whether such an executive order was in process of being drafted, Trump confidently replied that “it’s in the process, it’ll happen.” Will it happen, though? I’m skeptical.
First, I should stipulate that I have in the past argued for an amnesty for the long-settled unauthorized-immigrant population that would be accompanied by a constitutional amendment that would do two things: (a) grant Congress the authority to revise the rules around automatic birthright citizenship and (b) allow naturalized U.S. citizens who are otherwise eligible to serve as president. I’ve since changed my mind.
Advertisement
Though an amendment along these lines would have a hard time clearing the high hurdles we rightly put in the way of new constitutional amendments, it struck me as a tough-minded but ultimately fair way to address a serious and legitimate concern often raised by critics of an expansive amnesty: that such an amnesty would encourage further unauthorized inflows, future unauthorized immigrants would form families in the U.S. (including native-born citizen children), and these mixed-status households have long been among the most sympathetic cases, as most Americans are, for good reason, reluctant to divide families. If mixed-status households are a barrier to stringent enforcement, revising the rules around automatic birthright citizenship seemed like a legitimate solution — indeed, a solution that has in the past appealed to partisans of more open borders.
If you believe that opponents of an expansive amnesty ought to be anathematized, a sentiment often expressed by admissionists, addressing their concerns is an inciting thing to do in itself. I disagree. As the political scientists Matthew Wright, Morris Levy, and Jack Citrin have found, “opponents of legalization . . . often cast the issue in strict moral terms, regarding unlawful presence in the country as a blanket disqualification. To give any illegal immigrant a path to citizenship constitutes ‘amnesty,’ an act that transgresses respect for the law, rewards violators, and unjustly pushes aside those who have ‘played by the rules.’” Wright et al. are favorably disposed to legalization, as they call it, but they acknowledge that much of the opposition to it is driven by categorical moral judgments that can’t be reduced to, say, ethnic or racial bias, which is often cited as a driving force. (I discuss these and other related issues at greater length in Melting Pot or Civil War?) Revising automatic birthright citizenship so that it extends only to the children of citizens and lawful permanent residents is, in theory, a powerful signal that the next amnesty would be the last, not yet another amnesty in a long series of them that sap support for the rule of law.

Why have I changed my mind? It’s not because I believe that ending automatic birthright citizenship for the children of the unauthorized is offensive on its face. (As others have mentioned, many market democracies have revised their birthright-citizenship rules, and some of them have devised reasonable compromises, e.g., Australia’s 2007 citizenship law, which Peter Schuck and Rogers Smith recently discussed in National Affairs.) The short answer is that I am more confident we can make immigration enforcement much more effective via mandatory E-verify and focusing our efforts on recent violators, though it will require a political compromise, and I am more concerned about the issues raised by creating a large class of stateless persons. If we can greatly diminish future unauthorized flows, as I believe we can, we can shrink the number of mixed-status households. If we fail to do so, the countries of origin of unauthorized immigrants might refuse to grant citizenship to the offspring of their nationals, which would, I fear, precipitate a serious and lasting problem. It is never wise to give a foreign government that much power to sow chaos in our country. That is why getting enforcement right is so essential.

To return to President Trump’s remarks, I find it hard to believe the Trump White House would pursue an executive order ending automatic birthright citizenship for the children of the unauthorized. For one, the practical realities of implementing such a rule would be enormously complex, and it would face serious legal challenges right from the start. My impression is that this is yet another attempt by the president to telegraph that he takes controlling immigration seriously. The danger, however, is that Trump will further exacerbate the “thermostatic” reaction to his immigration rhetoric, i.e., the fact that the more hawkish the president comes across on the issue, the more moderates and liberals seem to take a more dovish line.

Consider the following from political scientist Daniel Hopkins, a leading expert on public opinion on immigration: “With Trump taking a more hard-line stance than Romney, we might have expected some Americans to likewise shift against a pathway to citizenship, but that’s not what happened,” observed Hopkins. “Instead, Republicans and Democrats alike became more pro-pathway between 2012 and 2016, and much of that uptick occurred during the 2016 campaign. This is a common phenomenon: When a politician advocates for a policy proposal, American opinion sometimes moves in the opposite direction.”
If Trump’s opposition to birthright citizenship becomes a salient issue, it is more likely to undermine the restrictionist cause than strengthen it."

The president expressed surprise that ""Axios on HBO"" knew about his secret plan: ""I didn't think anybody knew that but me. I thought I was the only one. ""
Behind the scenes: ""Axios on HBO"" had been working for weeks on a story on Trump’s plans for birthright citizenship, based on conversations with several sources, including one close to the White House Counsel’s office.
The legal challenges would force the courts to decide on a constitutional debate over the 14th Amendment, which says:
""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""
Be smart: Few immigration and constitutional scholars believe it is within the president's power to change birthright citizenship, former U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services chief counsel Lynden Melmed tells Axios.
But some conservatives have argued that the 14th Amendment was only intended to provide citizenship to children born in the U.S. to lawful permanent residents — not to unauthorized immigrants or those on temporary visas.
that the 14th Amendment was only intended to provide citizenship to children born in the U.S. to lawful permanent residents — not to unauthorized immigrants or those on temporary visas. John Eastman, a constitutional scholar and director of Chapman University's Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, told ""Axios on HBO"" that the Constitution has been misapplied over the past 40 or so years. He says the line ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" refers to people with full, political allegiance to the U.S. — such as green card holders and citizens.
Michael Anton, a former national security official in the Trump administration, recently took up this argument in the Washington Post.
Anton said that Trump could, via executive order, ""specify to federal agencies that the children of noncitizens are not citizens"" simply because they were born on U.S. soil. (It’s not yet clear whether Trump will take this maximalist argument, though his previous rhetoric suggests there’s a good chance.)

(It’s not yet clear whether Trump will take this maximalist argument, though his previous rhetoric suggests there’s a good chance.) But others — such as Judge James C. Ho, who was appointed by Trump to Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans — say the line in the amendment refers to the legal obligation to follow U.S. laws, which applies to all foreign visitors (except diplomats) and immigrants. He has written that changing how the 14th Amendment is applied would be ""unconstitutional.""
Between the lines: Until the 1960s, the 14th Amendment was never applied to undocumented or temporary immigrants, Eastman said.
Between 1980 and 2006, the number of births to unauthorized immigrants — which opponents of birthright citizenship call ""anchor babies"" — skyrocketed to a peak of 370,000, according to a 2016 study by Pew Research. It then declined slightly during and following the Great Recession.

But those who claim the 14th Amendment should not apply to everyone point to the fact that there has been no ruling on a case specifically involving immigrants in the country illegally or those with temporary legal status.
The bottom line: If Trump follows through on the executive order, ""the courts would have to weigh in in a way they haven't,"" Eastman said.

4330,Congress Must Act to Deter Future Caravans',National Review,10/27/2018,,,https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/10/central-american-caravan-illegal-immigration-congress-national-sovereignty/,"Central American migrants walk along the road in Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico, October 26, 2018. (Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters)
It’s the only way to meet the challenge to our national sovereignty posed by illegal immigration.
King Leonidas had his 300. President Trump has his 800. That’s the number of soldiers Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has ordered to the southern border to greet the caravan of illegal immigrants originating from Honduras. The band of families and singles, traveling en masse to avoid exploitation by smugglers and coyotes, now numbers 10,000 souls, according to one report. It may take them weeks to reach the United States. A second caravan is already taking shape behind the first. It won’t be the last.
Advertisement
An unauthorized march on a border — any border — is a challenge to national sovereignty. And it is precisely the idea of sovereignty that one of the groups supporting the caravan, Pueblo Sin Fronteras, wants to undermine. The confrontation is all the more emphatic when the men at the head of the column bear the flag not of the country they seek to enter but that of their homeland. Americans who oppose illegal immigration and are concerned at the mounting crisis in our border states, where thousands of family units and unaccompanied children are detained as an inundated bureaucracy decides their fates, look to Trump, Mattis, and the Army for relief.
Prepare to be disappointed. The soldiers aren’t going to the border to stop the caravan. They’re going to assist Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Health and Human Services, and other authorities as they take in the newcomers. There is little the government can do to turn back the tide. Why? Because the same rule of law challenged by illegal immigration also incentivizes and protects the illegal immigrants within the caravan. It’s a paradox — one inflaming this most polarizing of issues at a moment of political decision.
Advertisement
The military can’t solve the problem. But Congress can. Only the legislative branch has the authority to close the loopholes through which the most recent illegal migration has passed: a portion of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act that limits the ability of law enforcement to repatriate swiftly unaccompanied children from noncontiguous (read: Central American) nations; the 1997 Flores settlement that put a ceiling on how long the government can detain these children; and the “credible fear” standard by which illegal immigrants may request asylum proceedings simply by saying they are afraid to return to Tegucigalpa or Quetzaltenango.
These three provisions, along with changing political conditions in Central America, have transformed the character of illegal immigration. The American public still conceives of the illegal immigrant as a young, single male from Mexico looking for economic opportunity in the United States. That is no longer the case. The population of Mexicans living illegally in the United States has declined in recent years because of rising living standards in Mexico and U.S. immigration officials becoming quite skilled at apprehension and repatriation. The new illegal immigration isn’t made up of single males looking to become day laborers. It’s families harassed by gangs and encouraged by left-wing politicians to flee to safety — and perhaps join family — in the north.
Advertisement
Advertisement
Which is why, though the number of illegal immigrants from Mexico fell, the overall figure stabilized. (And that population could be much larger than we think.) At the beginning of the 21st century, 98 percent of the individuals Border Patrol apprehended were from Mexico. Today, 60 percent are from Central America.
Our first taste of the changing nature of illegal immigration — and harbinger of our Europeanized politics of national identity — was the child migration of 2014. The inauguration of Donald Trump seems to have deterred illegal border crossings. Not for long. By spring 2018, the first caravan was on its way. This latest wave grew in strength.
Advertisement
Its very nature makes it that much more difficult to counteract. Not just because there are children involved, but because of our national self-image as the refuge of free peoples. The humanitarian instinct is a powerful force in American immigration policy: Look at the backlash to family separations resulting from the administration’s zero-tolerance policy earlier this year as well as to the State Department’s cap on refugee admissions. Our moral imagination asks us to put ourselves in the shoes of these families, denizens of failed states that offer neither personal nor economic security, lured here by the promise of a better future, and encouraged by cynical politicians and non-governmental organizations eager to strike a blow against “The Empire” and its president.
But humanitarianism only gets you so far. In this case, our desire to help strangers unintentionally contributed to a mounting crisis that benefits no nation. And to which we have not responded adequately. Yes, calling in the Army is fine. The agencies on the ground need help. What they ultimately require, however, is congressional action.

Amend the 2008 law to accelerate repatriations, address Flores in legislation that permits indefinite detention of family units, and tighten the standards for asylum.

2042,Defense Secretary Approves Sending More Troops to Mexican Border',Wall Street Journal - News,10/27/2018,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/mattis-approves-sending-more-troop-to-mexican-border-1540566532,"The U.S. defense secretary on Friday approved a request to deploy additional U.S. troops along the U.S.-Mexico border, fulfilling President Trump’s vow to use the American military in an expanding campaign to stop a caravan of migrants and asylum seekers.
The military deployment is part of a new round of administration action on immigration that includes a threat by the Trump administration to seal border entry ports to migrants, including asylum seekers.

4564,TRUMP WORRIED MIGRANT CARAVAN IS NOT DOING ENOUGH TO RILE UP THE BASE BEFORE THE MIDTERMS',Vanity Fair,10/27/2018,,,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/trump-caravan-border,"Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, was expected to sign papers in the coming days to send the troops. They will include engineers to help with the construction of tents and fencing, doctors for medical support, and potentially some personnel to operate drones along the border, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the deployment had not yet been finished.
American immigration law says that people arriving at ports of entry on the United States border have a right to seek asylum, as do those apprehended crossing the border without authorization, if they are able to demonstrate a “credible fear” of returning home. But President Border Wall, who has no idea how the law actually works, has painted those fleeing violence and persecution, and those simply thumbing their noses at immigration laws for yuks, as one and the same. “To those in the Caravan, turnaround, [sic] we are not letting people into the United States illegally,” Trump wrote on Twitter Thursday. “Go back to your Country and if you want, apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing!” (As many have pointed out, it’s unlikely that the Spanish-speaking asylum seekers have the Wi-Fi necessary to read this message, which almost makes it appear as though it was actually addressed to his base.)
Human-rights and immigrant advocacy groups have unsurprisingly panned Trump’s transparent attempt to instill fear in voters just before the midterm elections. “The approach of a caravan of migrants that includes refugees fleeing persecution and violence is not a crisis, but President Trump is yet again spreading hatred and fear, hoping to score political points by making Americans fear refugees,” Mike Breen, the chief executive of Human Rights First, told The New York Times. Meanwhile, when asked if “there was any scenario [in which] people [who] force their way across the border could be shot at,” Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News, “We do not have any intention right now to shoot at people,” emphasis ours, because that sure sounds like a roundabout way of saying Some people might get shot—who knows!

Trump’s trade war is totally going according to plan! Nothing is f--ked!
When Donald Trump launched his trade war with China, he promised that the pain of slapping tariffs on billions of dollars worth of imports—and the ensuing retaliatory levies on U.S. goods—would all be worth it for the avalanche of jobs to which the putative measures would lead. And for once in his presidency, he may have been right! There’s a good chance new jobs will come out of all of this . . . in China. Per *The New York Times:*"
4105,Trump is considering a new \xe2\x80\x9ctravel ban\xe2\x80\x9d aimed at the migrant caravan',Vox,10/26/2018,,,https://www.vox.com/2018/10/26/18025768/trump-migrant-caravan-ban-asylum,"The Trump administration is reportedly considering using executive action to prevent people traveling in the migrant “caravan” from presenting themselves for asylum at the US-Mexico border.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are developing a plan that mimics the “travel ban” from 2017, the San Francisco Chronicle and other media outlets reported Thursday night: President Donald Trump would issue a proclamation preventing a certain “class” of people from being allowed to enter the US. It’s not yet clear how that “class” would be defined, but it would target either the “caravan” in particular or asylum-seekers more broadly.
It’s legal to seek asylum without papers, and the US government is obligated under international law not to send anyone back to a country where they are at risk of persecution due to race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or membership in a social group.
But the Trump administration appears to be laying the groundwork for a plan that would simply bar people from entering the US — presumably keeping Central American asylum-seekers on the Mexican side of the border.
The US government has already been restricting access at official US border crossings and requiring would-be asylum-seekers to wait before being allowed to enter, claiming space constraints at ports of entry.
The “caravan” of about 5,000 people, which originally set off from Honduras on October 12, is still weeks from the US-Mexico border. It is not going to arrive before the November 6 midterm elections, and it is already shrinking as caravan members decide to apply for asylum in Mexico or return to their home countries instead.
However, the Trump administration is in overdrive to respond to what Trump has called a “National Emergency.” The US is already sending 800 troops to the US-Mexico border to provide logistical support for Customs and Border Protection agents.
The proposal (or proposals) reported Thursday night are still under discussion. It’s not clear when or if the White House will act on them. If Trump does take executive action to ban entries in the name of stopping the caravan, though, it’s almost certainly going to attract another court challenge over executive authority to stop people from entering the US — and may well prevent many, many Central American asylum-seekers who aren’t in the caravan from being allowed into the US to make their case.
Here’s what we know:
The plan reported by the San Francisco Chronicle (which matches a plan Vox has heard is in the works) would have two parts.
The first step in the plan would be to publish a regulation barring asylum claims from anyone who’s subject to a presidential ban issued under section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. That provision, also used in the travel ban, allows the president to “suspend the entry” of a “class of aliens” if he determines their entry would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States.”
a regulation barring asylum claims from anyone who’s subject to a presidential ban issued under section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. That provision, also used in the travel ban, allows the president to “suspend the entry” of a “class of aliens” if he determines their entry would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States.” The Trump administration has already been working on such a regulation as part of a broader package of asylum regulations being reviewed at DOJ and DHS.
Instead of going through the normal process (which takes several months), however, the regulation barring asylum for banned immigrants would be issued as an “interim final rule” — allowing the government to enforce it while it goes through the review process.
The regulation, which could be issued as soon as Friday, would not change anything on its own. It would have to be issued before the ban itself went into effect.
As early as Monday or Tuesday, the president could sign a ban that refused entry to some class of people under the 212(f) provision. At that point, those people would also not be allowed to apply for asylum.
But there are still a lot of unknowns in this process. Here’s what we don’t know:
Whether other, broader executive actions are also being considered. The New York Times reported that plans were under development to “close the southern border” — which implies refusing not only asylum-seekers, but all people or goods seeking to cross from Mexico into the US. This is a much broader proposal than the one the San Francisco Chronicle reported on (and the one Vox has heard about). It’s not at all clear what the legal vehicle for such a move would be.
Exactly who would be banned under this plan. The ban could cover only members of the caravan currently traveling through southern Mexico (although it’s not clear how the government would know who exactly had been part of the caravan and who wasn’t). Alternatively, it could cover all asylum-seekers from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador — the “Northern Triangle” countries driving asylum-seekers to the US — or even all asylum-seekers generally.
How much advance notice the government would give before implementing the ban, and when it would go into effect. Thousands of Central American asylum seekers present themselves to US officials every month. A broad ban would be far harder to enforce than even the first version of the travel ban in January 2017 — whose rollout was famously disastrous. Without training time, this ban could make that one look like a smooth and efficient government operation.
Who, if anyone, has signed off on this plan, and whether it will ultimately be approved.
Whether the ban could survive a legal challenge. In upholding the final version of Trump’s travel ban in June in the case Trump v. Hawaii, the Supreme Court (in an opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts) made it clear that the president’s power to ban immigrants under 212(f) is extremely broad. At the same time, however, the opinion pointed to the national security reasons offered for the ban, and the careful process by which it was drafted, as evidence that it was legitimate government policy and not just driven by the whims of Trump.
It’s hard to imagine a caravan ban would look as well-thought-out — not least because there’s no evidence that anyone in the caravan poses a security threat, or that the caravan, should it arrive at the border, wouldn’t just line up at a port of entry to seek asylum legally.
The right to seek asylum isn’t just a matter of international law but of the 1980 Refugee Act. Whether US law allows a president to refuse someone the power to seek asylum through a proclamation isn’t entirely clear. It’s a question that the Supreme Court will almost certainly have to consider if this plan is put into effect."
5150,Trump mulls plan to bar entry of all migrants at US-Mexico border',Fox News (Online),10/26/2018,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-mulls-plan-to-bar-entry-of-all-migrants-at-us-mexico-border,"President Trump is considering a sweeping executive order that would block migrants, including asylum seekers, from entering the U.S. at the southern border in a bid to stop the caravan traveling north through Mexico.
The White House, if it goes ahead with the measure, would issue new regulations restricting certain migrants from seeking asylum. The rules would effectively block most if not all the migrants who are taking part in the caravan, Politico first reported.
Fox News has learned the proposal originated out of the White House and is one of several being considered. No final decision has been made.
“The Administration is considering a wide range of administrative, legal and legislative options to address the Democrat-created crisis of mass illegal immigration. No decisions have been made at this time. Nor will we forecast to smugglers or caravans what precise strategies will or will not be deployed,” a White House official said.
The order would be akin to Trump's previous aggressive immigration-blocking executive orders, such as the travel ban aimed at halting people from some Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.
Any attempt to block the entry of Central American migrants is likely to prompt legal challenges, though Trump is likely emboldened following a Supreme Court ruling earlier this summer that affirmed the president’s right to bar the entry of migrants who “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.”
The plan for the executive order comes just in the final stretch before the upcoming midterm elections, with Trump trying to make the issue of caravan the defining topic as voters head to the polls.
""Every time you see a caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws!"" Trump wrote in a tweet Monday. ""Remember the midterms!""
Hundreds of U.S. troops are also set to make their way to the southern border to help Homeland Security and the National Guard as the caravan pushes north.
An official told Fox News on Thursday roughly 800 soldiers will be sent to the area to offer “logistical support,"" including providing tents and vehicles.
It’s not immediately clear which units are being tasked with the mission as details are still being finalized. There are currently 2,100 National Guard troops on the southern border assisting Homeland Security.
Democrats, while previously outspoken regarding Trump’s immigration policies, are staying largely silent on the issue, instead preferring to remain focused on tackling the GOP on issues like health care, saying it’s the winning issue this election cycle.
DEMOCRATS AVOID SPARRING WITH TRUMP ON CARAVAN AS MIDTERM NEARS
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrats in the country, slammed Trump in a statement earlier this week regarding the caravan of migrants, saying the president is “desperate” to change the conversation because “health care is the number one issue Americans care about.”
According to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey published last week, which surveyed people since the beginning of the caravan earlier this month, the issue of immigration isn’t the top concern for voters. It ranks below health care, which has consistently been viewed as the most important issue. Other key issues have been the economy, jobs and policies concerning gun rights.

3552,"Trump Considering Travel-Ban-Style Order to Bar Migrants, Source Says'",Bloomberg,10/26/2018,,,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-26/trump-is-said-to-consider-travel-ban-style-order-to-bar-migrants,"LISTEN TO ARTICLE 5:58 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email
The Trump administration is considering an order to block the entry of migrants at the southern border, using the same authority as its earlier travel ban, a person familiar with the matter said, as thousands of Central Americans make their way toward the U.S.
The action, if implemented, would effectively bar those seeking asylum from entering the country. President Donald Trump is weighing a range of options designed to prevent undocumented migrants from crossing the U.S.-Mexican frontier, said a White House official familiar with the discussions. Both people spoke on condition of anonymity as no final decision has been made.
The travel ban, announced shortly after Trump took office in 2017, affected people from seven countries, five of them with Muslim majorities. The executive order now being looked at would deny asylum claims based on national security concerns, and would give broad authority to officials at the border, the person said.
The New York Times reported late Thursday that the administration was considering an order that would bar migrants, including those requesting asylum, who try to enter the country from Mexico, a significant escalation of presidential power on immigration policy.
Midterm Elections
The White House official wouldn’t confirm the Times report and others, saying that several legal, executive and legislative remedies were on the table.
Trump has made undocumented immigration a front-burner issue in the weeks before the midterm congressional elections on Nov. 6. He’s blamed Democrats for the so-called caravan of Central American migrants headed through Mexico after starting off in Honduras.
“Every time you see a Caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our Country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats,” Trump said Oct. 22 on Twitter, one of three tweets this week referencing the caravan.
Trump also claimed that “ unknown Middle Easterners” were blended in with the thousands of Central Americans, but later said that there was no evidence to support that assertion.
The Trump administration plans to send at least 800 additional troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a third person familiar with the deliberations.
The Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security confirmed late Friday plans for U.S. Northern Command to send more troops to the border, without saying how many.
In a joint statement, the departments said soldiers will help with planning, engineering support -- such as “temporary barriers, barricades, and fencing” -- and support for Custom and Border Protection agents including providing them with aircraft, medical teams, temporary housing and protective equipment.
Where Now for Migrant Caravan as Trump Tweets Threats: QuickTake
The president has also threatened to cut off U.S. aid to three Central American countries -- Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador -- over the migrants heading toward the U.S.
‘Racism-Driven Cruelty’
The Times article, citing sources it didn’t identify, said that details of the possible executive order were still in the planning stages and that whatever emerged was sure to be met with legal challenges.
Officials at the National Immigration Law Center, which participated in the earlier legal challenge to Trump’s travel ban, said it is prepared to fight a new order if Trump moves ahead. Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the center, said that the White House’s consideration of such action shows that Trump’s “racism-driven cruelty has no bounds.”
“We will use every tool to stop Trump from undermining the Constitution and international laws and from instituting his administration’s agenda to impose a Latin ban in any form,” Hincapie said in a statement.
American Civil Liberties Union immigration rights director Omar Jadwat said it was “disgraceful” that the administration “would even consider what’s being reported.”
‘Moral Failure’
“It would mean refusing to protect people who can prove they are fleeing persecution,” Jadwat said in a statement. “That would be a huge moral failure and any plan along these lines will be subject to intense legal scrutiny.”
But Peter Spiro, an immigration law professor at Temple University, said that courts could uphold the president’s potential actions. In June, a sharply divided Supreme Court upheld Trump’s ban on travel from the seven countries. The restrictions indefinitely bar more than 150 million people from entering the U.S.
“Most experts would agree about the restrictions now being contemplated: they make no sense from a policy perspective,” Spiro said. “But just because a ban on asylum applicants would be stupid and cruel doesn’t mean the Supreme Court would strike it down.”
The troops that Trump is sending to the border would join 2,100 National Guard troops who were previously deployed to perform support duties for Department of Homeland Security personnel.
Trump said on Twitter on Thursday that he was “bringing out the military for this National Emergency” and promised immigrants unlawfully crossing the border “will be stopped!”
Earlier: Trump Gambles With Immigration Attack to Spur Midterm Voters
Cutting aid to the Central American countries is complicated. Much of the money for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras was appropriated by Congress in the form of anti-corruption and good-governance programs. Those initiatives have broad support from lawmakers, who’ve already promised to put up a fight should Trump try to make good on his threat.
The migrants began crossing into southern Mexico on Oct. 20, avoiding that country’s migration authorities and federal police by jumping off the border bridge crossing the Suchiate River, or by crossing the river in improvised rafts made of tires and boards, according to images from El Financiero Bloomberg TV.
Under standard U.S. procedures, the migrants, assuming they reached and attempted to cross the U.S. border, would be detained for not having the required documents, and asked whether they’re afraid of returning to their home.
A person who answered “no” would not be admitted into the U.S. One who expressed fear of persecution or torture would be interviewed by an asylum officer to establish whether there is credible fear of persecution.
Michael J. Bars, a spokesman for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in an email that the “extremely low bar” for establishing credible fear allows economic migrants to abuse the system by posing as asylum seekers, then disappear before their court dates to live illegally in the U.S.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is planning to dispatch at least 800 active duty troops to the southern border at the direction of a president who has sought to transform fears about immigration into electoral gains in the midterms as a caravan of thousands of migrants makes its way through Mexico.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is expected to sign an order sending the troops to the border, bolstering National Guard forces already there, an official said Thursday. The action comes as President Donald Trump has spent recent days calling attention to the caravan of Central Americans slowly making their way by foot into southern Mexico, but still more than 1,000 miles from U.S. soil.

Trump, who made fear about immigrants a major theme of his 2016 election campaign, has been eager to make it a top issue heading into the Nov. 6 midterm elections, which will determine control of Congress. The president and senior White House officials have long believed the issue is key to turning out his base of supporters.
The additional troops would provide logistical and other support to the Border Patrol, said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a plan that had not been finalized and formally announced.
It’s not unusual for the National Guard to help with border security. Active duty troops, however, are rarely deployed within the United States except for domestic emergencies like hurricanes or floods. Fears of militarizing the border were fanned by a May 1997 incident in which a Marine on a counter-narcotics mission shot to death an 18-year-old who was herding goats in Redford, Texas.
Troops being sent at Trump’s direction would not be on armed security missions. They would assist the Border Patrol by providing things such as vehicles, tents and equipment. There already are about 2,000 National Guard members there under a previous Pentagon arrangement.
Trump has used the caravan to bolster his election-season warnings that the U.S. is being infiltrated by illegal immigrants “pouring across the border,” whom he has painted with a sinister brush.
He has claimed, without any apparent basis in fact, that “Middle Easterners” were among the group. At rallies and on Twitter, Trump has tried to portray the Democrats as pro-illegal immigration, even claiming, with no evidence, that Democrats organized the caravan.

He tweeted Thursday that, “Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the border” and said he was using the military to respond to what he called a “National Emergency.”
The migrants in the sprawling caravan — once estimated by the United Nations to number more than 7,000 — are hoping to make it to the United States. Most are Hondurans, seeking to escape poverty and violence, and include families with children.
The caravan swelled dramatically soon after crossing the Mexican border on Oct. 19, but sickness, fear and police harassment have whittled down its numbers.
Trump tweeted a direct message to the migrants Thursday, urging them to return home.
“To those in the Caravan, turnaround,” he wrote. “We are not letting people into the United States illegally. Go back to your Country and if you want, apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing!”
The migrants have largely been disconnected from news reports about them. When asked about Trump’s tweets, they have generally responded that he should stop attacking them and said they would keep heading north.
Candy Guillermo, a 37-year-old migrant in the caravan who had heard about the plan to deploy troops, was surprised she and the children in group would be considered a threat. “Trump should be more humanitarian,” she said. “We only want to give our kids a better future.”
Migrants who do reach the U.S. border can claim asylum under U.S. and international law. Those who clear an initial screening are often released until their cases are decided in immigration court, which can take several years.
The U.S. had 331,700 asylum claims in 2017, more than any country in the world, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency. That’s nearly double the asylum claims the U.S. fielded in 2015 and nearly quadruple the claims in 2013.
Trump ordered the deployment of the National Guard earlier this year to respond to a spike in illegal crossings. Those troops are under the control of state governors and are limited to support roles such as providing surveillance.
The planned deployment of active duty troops is in response to a request from the Department of Homeland Security, which manages the Border Patrol, a U.S. official said.
DHS asked for help in various forms, the official said, including air transport and other logistical assistance. It was not immediately clear why active duty forces were sought because National Guard troops can perform the same functions. Earlier this year Mattis authorized Pentagon funding for up to 4,000 National Guard troops on the border and thus far only a little over 2,000 have been used.
Federal law prohibits the use of active duty service members for law enforcement inside the U.S. unless specifically authorized by Congress.
Trump seemed to hint at the troop announcement to a rally in Wisconsin on Wednesday. “Wait’ll you see what happens over the next couple of weeks. You’re going to see a very secure border,” he said. “You just watch.”

5175,Pentagon to send active-duty troops to U.S.-Mexico border',Washington Times,10/25/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/25/pentagon-deploy-more-troops-us-mexico-border/,"The Trump administration will send about 800 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border ahead of the illegal immigrant caravan, a defense official confirmed Thursday, following through on President Trump’s pledge.
Most of the troops will be active-duty Army soldiers who specialize in support operations such as logistics and engineering. Medical staff also will be part of the deployment, with an Air Force contingent assisting in aerial evacuations.
They will join more than 2,000 National Guard troops already in the region, deployed in April as a previous caravan was testing the border.
It was not clear Thursday what operational gains will come from adding active-duty troops to the mix, but it makes good on a declaration Mr. Trump made over the past week that he wanted to mobilize the regular military, not just the Guard.
“You’re going to see a very secure border. You just watch,” Mr. Trump told supporters at a political rally in Wisconsin Wednesday night. “The military is ready. They’re all set.”
Turning to Pentagon brass to solve problems has been a theme for Mr. Trump during his time in office.
The Guard troops he asked for earlier this year are helping with surveillance to detect illegal crossings and with clerical and mechanical work, with a goal of freeing border agents and officers to get into the field.
Guard troops are not involved in patrolling or arresting illegal immigrants or smugglers.
From the description officials have given of the latest deployment, it does not appear that will change.
That makes it unlikely the infusion of personnel will deter the migrant caravan streaming north through Mexico.
While public estimates say the caravan has at least 5,000 people, Mexican officials put it closer to 3,630, most of them from Honduras.
They left their home country two weeks ago and made it to Guatemala. Some broke into Mexico, while others are still in Guatemala trying to figure out their path forward.
Guatemalan officials rescued seven unaccompanied children who were being smuggled inside the migrant caravan, Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, reported Thursday.
The group said the smugglers have been arrested and the children have been taken into custody by authorities and are being given welfare checks.
“This caravan deal presents an opportunity for incredible criminal activity,” said Chris Farrell, Judicial Watch’s director of investigations, who returned from Central America, where he spent time tracking the caravan.
He said he saw among the caravan men with Gothic-script “MS” tattoos, which would likely make them members of the violent MS-13 gang that Mr. Trump has said infiltrated the caravan.
He also saw what Border Patrol agents refer to as “special interest aliens” — those from countries outside the usual set of nations that send economic migrants.
Mr. Trump has said Middle Easterners in the caravan could be trouble.
If the caravan follows the lead of previous migrants from Central America, many will make asylum claims in the U.S. If they pass their initial screening, they will be admitted and likely released into the community to await a full hearing. Most will then disappear into the shadows, not bothering to follow through on their cases, authorities said during the April caravan.
The latest announcement of a troop deployment angered liberal activists, who called it a “desperate political stunt.”
“All Americans should be concerned about Trump’s increasingly frantic attempts to stir up animosity and incite violence against people of color, the media and his political opponents,” said Heidi Hess, co-director of CREDO Action.
Republicans, though, said the president was right to stiffen America’s response to the caravan.
“President Trump’s use of military force to protect America’s southern border is mandated by the commander in chief’s oath of office and constitutional duties,” said Rep. Mo Brooks, Alabama Republican.

6296,"Migrant caravan overwhelms Mexican authorities, moves on toward U.S.'",Washington Times,10/22/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/21/migrant-caravan-pushes-into-mexico/,"The combined efforts of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and the U.S. were not enough to deter thousands of migrants who broke through barricades or swam into Mexico over the weekend, defying their home government’s calls for them to return and America’s warnings that their journey is futile.
Local leaders say hundreds of people who were part of the migrant caravan have given up their journey and are returning to their homes in Honduras and Guatemala. But perhaps 2,000 others entered Mexico illegally and vowed to cross that country, with the U.S. their goal.
Saying they weren’t content to wait for authorities to process and admit them in smaller groups, they overcame Mexican police who had been deployed to try to prevent the mass entry.
“We are going to reach the United States,” Erasmo Duarte, a migrant from Danli, Honduras, told The Associated Press. “We couldn’t wait because we had already waited too long and they only told us lies.”
Local news reports said once the migrants broke into Mexico, authorities there did not try to stop them. They left the migrants to prepare for the long journey across the country and to the U.S., where they plan to test the administration’s resolve.
President Trump on Sunday called the caravan a “disgrace” and blamed Democrats, federal courts and the migrants themselves.
“Full efforts are being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our [southern] border,” he tweeted. “People have to apply for asylum in Mexico first, and if they fail to do that, the U.S. will turn them away. The courts are asking the U.S. to do things that are not doable!”
Earlier in the weekend, Mr. Trump told reporters that he would send the military — and not just the National Guard — to the border if need be.
That plan would create a number of legal entanglements, though the president’s suggestion of a military option served to underscore his frustration with the situation and the lack of tools the U.S. has to counter determined migrants willing to make the trip and prepared to demand asylum, whether deserving or not.
Mexican authorities have taken a firmer stand against this caravan than the one that traversed the country in the spring — partly at the urging of Mr. Trump, who threatened to cancel the trade deal he is planning with Mexico unless officials block entry.
The Mexican government said the migrants would have to apply for entry, and only those with passports would be granted travel permission. Others who had a case for asylum would be allowed to make it.
Those restrictions were too onerous for many migrants, for whom Mexico is a hurdle to be surmounted as they reach for their real goal of taking jobs in the U.S. or reuniting with family already in the country — usually illegally.
The caravan began in San Pedro Sula, a Honduran city known as one of the most violent places in the world. It grew steadily as it made its way through Honduras and Guatemala to as many as 5,000 people by some estimates.
Caravan members say they are fleeing gang violence at home and looking for jobs in the U.S. — neither of which has traditionally been enough reason to win asylum on its own.
But thanks to court rulings and generous U.S. laws, it’s easy to make an unworthy claim, and migrants making those claims are usually released into the interior of the U.S., where they disappear into the shadows with an estimated 11 million other illegal immigrants.
Mr. Trump has been complaining about that situation for months. His administration has suggested several changes, including holding illegal immigrants until they can be deported and allowing bogus asylum claims to be denied at a quicker pace.
Those proposals have not gotten traction among congressional Democrats, who view those changes as anti-immigrant.
Migration is just as controversial in Mexico, where President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he will ask Mr. Trump to pony up more money to try to build Central American society and create jobs in Mexico, hoping to stem the flow of people to the U.S.
He said the migrants’ rights must be protected as they break into Mexico and head north.
Amnesty International also called on Latin American governments to let people enter and apply for protections.
“The Mexican government should put the human rights of the caravan members at the heart of the response and not let the U.S. Trump administration’s pressure prevent it from fulfilling its international obligations,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, the organization’s director for the region.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen warned Sunday that the illegal immigrant caravan could be exploited by the cartels that control most of the illegal flow of people through Latin America.
The ease of entering the U.S. is a selling point for the cartels, which control the drug and human smuggling routes and require payment of a “mafia fee” just to cross the U.S.-Mexico boundary line.
Court records show that fee typically runs from $1,000 to $2,000. That doesn’t include thousands of dollars in other fees that cover foot guides, drivers, stash houses and the rest of the illegal journey.
“While we closely monitor the caravan crisis, we must remain mindful of the transnational criminal organizations and other criminals that prey on the vulnerabilities of those undertaking the irregular migration journey,” Ms. Nielsen said in a statement Sunday.
She repeated U.S. backing for the governments that have tried to stem the flow.
“We fully support the efforts of Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico, as they seek to address this critical situation and ensure a safer and more secure region,” the secretary said.

5376,Trump Threatens to Cut Aid to Central American Nations Over Migrant Caravan',Wall Street Journal - News,10/22/2018,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-threatens-to-cut-aid-to-central-american-nations-over-migrant-caravan-1540217440,"TAPACHULA, Mexico—An estimated 5,000 Honduran migrants—some on foot carrying children and some hitching rides on trucks—set out Monday from southern Mexico on a grueling journey toward the U.S. border, as President Trump threatened to end or cut foreign aid to Central American countries for failing to stop the caravan.
The caravan’s 11-day march through Honduras and Guatemala and into Mexico has fueled a fresh political rift between Mr. Trump and those countries’ leaders just two weeks before U.S. midterm elections.

In recent campaign rallies, Trump has sought to rally conservatives by asserting falsely that Democrats are in favor of “open borders” and that they favor increased crime.

“All Democrats fault for weak laws!” Trump wrote in one tweet, adding later: “Can you believe this, and what Democrats are allowing to be done to our Country?” The second tweet included a video clip of unknown origin that showed men, speaking Spanish, handing out slips of paper to people in lines carrying bags. The footage was identical to a clip posted by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who claimed it showed cash payments to Hondurans to join the caravan and suggested, without evidence, that the money came from a Democratic megadonor.
Republicans are facing a difficult election on Nov. 6, with polls showing Democrats holding an advantage on the general ballot and prognosticators favoring them to win control of the House. As pressure mounts, nerves have begun to fray inside the White House, with national security adviser John Bolton and Chief of Staff John F. Kelly engaging in a shouting match over immigration just outside the Oval Office on Thursday, according to White House aides.
Bolton had accused Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen of not doing enough to stem the surge in border crossings, and Kelly, who preceded Nielsen in the homeland security job and handpicked her as his successor, came to her defense, aides said. They described the argument as profane and loud enough to draw stares from others in the West Wing.

A White House official said Nielsen came to Bolton’s office after the fight and the two had a positive conversation about her department and the border.
While some GOP leaders in the House had initially hoped to focus their election message on the economy, Trump has continued to highlight immigration, confident that his hard-line views on enforcement will motivate his base and carry significant crossover appeal to independent and moderate voters who helped him win in 2016.
Many Republican candidates, especially in Senate races in states Trump won in 2016, have modeled attack ads on Trump’s rhetoric, aiming to raise public fears over the dangers of illegal immigration. Recent polls show that voters in both parties rank immigration among the top issues that will affect their choices in next month’s elections.

“The border is a big issue for Republican base voters who are already energized after Kavanaugh,” said Chris Wilson, a ­Republican pollster working on battleground races, referring to the contentious Supreme Court confirmation battle over Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. “A reminder that illegal immigration is a real problem and that we just don’t know who is entering our country can only boost Republican interest.”
Democrats dismissed Trump’s accusations as a sign of weakness from a president desperate to escape electoral consequences for failing to make good on his signature campaign promise to reduce illegal immigration.
Border Patrol agents arrested more than 16,000 immigrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border in September, the highest total on record and an increase of 80 percent since July, when Trump reversed his administration’s policy of separating immigrant children from their parents after a public outcry.

In all, more than 107,000 family members were taken into custody in fiscal 2018, obliterating the previous high of just under 78,000 in 2016.
“It’s pretty clear that the things this administration has attempted to address the situation at the border are failing,” said Cecilia Muñoz, an analyst at the think tank New America who served as a White House domestic policy adviser in the Obama administration. “As is typical, this president is trying to lay the blame elsewhere.”
The immigration increase this year, after a sharp drop in the first six months of his presidency, has complicated Trump’s immigration message. In response, he has exhorted aides to enact more extreme policies, including making it more difficult for immigrants to seek asylum protections and measures aimed at increasing criminal prosecutions of unauthorized border-crossers.

The White House is also considering a new policy, known as “binary choice,” which would detain migrant families together and give parents a choice — stay in immigration jail with their child for months or years as their asylum case proceeds, or allow their child to be assigned to a government shelter while a relative or guardian can apply to gain custody.
In his tweets Thursday, Trump aimed to ramp up pressure on foreign governments.
“In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught — and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!” Trump said in one tweet.
AD
In another, he suggested that the “onslaught” of immigrants could undermine a recently announced reworked trade deal with Mexico and Canada, writing that immigration is “far more important to me, as President, than Trade.”
AD
The new deal, which replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement, has yet to be signed by the three countries. Congress is not expected to ratify it before next year.
In recent years, Mexico has detained and deported far more Central Americans attempting to cross Mexico on the way to the United States. Still, Mexico’s southern border with Guatemala remains relatively easy for migrants to cross.
In the wake of Trump’s warnings, the Mexican government signaled that it would take a more restrictive stance on the caravan of migrants this time. Planeloads of federal police have arrived at Mexico’s southern border and are positioned at crossing points. The Mexican Foreign Ministry requested assistance Thursday from the U.N. Refugee Agency in processing Central American refu­gee claims.

The incoming government of Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who takes office in December, campaigned on a softer approach to migrants, saying that protecting their human rights should be a top priority and that they shouldn’t be treated like criminals.
AD
But in response to the latest caravan from Honduras, said to number up to 4,000 people, top officials on López Obrador’s transition team have suggested that they would move to block such large groups of people.
“Mexico can’t say that any caravan can pass to the United States,” Marcelo Ebrard, the incoming foreign minister, said Thursday on Mexican radio.
Mexican government leaders are “trying to perform a very difficult balancing act — on one hand with Trump watching and on the other hand with the Mexican population watching,” said Carlos Bravo Regidor, a professor at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City.

Immigration is likely to be discussed Friday when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is scheduled to meet with outgoing Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto.
In Washington, no matter how the midterm elections play out, the issue could come to a head in December.

Trump had threatened to force a partial government shutdown in the fall to force Congress to authorize billions of dollars for his proposed border wall. Instead, he signed a stopgap spending measure, setting up a potential fight over the wall in the congressional session between the election and the new Congress.
“Any purely enforcement-oriented solution will only move the needle in the short term,” said Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney who served as an aide to Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “Over the long-term, in order to solve that, he has to either be realistic about a bi­partisan solution and work with Congress — or continue to demagogue it as a political issue, but that’s not going to solve it.”"

President Donald Trump said he’d mobilize the U.S. military to close the border with Mexico to stop an “assault” on the nation by a caravan of migrants from Central America.
Trump, who ran in 2016 promising to tighten U.S. immigration laws and stanch the inflow of undocumented migrants, has called for cutting off foreign aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador if they don’t stop the migrants.

“In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!” Trump said on Twitter.
Hours later, Lieutenant Colonel Jamie Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that “the Department of Defense has not been tasked to provide additional support” beyond National Guard troops already providing assistance.
Trump also attempted to politicize the issue Thursday by claiming -- without providing evidence -- that Democrats are backing the human movement to bolster what he said was the party’s preference for “open borders and existing weak laws.”

Democrats in Congress generally have supported a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants -- but only those who meet certain criteria -- and have never proposed doing away with border rules. Democrats in 2013 led the charge to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws, an effort that stalled because of opposition from Republicans who controlled the House.
The issue has gained new urgency under Trump, whose “zero-tolerance” policy of enforcing border laws came under fire earlier this year after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a plan that included separating migrant families. Though the administration abandoned that policy, Trump has said he’s considering bringing it back as a deterrent.
Currently more than 2,000 people -- including many who left home so quickly they brought only backpacks -- are making their way from Honduras, traveling through Guatemala and heading toward the U.S., The Associated Press reports.
In April, Trump authorized the National Guard to protect the border as a similar group of migrants headed up from Central America. He later credited authorities in Mexico for breaking up that assembly.
The Defense Department has in the past helped the Department of Homeland Security with border security. And former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both deployed National Guard troops to the border during their administrations to bolster security. But American law may also restrict how much the military can do to carry out Trump’s wishes: The 19th-century Posse Comitatus Act is viewed as prohibiting the use of the military to execute domestic laws, according to a 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service.
In other Twitter posts, Trump claimed -- without substantiation -- that many in the caravan are criminals.

5719,Migrant Children Moved Under Cover of Darkness to a Texas Tent City',New York Times (Online News),10/1/2018,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/us/migrant-children-tent-city-texas.html,"But the mass transfers are raising alarm among immigrant advocates, who were already concerned about the lengthy periods of time migrant children are spending in federal custody.
The roughly 100 shelters that have, until now, been the main location for housing detained migrant children are licensed and monitored by state child welfare authorities, who impose requirements on safety and education as well as staff hiring and training.
The tent city in Tornillo, on the other hand, is unregulated, except for guidelines created by the Department of Health and Human Services. For example, schooling is not required there, as it is in regular migrant children shelters.
Mark Greenberg, who oversaw the care of migrant children under President Barack Obama, helped to craft the emergency shelter guidelines. He said the agency tried “to the greatest extent possible” to ensure that conditions in facilities like the one at Tornillo would mirror those in regular shelters, “but there are some ways in which that’s difficult or impossible to do.”
Several shelter workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being fired, described what they said has become standard practice for moving the children: In order to avoid escape attempts, the moves are carried out late at night because children will be less likely to try to run away. For the same reason, children are generally given little advance warning that they will be moved.
At one shelter in the Midwest whose occupants were among those recently transferred to Tornillo, about two dozen children were given just a few hours’ notice last week before they were loaded onto buses — any longer than that, according to one of the shelter workers, and the children may have panicked or tried to flee.
The children wore belts etched in pen with phone numbers for their emergency contacts. One young boy asked the shelter worker if he would be taken care of in Texas. The shelter worker replied that he would, and told him that by moving, he was making space for other children like him who were stuck at the border and needed a place to live."
2851,Hundreds of migrant children moved to Texas tent camp',Washington Examiner,10/1/2018,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hundreds-of-migrant-children-moved-to-texas-tent-camp,"Hundreds of migrant children detained all across the country are reportedly being sent to a tent camp in Tornillo, Texas, along the U.S.-Mexico border.
The minors were moved late at night to deter them from attempting escapes, according to anonymous shelter workers who spoke with the New York Times. In at least one instance, the children were given only hours of advance notice of the move.
The anonymous same shelter workers said the moves would open up shelters for children still waiting at the border.
The Tornillo camp, located 35 miles southeast of El Paso, opened in June for an initial time period of 30 days with an initial capacity of 400 kids. But its timescale and capacity have since been augmented. The camp can now hold thousands of children and will be open at least through the end of the year.
At the camp, the 20 children are placed in each tent, legal services are scarce, and the only education they are offered is workbooks.
Evelyn Stauffer, a spokeswoman for the Health and Human Services Department, defended the use of this sort of ""temporary"" facility to deal especially with the older kids who are more likely to be released soon via sponsorships.
But the report also mentions that immigrant advocates argue that the children could be stuck there for months.
Tornillo is in Texas' 23rd Congressional District, where Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones is hoping to defeat incumbent Republican Rep. Will Hurd in November. FiveThirtyEight's projections have both candidates in a dead heat with near equal chances to win.
The Homeland Security stopped the ""zero-tolerance"" policy, which contributed problem of finding shelter for young migrants, this summer. It had mandated the separation of children from their families after they were apprehended trying to enter the United States between ports of entry."

The children were reportedly placed on buses in the middle of the night to move from shelters in locations ranging from New York to Kansas to the facility in Tornillo, Texas.

The children are now housed in groups of 20, sleeping in lines of bunk beds and receiving no schooling and minimal access to legal services, the newspaper reported, adding that in private shelters and foster homes, the children slept two or three to a room, received formal schooling and had regular visits with legal representatives.

The newspaper previously reported that the number of migrant children in federal custody has increased from 2,400 in May 2017 to a record 12,800 this month.
The facility in Tornillo reportedly opened in June with a 450-bed capacity and was scheduled to stay open for just 30 days. But it is now expected to stay open until at least the end of the year and now accommodates 3,800 beds.
“It is common to use influx shelters as done on military bases in the past, and the intent is to use these temporary facilities only as long as needed,” Evelyn Stauffer, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), told the Times.
Stauffer added that the mass influx of migrant children is the result of a ""broken immigration system."""

The revelation echoes an admission in April by the Department of Health and Human Services that the government had similarly lost track of an additional 1,475 migrant children it had moved out of shelters last year.
In findings that lawmakers described as troubling, Senate investigators said the department could not determine with certainty the whereabouts of 1,488 out of 11,254 children the agency had placed with sponsors in 2018, based on follow-up calls from April 1 to June 30.
The inability to track the whereabouts of migrant children after they have been released to sponsors has raised concerns that they could end up with human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives."

The development follows an admission in April by federal officials that they did not know the whereabouts of 1,475 immigrant children, according to The New York Times.
As in that instance, the Department of Health and Human Services had moved the children out of federal shelters and placed them with sponsors, but since then officials remain uncertain where the latest 1,488 kids are located.
Immigrant children are led by staff in single file between tents at a detention facility next to the Mexican border in Tornillo, Texas in June 2018
The missing children account for about 13 percent of the 11,254 children that DHS has placed with sponsors so far in 2018.
DHS has a method of calling sponsors who have taken the children 30 days after placement, and those calls have been fruitless in the cases of the lost migrant children.
However, department officials have said they are no longer responsible for the minors once they have been placed outside of DHS custody.
'These children are not 'lost,""' DHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley told The Times. 'Their sponsors — who are usually parents or family members and in all cases have been vetted for criminality and ability to provide for them — simply did not respond or could not be reached when this voluntary call was made.'
The new developments came as Republican and Democrat lawmakers proposed new legislation on Tuesday that would create clear parameters defining DHS's responsibility to the immigrant children, before and after being placed with a sponsor.
The draft bill would require DHS to conduct background checks on sponsors before placing children with them, and mandate that the agency would have to ensure sponsors appropriately care for the children and appear at hearings in immigration court.
The legislation would also mandate that DHS notifies the states where migrant children are placed in advance, and further increase the number of immigration judges to offset a massive backlog of nearly 750,000 cases.

'This bill will ensure that we keep track of unaccompanied minors in our country, which will both help protect them from trafficking and abuse as well as help ensure they appear for their immigration court proceedings,' said Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio and the bill's co-sponsor. 'These efforts are critical for safeguarding these children and upholding our immigration system. This isn't a partisan issue.'
Fellow co-sponsor Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut echoed Portman's sentiments.
'Children who risk their lives to make a dangerous journey in pursuit of asylum shouldn't then have to worry about falling victim to human trafficking or being handed over to abusive or neglectful adults in the United States,' Blumenthal said.
DHS has placed more than 135,000 unaccompanied migrant children with sponsors in the U.S. since October 2014."

The nearly 1,500 children that HHS cannot account for is among the 11,254 migrant children the agency had placed with sponsors this year, according to the Times.
The figures are based on follow-up calls to sponsors between April 1 and June 30, the newspaper noted, adding that the lack of knowledge about the whereabouts of about 1,500 children gives rise to fear that they could end up in the hands of human traffickers.
""As communicated to members of Congress multiple times, these children are not ‘lost,'"" Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for HHS, said in a statement to the Times.
""Their sponsors — who are usually parents or family members and in all cases have been vetted for criminality and ability to provide for them — simply did not respond or could not be reached when this voluntary call was made.”
The findings regarding the amount of children HHS can't account for comes after the department said in April that it could not account for 1,475 immigrant children that had been transferred out of federal shelters earlier this year.
The discovery was released as GOP and Democratic senators introduced legislation intended to improve the safety of migrant children, even when they are not under HHS custody.
Among other provisions, the legislation senators introduced would order HHS to run background checks before placing a child with a sponsor.

4070,$10M redirected from FEMA funds to ICE less than a year after Hurricane Maria',Washington Examiner,9/12/2018,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/budgets-deficits/10m-redirected-from-fema-funds-to-ice-less-than-a-year-after-hurricane-maria,"Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., shared documents Tuesday that purported to show millions of dollars being redirected from FEMA’s budget to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to pay for immigration detention.
The Department of Homeland Security’s “Transfer and Reprogramming Notifications” seemed to order the redirection of money from FEMA to ICE less than a year after Hurricane Maria hit the U.S. last year, and right before the 2018 hurricane season, according to MSNBC.
Merkley told MSNBC Tuesday that the documents showing the $9,755,303 transfer are authentic and the transfer happened this summer.
A DHS spokesperson confirmed the transfer, but said none of the money being transferred to ICE came from disaster response and recovery efforts.
“Under no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from FEMA to immigration enforcement efforts,” DHS spokesperson Tyler Houlton posted to Twitter Tuesday. “This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster.”
Houlton continued that the money could not have been used for hurricane response due to limitations.

“It means that just as hurricane season is starting, because it generally starts June 1, the administration is working hard to find funds for additional detention camps, and of course this is all part of the child separation policy,” Merkley said.
The Democratic senator, who has worked against President Trump’s zero tolerance illegal immigration policy, says the nearly $10 million going toward ICE would help to build internment camps for children separated from their families when crossing the border illegally."

Jeff Merkley (D-Ore).
The lawmaker first shared the documents with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, saying that the Department of Homeland Security requested the money “just as hurricane season [was] starting” and as it was attempting to fund Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the midst of its new “zero tolerance” immigration policy. The controversial crackdown resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents, hundreds of whom have yet to be reunited.
“This is a scandal. At the start of hurricane season — when American citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are still suffering from FEMA’s inadequate recovery efforts — the administration transferred millions of dollars away from FEMA,” Merkley said in a statement to HuffPost. “And for what? To implement their profoundly misguided ‘zero tolerance’ policy. It wasn’t enough to rip thousands of children out of the arms of their parents — the administration chose to partly pay for this horrific program by taking away from the ability to respond to damage from this year’s upcoming and potentially devastating hurricane season.”

The document’s release comes just days before Hurricane Florence, a powerful Category 4 storm, is expected to make landfall in the Carolinas. Millions of people are currently evacuating or hunkering down.
“$10 million comes out of FEMA when we’re facing a hurricane season knowing what’s happened last year,” Merkley told Maddow on Tuesday. “And look what we’ve had since, a hurricane just barely miss Hawaii. ... Now we have this hurricane, Florence, bearing down on the Carolinas.”
DHS spokesman Tyler Houlton late Tuesday called the senator’s appearance a “sorry attempt to push a false agenda,” saying the administration was instead “focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster.”

This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster. — Tyler Q. Houlton (@SpoxDHS) September 12, 2018
The document released by Merkley, which was supplied to HuffPost, states that more than $2.3 million from a total of about $9.8 million had been diverted from FEMA’s “response and recovery” budget. Other funding was transferred from regional operations, mitigation efforts, preparedness and protection, and mission support budgets.
The amount transferred is less than 1 percent of FEMA’s budget for the fiscal year, according to the document, which also notes that the agency’s “mission impact” would be minimized as FEMA would only be required to “curtail training, travel, public engagement sessions, IT security support and infrastructure maintenance, and IT investments.”
The Department of Homeland Security has the authority to move a limited amount of money around within its budget. In the past, Congress had limited DHS from shuffling more than $5 million from one approved program to another through the process known as “reprogramming.”
A coalition of human rights groups penned a letter on June 27 asking the Senate Committee on Appropriations to oppose attempts by DHS to up the amount of funding for immigrant detention, accusing the department of “dramatically overspending its appropriated budget in ways both morally reprehensible and fiscally irresponsible.”
The $10 million of additional funds that DHS aims to use to expand immigrant detention amounts to less than 1 percent of the ICE budget for locking up immigrants, which tops $1.4 billion."
3943,"Trump administration took nearly $10 million from FEMA's budget to support ICE, documents show""",USA TODAY,9/12/2018,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/09/11/femas-budget-cut-10-million-support-ice-documents-show/1274723002/,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration took nearly $10 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency's budget this summer to help boost U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to budget documents shared with USA TODAY.
The revelation, just ahead of Hurricane Florence's expected landfall in North and South Carolina, was found by Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., who first shared the documents live on MSNBC late Tuesday.
He told USA TODAY that after the devastation of last year's storms, including hurricanes Maria, Harvey and Irma, FEMA should have the funds it needs to be prepared for another disastrous hurricane season.
""It's almost guaranteed to happen again, so this is just incredibly irresponsible,"" Merkley said.
The budgeting document, titled ""Department of Homeland Security FY 2018 transfer and reprogramming notifications,"" lists $9,755,303 taken from FEMA's budget, about .9 percent of the agency's listed overall budget, and given to support ICE.
Money was also taken from other agencies, including millions from theTransportation Security Administration and the U.S. Coast Guard, to help ICE, the document states.
The document lists the additional money was taken to help ICE detain immigrants along the southern border, fund beds in detention centers and remove undocumented immigrants from the country.
""ICE must have sufficient detention bed capacity to detain illegal aliens when necessary as it enforces the Nation's immigration laws as fairly and effectively as possible,"" the budget document states. ""Ensuring adequate funding for the detention beds requires projecting an Average Daily Population (ADP) for adult detainees as well as the daily costs incurred in keeping a detainee in custody.""
The nearly $10 million was taken from various places within FEMA, including training, preparedness and protection, and response and recovery operations.
Tylet Houlton, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees both agencies, dismissed criticism of the document as a ""sorry attempt to push a false agenda"" and said none of the money transferred came from disaster relief funding.
""Under no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from @fema to immigration enforcement efforts. This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster,"" he said in a tweet. ""The money in question — transferred to ICE from FEMA’s routine operating expenses — could not have been used for hurricane response due to appropriation limitations.""
More: Trump calls Puerto Rico response an 'unsung success'
While it's not uncommon for agencies to move money around, FEMA's budget was decimated last year due to the barrage of storms and fires that affected the nation and the agency was criticized heavily for its handling of the disaster in Puerto Rico.
Merkely said he was made aware of FEMA's budget cuts while looking into a solution for family separation and the detention centers set up along the border. He said the document makes it clear ICE is using money from FEMA ""to build more detention centers.""
Merkely said he believes the budgeting reallocation happened in response to the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy, which was rolled out earlier this year.
The policy led to thousands of families being separated and housed in detention centers, which he says may have increased the need for more money in ICE's budget.
Both FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests from USA TODAY."
6152,"Trump Is Using Mollie Tibbetts For His Anti-Immigrant Agenda, And It\xe2\x80\x99s Reprehensible'",HuffPost,8/23/2018,,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-mollie-tibbetts-trump_us_5b7ed217e4b072951510d3cb,"Leah Millis/Reuters The killing of University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts has instantly become a red-hot wedge that President Donald Trump and his supporters are wielding to their political advantage.
Last month, I joined about 15,000 other cyclists in a weeklong bike ride across Iowa. We rode past cornfields and through small towns, which welcomed us with pork barbecue, slices of pie and all the trappings of a rolling state fair.
Every so often, alongside the lemonade stands or in people’s yards, I spotted posters. They featured the smiling face of a young woman named Mollie Tibbetts. She was missing, the posters said. Please call with information.
Tibbetts, a 20-year-old University of Iowa student, went out for a run on July 18 in her hometown of Brooklyn, Iowa, and never returned. A massive search was on. Her family held out hope she’d been kidnapped and would be found alive.
Iowa law enforcement officials announced the worst on Tuesday morning. A woman’s body, believed to be that of Tibbetts, had been found buried beneath corn stalks in a field near the town where she’d grown up. A 24-year-old man named Cristhian Bahena Rivera led police to the site. He’s been charged with Tibbetts’ murder.
Rivera is a native of Mexico who is believed to have been living in the area for four to seven years. He worked at a dairy farm. And he is in the United States without papers.
And with that last detail, Tibbetts’ death has instantly become a red-hot wedge that President Donald Trump and his supporters are wielding to their political advantage this midterm election cycle (and will surely continue to use long after the race).
The seal-the-border crowd has drawn Tibbetts into its fold and is using her name and her tragic death to benefit its cause.
By Tuesday evening, the killing of the college student, allegedly at the hands of an undocumented immigrant, was the biggest story on FOX News. Never mind the blockbuster courtroom developments that same day that resulted in Trump’s personal lawyer and his former campaign chairman being convicted of multiple felony crimes.
Iowa’s Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, quickly weighed in with a statement of her own. “We are angry that a broken immigration system allowed a predator like this to live in our community,” Reynolds said, as though her state’s economy doesn’t rely on immigrants ― legal or otherwise ― to prop up its agricultural and manufacturing sectors.
Trump himself tossed the bone to a crowd of supporters at a rally in West Virginia on Tuesday night. “You heard about today, with the illegal alien coming in from, very sadly, from Mexico,” he said. “And you saw what happened to that incredible, beautiful young woman.”
A rational response would be, “What’s your point?” As the president and his administration remind us constantly, thousands of undocumented immigrants enter the United States every year. But what this administration repeatedly fails to mention is that multiple studies have shown they are much less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. The number who commit serious violent crimes is smaller yet.
But Trump is not a rational leader, and these are not rational times. The noxious group known as FAIR, or the Federation for American Immigration Reform, keeps a running list of “serious crimes by illegal aliens.” Trump in June attempted to deflect attention from his administration’s policy of separating parents and children at the border by inviting family members of Americans who’d been killed by undocumented immigrants to the White House.
Suddenly, every immigrant who has entered the United States without papers is a potential menace. They are not human beings with joys, sorrows and stories; they are felons in the making.
And now, just as special counsel Robert Mueller’s vise of an investigation tightens, and pundits warn of Democratic gains in November, current events have served up Mollie Tibbetts and Cristhian Bahena Rivera. The beautiful, quintessentially wholesome Iowa girl allegedly murdered by the illegal alien from Mexico. (Who, by the way, worked on a dairy farm owned by the family of a prominent Iowa Republican.)
Suddenly, every immigrant who has entered the United States without papers is a potential menace. They are not human beings with joys, sorrows and stories; they are felons in the making. Round them up. Build the wall. There is nothing Trump would rather talk about.
In her death, Mollie Tibbetts is quickly becoming an unwitting tool of the haters. It doesn’t matter what she thought about undocumented immigrants or immigrants in general. It doesn’t matter that members of her extended family have asked that her killing not be politicized. The seal-the-border crowd has drawn Tibbetts into its fold and is using her name and her tragic death to benefit its cause. They will distill her memory into that of the young woman in Iowa murdered by the undocumented immigrant, when in fact she was so much more than that.
Hours after police found her body, former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Axios that “if Molly Tibbetts is a household name by October, Democrats will be in deep trouble.”
That’s the plan, and it’s reprehensible. Fair-minded Americans must push back against this cynical ploy to use a family’s tragedy to rip a new seam in an already divided nation.

5997,After Mollie Tibbetts tragic death \xe2\x80\x93 we owe it to her to fix our broken immigration system',Fox News (Online),8/23/2018,,,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/08/23/after-mollie-tibbetts-tragic-death-owe-it-to-her-to-fix-our-broken-immigration-system.html,"The tragic killing of 20-year-old University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts – allegedly by an illegal immigrant from Mexico – appears to be yet another example of America’s dangerous and failed immigration policy.
Authorities in Iowa charged a man identified as Cristhian Rivera with first-degree murder Tuesday in Tibbetts’ death. He is being held in jail on a $5 million cash-only bond.
According to authorities, Rivera – if that is really his name – is a 24-year old illegal immigrant from Mexico, whose movements driving a black SUV in the area of Tibbetts’ disappearance were caught on security cameras. Tibbets disappeared July 18 while she was running in the rural central Iowa town of Brooklyn.
How many more needless deaths will it take for our immigration policies to change?
Apologists for illegal immigration are already trying to deflect public attention from this horrific case.
When asked about Tibbetts’ killing on CNN, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. – beloved by far-left Democrats and a possible presidential contender in 2020 – said that she knows this is hard for the Tibbetts family. However, she said that our focus should be “on where the real problems are,” which she said is the separation of “mamas and babies” who entered the U.S. illegally at the border.
Fordham University Professor Christina Greer lamented on MSNBC that “Fox News is talking about a girl in Iowa” instead of devoting more air time to court proceedings Tuesday resulting in felony convictions for former Trump presidential campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a guilty plea to other crimes by President Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen. Greer later backtracked for what she called her “flippant” remark about Tibbetts.
Americans should not be distracted by the chirping of these and other advocates of open borders, including the Cato Institute, which claims misleadingly that illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes than Americans. Even if that statement was factual (it isn’t), it is completely irrelevant to this case, and no comfort to the victims.
The reality is that while most illegal immigrants are not violent, many do commit crimes, sometimes horrific ones, just like Americans do.
The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office estimates in a new report that since 1974 there have been more than 32,000 immigrants incarcerated for homicide in federal and state prisons. Other government reports show that most of these criminal immigrants are in the country illegally. They are not usually legal immigrants, who are vetted for criminal records.
It sounds obvious, but nowadays it is necessary to remind lawmakers that these homicides and many other crimes could have been prevented with better border security to block illegal entry into the U.S.
The fact that illegal immigration exacerbates crime is not lost on America’s local law enforcement agencies. Sheriffs and police leaders have become more and more outspoken in recent years urging the federal government – and especially Congress – to shore up our immigration enforcement.
Hundreds of sheriffs signed a letter to Congress in the spring, asking for the passage of a House bill to improve enforcement. The letter states: “Year after year, we have been warning the Federal government about detrimental increases in transnational drug trafficking, gang violence, sex trafficking, murder, and other escalating incidents of crime by illegal aliens entering our country.”
Not only are criminal immigrants a threat to the community, they are a strain on taxpayers. The same GAO report found that federal and state governments spent about $2.5 billion on incarcerating foreign criminals in 2015 – not including the additional cost of arrest, prosecution, deportation, and of course, the cost to the victims. Now we see how high the cost can be to Iowans for some of the low-wage workers demanded by local farmers.
The killing of Mollie Tibbetts also highlights the role of identity fraud in facilitating the illegal employment that draws most illegal immigrants to this country.
Rivera reportedly used a false identity to secure an Iowa photo ID card and may have used these documents to secure employment at a farm, where he apparently worked for four years. It has not been revealed if he used these same documents to get a driver’s license.
Authorities said the Chevy Malibu that Rivera used to stalk Tibbetts and then transport her body to the corn field where she was later found was not registered in his name. That’s a common practice for unlicensed drivers, and another in the list of crimes of “otherwise law-abiding” illegal immigrants.
An estimated 75 percent of illegal immigrants obtain false documents. Counterfeit green cards are not difficult to detect, but incidents of total identity theft – in which the illegal immigrant uses the name, date of birth, and Social Security number of a real person – have become more common.
The Trump administration is cracking down on this practice. Last month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions traveled to Boston to announce the results of Operation Double Trouble. Under the enforcement operation, dozens of illegal immigrants were charged with identity theft-related crimes, including fraudulently obtaining Medicaid and other welfare benefits, and registering to vote.
Some of those charged are heroin traffickers, who have obtained U.S. passports to facilitate their deadly illicit commerce.
More can be done, even without passing new laws.
The Social Security Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, and immigration agencies must be empowered to work together to act on instances of the multiple use of Social Security numbers that are easily detectable within government tax and crime databases.
Citizens should be notified when their Social Security numbers have been compromised. Employers should have to terminate illegal workers when detected. Agencies should use facial recognition technology more frequently to detect imposters.
As long as prospective illegal immigrants believe that after making it past border and visa controls they will be able to get a job, a driver’s license, and live as if they were in the U.S. legally, they will continue to come.
Like the smuggling rings, the identity document industry is part of the infrastructure of illegal immigration. And like the smugglers, the document vendors do not care whether their clients are harmless workers, drug traffickers, terrorists or criminals.
When authorities allow such illicit enterprises to flourish, they are inviting more illegal immigration, and setting the stage for more atrocities committed by people who should not have found it so easy to get here and stay here illegally."
3168,"Iowa student's murder thrust into U.S. debate over immigration""",Reuters,8/23/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iowa-crime/iowa-students-murder-thrust-into-us-debate-over-immigration-idUSKCN1L72BU,"(Reuters) - The arrest of a man who U.S. authorities have said is an illegal immigrant on charges of murdering an Iowa college student has thrust the case into the debate on immigration policy, with President Donald Trump blaming Mollie Tibbetts’ death on weak laws.
Christhian Rivera, 24, was arrested and charged on Monday with the murder of 20-year-old Tibbetts, who disappeared in July while out jogging. A woman’s body has been found but has not yet been positively identified, authorities have said.
Law enforcement officials told reporters on Monday that Rivera was Mexican and in the country illegally. However, his defense lawyer said in a court filing on Wednesday that Rivera had legal status.
Trump, who has taken a tough stance on immigration and referred to some Mexican migrants as criminals and rapists in his 2016 election campaign, made a reference to the Tibbetts case at a rally in West Virginia on Tuesday.
“Should never have happened,” said Trump. “The immigration laws are such a disgrace.”
The political fallout from the killing could reverberate across Iowa, a swing state that has a hotly contested gubernatorial race and where Democrats see a chance at taking two of the 23 seats they need to win back from Republicans in November’s midterms to gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
Iowa Republican Governor Kim Reynolds echoed Trump’s approach, blaming Tibbetts’ death on the nation’s immigration laws.
“We are angry that a broken immigration system allowed a predator like this to live in our community, and we will do all we can bring justice to Mollie’s killer,” she said in a Tuesday statement.

But Republican members of Congress and congressional candidates in closely competitive Iowa districts were more guarded, perhaps wary of voter backlash if they politicized the case.
Republican lawmakers Rod Blum and David Young each issued statements expressing sympathy for the Tibbetts’ family but avoided any mention of illegal immigration.
Christopher Peters, a Republican mounting a long-shot challenge to Iowa Democratic Congressman Dave Loebsack, said on Facebook that politicizing Tibbetts’ murder “cheapens the death of this young woman.”
“Yes, our immigration system is broken, and Congress has failed to fix it,” Peters wrote. “There is much we can and must do. For now, though, we should mourn the loss of Mollie.”
Tibbetts’ father, who made many public pleas for information about his daughter’s whereabouts, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. A man who picked up the phone at the home of Tibbetts’ mother in Iowa declined to comment.
During his 2016 campaign, Trump spoke almost daily about the 2015 death of Kate Steinle, who was struck by a bullet that ricocheted off the ground after being accidentally fired by an illegal immigrant. A jury last year cleared the immigrant of murder and manslaughter charges, and Trump railed against the decision.
Iowa voters might recoil at Tibbetts’ death being politicized so quickly, said Timothy Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa.
“Kate Steinle was used nationally by Republicans as an example of a system that needs fixing,” Hagle said. “That might happen again, but I’m not sure it will be handled the same way in Iowa.”

Several residents of Brooklyn, Iowa, where Tibbetts lived, expressed sadness at how quickly her death had become a political talking point.
“I wish Trump had not made this political,” said Janice, a 60-year-old waitress at the Classic Deli, who declined to give her last name. “The family just wants to heal. I have a farm with Mexican immigrants, and I never felt afraid.”"
3483,"Trump implores state, local officials to publicly praise ICE'",New York Post,8/20/2018,,,https://nypost.com/2018/08/20/trump-implores-state-local-officials-to-publicly-praise-ice/,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has asked state and local officials to publicly praise Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, calling efforts to abolish the agency “dangerous.”
In a letter issued Monday, Trump asked public officials to applaud the “sacrifice” of ICE officers as well as Customs and Border Protection agents.
“Through letters, public statements, op-eds, resolutions, and events, we can give our voice to our Nation’s longstanding tradition of honoring the public servants who protect our communities and our way of life,” Trump wrote.
He said he wrote the letter because ICE has become a political punching bag, with a number of likely Democratic 2020 hopefuls — including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) — urging that the agency be abolished.
“Tragically, the brave men and women of ICE have recently been subjected to a nationwide campaign of smears, insults, and attacks by politicians shamelessly catering to the extreme elements of our society that desire lawlessness and anarchy,” Trump said in the letter.
“These horrendous assaults are no-doubt spurred on by the dangerous ‘Abolish ICE’ movement – a movement to abolish our borders entirely,” the president said.
Trump referenced protests against ICE in Portland, Oregon — in which the protesters had the backing of the city’s mayor — and in Louisville, Kentucky.
“Yet, while anarchist protesters hurl vicious insults at ICE officers in Portland and other disturbing episodes nationwide, those same ICE officers continue to dutifully remove some of the most dangerous and violent individuals from the communities they protect – putting their lives on the line in the process,” Trump said.
The president said that in fiscal year 2017, ICE arrested more than 125,000 “aliens” with criminal records. He also pointed out how immigration enforcement plays a part in keeping the US safe post-9/11.
“We also must not forget the important role that ICE and CBP play in preventing terrorism,” the president said. “The attacks were carried out by foreign nationals who exploited our lax immigration laws and defrauded our immigration system in order to murder nearly 3,000 innocent people.”
Trump was hosting an event later in the day, a “Salute to the Heroes of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection,” at the White House.
He’s invited ICE officers, CBP agents and politicians, including Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) and Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, to take part."
2772,"President Trump attacks critics of border agents, warns of 'bloodshed and suffering'""",USA TODAY,8/20/2018,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/20/trump-backs-ice-open-letter-calls-local-cooperation/1042715002/,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump called on local officials to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in an open letter Monday, warning that “terror, bloodshed and suffering” would continue without their cooperation.
Trump’s letter, which was released by the White House hours before he was scheduled to hold an event to “salute” immigration officials, criticized the “abolish ICE” movement supported by some Democrats on Capitol Hill.
“Tragically, the brave men and woman of ICE have recently been subjected to a nationwide campaign of smears, insults and attacks by politicians shamelessly catering to the extreme elements in our society that desire lawlessness and anarchy,” Trump wrote to state and local leaders.
Though Trump did not mention Democrats directly in the letter, the language mirrors rhetoric the president has often embraced during campaign rallies. He regularly accuses Democratic candidates at those events of supporting “open borders.”
Returning to an issue that was central to his 2016 campaign, Trump has been working to bring immigration to the fore again in this year’s midterms, hitting Democrats who have supported abolishing the agency.
ICE came under new scrutiny this year following the president's ""zero tolerance"" policy, which led to high profile family separations at the border.
A group of House Democrats introduced legislation last month to abolish ICE within one year, although the legislation has little to no chance of becoming law because neither the Republican majority nor many centrist Democrats support the idea.
In the letter, Trump mentioned the protests that took place this summer in Louisville, Kentucky, and Portland, Oregon.
And the president called on local officials to voluntarily comply with federal immigration agencies, even as some cities and counties have decided to restrict the level of information they will provide to ICE.
“The most recent assaults include the repugnant hostility directed toward selfless ICE employees in Portland, Oregon, and the verbal abuse suffered by ICE employees in Louisville, Kentucky,” Trump wrote.

Unabashedly politicizing the federal agency established in 2003, the president aligned himself with rank-and-file Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers he invited to the White House and repeatedly lionized as “brave heroes,” while battering Democrats as “extremists” who want to “abolish America’s borders.”
“They have no courage,” Trump said. “They have no guts. They just have big, loud mouths.”
Trump took special aim at Democrats who have called for abolishing ICE, as some on the party’s left wing have done. The president called it a “grave betrayal of these law enforcement officers and the noble sacrifices they make to uphold our laws, secure our borders and protect our safety.”

Determined to head off a Democratic takeover of the House, Trump gave no quarter in the polarizing battle over immigration, even emphasizing the controversial enforcement crackdown that resulted in more than 2,600 migrant children being taken from their families on the Southwest border this spring and placed in shelters.
That harsh policy led to a national outcry and signs of a political debacle for the White House, forcing Trump to back down in June. U.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw, who had ordered the administration to reunite the families, criticized the government last month for its lack of preparation and coordination. More than 400 parents were deported without their children.
Trump sought to regain the political upper hand Monday with an event in the East Room saluting several dozen officers from ICE, which arrests and deports people in the country illegally, and agents from Customs and Border Protection, which is responsible for guarding the border (although he repeatedly referred to “CBC,” not “CBP,” in his comments).
The president credited them with “liberating towns” from MS-13 gangs but reserved his harshest rhetoric for Democrats, who he accused of “shameful attacks on our great law enforcement.”

“Any politician who puts criminal aliens before American citizens should find a new line of work,” Trump said, drawing applause.
Democrats have used Trump’s immigration crackdown — and the symbolism surrounding an agency that has come under fire for workplace raids and widespread reports of sexual and physical abuse in ICE detention facilities — to build enthusiasm among core supporters and activists.
But establishment Democrats worry that calls to abolish ICE, which has more than 20,000 employees, could backfire in November.
Those concerns grew after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez beat a party leader in a Democratic primary House race in New York, making her an instant celebrity. Since she had campaigned on abolishing ICE, the party’s liberal base has pushed others to embrace it.

Two leading potential presidential contenders — Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York — have joined the cause, a sign that the party is being tugged to the left as it considers how to confront Trump in 2020.
While the movement has some supporters in Congress, many Democrats have stayed away, choosing to focus on ICE’s documented abuses and Trump’s rhetoric and policies rather than taking on a challenge that has low support in polls.
Some who support abolishing ICE concede it may not happen but hope to push the center of the immigration debate further to the left, much as conservatives have pulled their party to the right by staking out extreme positions.
Advocates of eliminating ICE said they do not seek to end enforcement of immigration laws. But they say that ICE has twisted its mission by focusing on deportation of families at the expense of preventing crime and terrorism.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California has tried to split the issue, calling for “fundamentally reforming ICE’s mission,” while stopping short of endorsing an end to the agency.
Customs and Border Protection, not ICE, is tasked with patrolling the border, but many people conflate their roles.
“When you say ‘abolish ICE,’ what the rest of the population gets is that you want to leave the borders unguarded,” said Jose Dante Parra, a Miami-based political consultant who served as the point person for Latino outreach for former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid.
Parra, who works with immigration advocacy groups, supports the goal of overhauling ICE, arguing that it focuses on “mothers dropping off their kids at school who then go to clean somebody’s house,” rather than harder targets like terrorism rings and drug traffickers.

Mary Small, policy director for Detention Watch Network, an immigration advocacy group in Washington, called Trump’s focus on ICE “propaganda that’s really intended to stoke people’s fears” because of the public outcry to his immigration crackdown.
“People are having a visceral reaction to seeing this administration’s enforcement of these policies,” Small said. “The perception of ICE agents has already shifted. So the president holding up these ICE agents as heroes — it’s a response to the fact that our stories are breaking through.”
Trump and many Republicans are eager to talk about abolishing ICE. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin recently said it showed that Democrats had “really jumped the shark on the left.”
More than half of voters — 54% — surveyed in a July poll by Politico/Morning Consult opposed eliminating ICE, while only 25% want to abolish the agency.

“From a political standpoint this is a gift from the Democrats,” said Matt Schlapp, a Trump ally and chairman of the American Conservative Union. “It shows their heart, which is one of radicalism.”
Schlapp, whose wife, Mercedes, works in the White House communications office and moderated a panel at Monday’s event, links Trump’s embrace of ICE and Border Patrol agents to his other law-and-order rhetoric, including his criticism of National Football League players who have protested police brutality during the national anthem and Trump’s embrace of the Blue Lives Matter movement.
During her panel ahead of the president’s remarks, Mercedes Schlapp asked several law enforcement agents and lawmakers to react specifically to calls to “abolish” ICE.
They responded with predictable umbrage, with Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) calling such a proposal “unconscionable” and “unpatriotic.”

Glosser is a retired neuropsychologist: formerly a member of the Neurology faculties of Boston University School of Medicine and Jefferson Medical College.
Let me tell you a story about Stephen Miller and chain migration.
It begins at the turn of the 20th century, in a dirt-floor shack in the village of Antopol, a shtetl of subsistence farmers in what is now Belarus. Beset by violent anti-Jewish pogroms and forced childhood conscription in the Czar’s army, the patriarch of the shack, Wolf-Leib Glosser, fled a village where his forebears had lived for centuries and took his chances in America.

He set foot on Ellis Island on January 7, 1903, with $8 to his name. Though fluent in Polish, Russian and Yiddish, he understood no English. An elder son, Nathan, soon followed. By street corner peddling and sweatshop toil, Wolf-Leib and Nathan sent enough money home to pay off debts and buy the immediate family’s passage to America in 1906. That group included young Sam Glosser, who with his family settled in the western Pennsylvania city of Johnstown, a booming coal and steel town that was a magnet for other hardworking immigrants. The Glosser family quickly progressed from selling goods from a horse and wagon to owning a haberdashery in Johnstown run by Nathan and Wolf-Leib to a chain of supermarkets and discount department stores run by my grandfather, Sam, and the next generation of Glossers, including my dad, Izzy. It was big enough to be listed on the AMEX stock exchange and employed thousands of people over time. In the span of some 80 years and five decades, this family emerged from poverty in a hostile country to become a prosperous, educated clan of merchants, scholars, professionals, and, most important, American citizens.
What does this classically American tale have to do with Stephen Miller? Well, Izzy Glosser is his maternal grandfather, and Stephen’s mother, Miriam, is my sister.
I have watched with dismay and increasing horror as my nephew, an educated man who is well aware of his heritage, has become the architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our family’s life in this country.
I shudder at the thought of what would have become of the Glossers had the same policies Stephen so coolly espouses— the travel ban, the radical decrease in refugees, the separation of children from their parents, and even talk of limiting citizenship for legal immigrants — been in effect when Wolf-Leib made his desperate bid for freedom. The Glossers came to the U.S. just a few years before the fear and prejudice of the “America first” nativists of the day closed U.S. borders to Jewish refugees. Had Wolf-Leib waited, his family likely would have been murdered by the Nazis along with all but seven of the 2,000 Jews who remained in Antopol. I would encourage Stephen to ask himself if the chanting, torch-bearing Nazis of Charlottesville, whose support his boss seems to court so cavalierly, do not envision a similar fate for him.

Like other immigrants, our family’s welcome to the USA was not always a warm one, but we largely had the protection of the law, there was no state-sponsored violence against us, no kidnapping of our male children, and we enjoyed good relations with our neighbors. True, Jews were excluded from many occupations, couldn’t buy homes in some towns, couldn’t join certain organizations or attend certain schools or universities, but life was good. As in past generations, there were hate mongers who regarded the most recent groups of poor immigrants as scum, rapists, gangsters, drunks and terrorists, but largely the Glosser family was left alone to live our lives and build the American dream. Children were born, synagogues founded, and we thrived. This was the miracle of America.
Acting for so long in the theater of right-wing politics, Stephen and Trump may have become numb to the resultant human tragedy and blind to the hypocrisy of their policy decisions. After all, Stephen’s is not the only family with a chain immigration story in the Trump administration. Trump's grandfather is reported to have been a German migrant on the run from military conscription to a new life in the United States, and his mother fled the poverty of rural Scotland for the economic possibilities of New York City. (Trump’s in-laws just became citizens on the strength of his wife’s own citizenship.)
These facts are important not only for their grim historical irony but because vulnerable people are being hurt. They are real people, not the ghoulish caricatures portrayed by Trump. When confronted by the deaths and suffering of thousands, our senses are overwhelmed, and the victims become statistics rather than people. I meet these statistics one at a time through my volunteer service as a neuropsychologist for the Philadelphia affiliate of HIAS (formerly the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), the global nonprofit that protects refugees and helped my family more than 100 years ago. I will share the story of one such man I have met in the hopes that my nephew might recognize elements of our shared heritage.
In the early 2000s, Joseph (not his real name) was conscripted at the age of 14 to be a soldier in Eritrea and sent to a remote desert military camp. Officers there discovered a Bible under his pillow which aroused their suspicion that he might belong to a foreign evangelical sect that would claim his loyalty and sap his will to fight. Joseph was actually a member of the state-approved Coptic church but was nonetheless immediately subjected to torture. “They smashed my face into the ground, tied my hands and feet together behind my back, stomped on me, and hung me from a tree by my bonds while they beat me with batons for the others to see.”
Joseph was tortured for 20 consecutive days before being taken to a military prison and crammed into a dark unventilated cell with 36 other men, little food and no proper hygiene. Some died, and in time Joseph was stricken with dysentery. When he was too weak to stand, he was taken to a civilian clinic where he was fed by the medical staff. Upon regaining his strength, he escaped to a nearby road where a sympathetic driver took him north through the night to a camp in Sudan where he joined other refugees. Joseph was on the first leg of a journey that would cover thousands of miles and almost 10 years.
Before Donald Trump had started his political ascent promulgating the false story that Barack Obama was a foreign-born Muslim, while my nephew, Stephen, was famously recovering from the hardships of his high school cafeteria in Santa Monica, Joseph was a child on his own in Sudan in fear of being deported back to Eritrea to face execution for desertion. He worked any job he could get, saved his money and made his way through Sudan. He endured arrest and extortion in Libya. He returned to Sudan, then kept moving to Dubai, Brazil and eventually to a southern border crossing into Texas, where he sought asylum. In all of the countries he traveled through during his ordeal, he was vulnerable, exploited and his status was “illegal.” But in the United States, he had a chance to acquire the protection of a documented immigrant.
Today, at 30, Joseph lives in Pennsylvania and has a wife and child. He is a smart, warm, humble man of great character who is grateful for every day of his freedom and safety. He bears emotional scars from not seeing his parents or siblings since he was 14. He still trembles, cries and struggles for breath when describing his torture, and he bears physical scars as well. He hopes to become a citizen, return to work and make his contribution to America. His story, though unique in its particulars, is by no means unusual. I have met Central Americans fleeing corrupt governments, violence and criminal extortion; a Yemeni woman unable to return to her war-ravaged home country and fearing sexual mutilation if she goes back to her Saudi husband; and an escaped kidnap-bride from central Asia.
Trump wants to make us believe that these desperate migrants are an existential threat to the United States; the most powerful nation in world history and a nation made strong by immigrants. Trump and my nephew both know their immigrant and refugee roots. Yet, they repeat the insults and false accusations of earlier generations against these refugees to make them seem less than human. Trump publicly parades the grieving families of people hurt or killed by migrants, just as the early Nazis dredged up Jewish criminals to frighten and enrage their political base to justify persecution of all Jews. Almost every American family has an immigration story of its own based on flight from war, poverty, famine, persecution, fear or hopelessness. Most of these immigrants became workers, entrepreneurs, scientists and soldiers of America.
Most damning is the administration's evident intent to make policy that specifically disadvantages people based on their ethnicity, country of origin and religion. No matter what opinion is held about immigration, any government that specifically enacts law or policy on that basis must be recognized as a threat to all of us. Laws bereft of justice are the gateway to tyranny. Today others may be the target, but tomorrow it might just as easily be you or me. History will be the judge, but in the meantime the normalization of these policies is rapidly eroding the collective conscience of America. Immigration reform is a complex issue that will require compassion and wisdom to bring the nation to a just solution, but the politicians who have based their political and professional identity on ethnic demonization and exclusion cannot be trusted to do so. As free Americans, and descendants of immigrants and refugees, we have the obligation to exercise our conscience by voting for candidates who will stand up for our highest national values and not succumb to our lowest fears."

“If my nephew’s ideas on immigration had been in force a century ago, our family would have been wiped out,” David S. Glosser wrote of his nephew’s attitudes toward immigration in an editorial published by Politico on Monday.
Glosser proceeded to tell a story of a man, Wolf-Leib Glosser, who fled the village of Antopol, now known as Belarus, to come to America.

Glosser said the man arrived in Ellis Island on January 7, 1903, with just $8 to his name and described how he progressed from peddling on the corner and working in sweat shops to owning a haberdashery in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.
“The Glosser family quickly progressed from selling goods from a horse and wagon to owning a haberdashery in Johnstown run by Nathan and Wolf-Leib to a chain of supermarkets and discount department stores run by my grandfather, Sam, and the next generation of Glossers, including my dad, Izzy,” Glosser wrote. “It was big enough to be listed on the AMEX stock exchange and employed thousands of people over time.

“What does this classically American tale have to do with Stephen Miller? Well, Izzy Glosser, is his maternal grandfather, and Stephen’s mother, Miriam, is my sister,” Glosser continued.
Glosser went on to describe how he has watched with “dismay and increasing horror” as his nephew has become “the architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our family’s life in this country.”
“I shudder at the thought of what would have become of the Glossers had the same policies Stephen so coolly espouses— the travel ban, the radical decrease in refugees, the separation of children from their parents, and even talk of limiting citizenship for legal immigrants— been in effect when Wolf-Leib made his desperate bid for freedom,” Glosser wrote. “The Glossers came to the U.S. just a few years before the fear and prejudice of the ‘America First’ nativists of the day closed U.S. borders to Jewish refugees. Had Wolf-Leib waited, his family would likely have been murdered by the Nazis along with all but seven of the 2,000 Jews who remained in Antopol.”
Glosser then took aim at the Trump administration over its controversial immigration policies.

“As free Americans, and the descendants of immigrants and refugees, we have the obligation to exercise our conscience by voting for candidates who will stand up for our highest national values and not succumb to our lowest fears,” Glosser added.
Miller has been under scrutiny in recent months as the Trump administration continues to face backlash over its “zero tolerance” policy, which led to the separations of hundreds of migrant families caught crossing the border illegally.

(Leah Millis/Reuters)
In an essay for Politico, David S. Glosser launches into a sharp-tongued critique of the immigration views of Stephen Miller, who is both his nephew and a top Trump aide. With a headline calling Miller a “hypocrite” on immigration, Glosser’s essay tells the rags-to-riches story of Miller’s own ancestors, who arrived in the U.S. as poor Jewish immigrants but ended up owning a number of supermarkets and department stores. This inspiring family history is meant to disqualify Miller’s skepticism of chain migration and current refugee programs.

We see this accusation of “hypocrisy” on immigration a lot. It’s been trotted out against Miller, President Trump, and others. So perhaps it’s worth spending a few minutes looking at the limits of the “hypocrisy” charge.
First of all, the current immigration system would also have excluded the ancestors of many Americans. Family preferences constitute the bulk of new immigrants to the United States; these preferences would have excluded past immigrants who had no family connections in the United States when they first immigrated. This is one of the major reasons why accusations of “hypocrisy” on immigration are not a particularly compelling argument against shifting to a skills-based immigration system. Skills-based migration would exclude many would-be immigrants, but so does our current immigration system.
The “hypocrisy” argument falls short on other grounds, too. Saying that you can’t support changing a policy that benefited your ancestors (or even you) would create a bizarre paralysis in political debates. The robber barons of the Gilded Age benefited from a relative lack of inheritance, income, and capital-gains taxes. Does that mean that Vanderbilt and Rockefeller scions can’t support any of those taxes? What about the people who work at the schools, libraries, and other organizations that industrial magnates donated to — are they allowed to support a taxation system that would have shredded the mega-fortunes upon which their institutions relied? Similar arguments could be applied to other policies. The ancestors of some Americans enjoyed higher wages due to the protective tariff, so can they support cutting tariffs? Should someone who benefited from coal technology block the development of other energy sources?

This paralysis points to one of the deepest methodological problems with closing off policy debate through claims of prior benefit. Part of serious politics is about the common good, the achievement of which can sometimes entail personal sacrifices. A soldier goes off to war knowing he might die, but he takes that great personal risk because he thinks that the common good outweighs that danger. Even if a change in regulations or taxation might hurt a voter, that voter might still support those changes because she believes they are best for the nation as a whole. If politics is to be more than self-dealing, policymaking needs to take into account what is in the national interest. (It’s worth noting that claims on behalf of the common good and the national interest do not necessarily oppose claims on behalf of individual liberty; one might believe that defending certain liberties is part of the common good.)
Now, one might argue that Miller’s preferred policy changes are not in the national interest. But the “hypocrisy” charge detracts from this argument."
6475,"Immigrant recruits booted by the Army left facing deportation, death'",New York Post,8/10/2018,,,https://nypost.com/2018/08/09/immigrant-recruits-booted-by-the-army-left-facing-deportation-death/,"Xiongzhou Zhang’s dream of becoming an American by joining the Army started to fade away with a pounding at the door of his upstate home last month.
A Chinese immigrant and master’s student, Zhang had signed up to join the Army in 2016 with the promise of expedited citizenship for his service, which included Mandarin language skills the Pentagon needed.
But instead of a uniform, Zhang found himself wearing an ankle bracelet after about 10 immigration agents raided the Rochester home he shares with his wife and 20-month-old son on the morning of July 16, threatening the couple with deportation because his legal status had expired.
“We relied on my contract to pursue our dreams,” said Zhang, 29.
“The contract didn’t bring us the citizenship, the job, the salaries and the respect. It just put us under arrest.”
He is one of dozens of recruits whom the Army has discharged in recent months with little explanation since the Trump administration last year disbanded the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest , or MAVNI, program that was designed to recruit highly skilled legal immigrants like Zhang into the armed forces.
Stringent new background checks meant many of the recruits couldn’t get cleared for basic training — for reasons many still don’t know.
A July 20 Army memo made public Thursday by The Associated Press revealed officials have been ordered to stop processing such discharges.
But it’s unclear what that means for those who haven’t been cleared or would-be soldiers like Zhang who have already been given their marching orders.
For now, they’re stuck in a dangerous limbo — because returning to their native countries after joining the US military could be a death sentence.
That was the dilemma facing Brooklynite Yousuf Istajab: risk his student-visa status expiring while he was awaiting clearance for basic training, or return to his native Pakistan and face persecution for joining the US Army Reserves.
“I can’t take the risk of my life and go back while serving in the Army,” said Istajab, 33.
He chose to file for asylum in the US as a last resort, marking a growing trend of US military members fearing deportation to countries where they could be treated as traitors.
Immigration lawyers say they are being swamped by immigrants in the armed services desperate for help to stay in their adopted country.
“It’s crazy,” said Margaret Stock, a retired Army Reserve lieutenant colonel who helped create the MAVNI program and has filed a dozen asylum cases so far.
“They are in the US military, and now they have to claim asylum in America. They should have legal status, and they should have citizenship.”
Maurice Goldman, an immigration attorney in Tucson, Ariz., filed two asylum cases recently for immigrants who signed contracts with the military but now are at risk for deportation to countries where they will be persecuted.
“These are people who were given a raw deal,” Goldman said.
“They agreed to assist the US military and put their own life at potential risk and defend our freedoms in return for the possibility of US citizenship . . . I believe that the US government breached their contract by not standing up to its end of the bargain.”
Neither the Pentagon nor the US Citizenship and Immigration Services could provide information on how many military members have resorted to seeking asylum.
After pledging an oath to the United States, Zhang, too, fears going back to his native country could mean persecution for his family.
He initially came to America legally to pursue a higher education and better opportunities. His girlfriend later followed, and they were married in New York, where their son was born.
Zhang joined the immigrant-recruitment program to earn citizenship and had planned to serve in the Army for 20 years.
For more than two years, he attended weekly meetings for future Army soldiers to meet with his recruiter and to train, while his ship date to basic training got delayed due to the new background check process.
But with the US suddenly canceling his Army contract and his deferred-action status expiring, Zhang and his wife face deportation.
“We chose the MAVNI program because it can guarantee us citizenship within six months after I sign a contract,” Zhang said.
“Two years later, they just threw me away and put me through a deportation process.”
The MAVNI program was developed in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to diversify the armed forces and bring in much-needed language skills.
About 10,000 immigrants joined as a shortcut to US citizenship, but over the years, the program fell under increased scrutiny and oversight, and finally last year, the Pentagon suspended the program entirely.
The Department of Defense also changed the rules to require recruits who were still in the pipeline to undergo special new background checks before shipping out and warned that these checks could take more than a year to complete.
Recruits must sit without access to a phone or computer for a daylong interview during which investigators grill them about every aspect of their life.
They must document their foreign travel since birth, their financial information and spending habits, a list of all associates “living or dead” who have been connected with any government and detailed information on “all foreign-born associates and relatives” they have ever had contact with, according to the manual for the counterintelligence screenings reviewed by The Post.
“The type of background check they are trying to get the noncitizen soldier to pass is as if he was going to be Jared Kushner working in the White House,” said Zhang’s attorney, Beverly Cutler.
“They are giving them our nation’s highest level of national security testing and to not pass that has nothing to do with whether you are qualified to be a citizen.”
The Pentagon didn’t have information on how many recruits passed the new standards, but it contends that the average ratio of passage is two out of three and that the tougher standards were needed for national security.
“The problem with the MAVNI program [is] we found that it was really vulnerable to insider threats and espionage and terrorism and other criminal activity. When that became apparent, we had to do something,” said Pentagon spokeswoman Maj. Carla Gleason.
She said the Pentagon doesn’t tip off immigration officials to newly discharged immigrant recruits to start deportation proceedings.
“No one is being discharged from the military due to their immigration status. They are being discharged due to security suitability,” she said.
New rules also drastically limited citizenship opportunities for all noncitizen recruits.
Previously, one day of military service was sufficient to apply for citizenship. But under the new rules, 180 days of consecutive active duty service or one year in the reserves is required.
The changes shocked Istajab.
“They welcome you. They say you are in our department and you are a US solider. We took an oath of office,” said Istajab, who is working as a dental assistant.
“We were about to ship [to basic training]. And then all of a sudden, the new government came and said, ‘Hey, we don’t know who you guys are . . . You are strangers in our department.’ It’s kind of rough.”
One Chinese MAVNI recruit from New York learned that he didn’t pass an expanded background check — although not why — but hasn’t been officially discharged and is continuing to drill on weekends in his uniform in the hope the Army realizes he poses no threat.
“I don’t have a ship date. I’m just waiting. I’m hoping they change their mind or they made a mistake,” said the recruit, who has been drilling for more than two years.
In China, his decision to serve in the US Army would be viewed as “treason.”
Evidence compiled by Stock in a separate military asylum case shows a string of threats posted on the Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo against Chinese MAVNI soldiers.
“They betrayed their own country,” one threat said. “Kill them!”"
5061,Army Suspends Its Purge of Immigrant Recruits',New York Times (Online News),8/10/2018,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/us/mavni-program-army-discharge-immigrants.html,"The soldiers were recruited mainly for their language skills or medical training. Many speak strategically important languages like Chinese, Korean or Russian. Many have college degrees, and some are medical doctors. More than 10,000 troops have joined the military through the program since it began in 2008, almost all of them serving in the Army.
In recent years, though, the Defense Department has tightened its vetting of immigrant recruits. Now, soldiers joining up to be clerks, mechanics and surgeons face the kinds of extensive background checks that were formerly conducted for troops who needed top secret clearance. The added layers of scrutiny include screenings by the C.I.A. and F.B.I., a review of at least a decade’s worth of personal finances, an exhaustive questionnaire and numerous lengthy interviews.
The new requirements made processing each recruit take much longer, and the backlog of reviews piled up into the thousands. Many recruits have been waiting for years to get the clearances they need to advance in their military careers, and in some cases, Ms. Cutler said, the process has dragged on so long that screenings done at the beginning have since expired and must be done over again. Then the Army started pushing the recruits out.
“They were being discharged even if there was not a security concern,” she said. “These are often highly skilled individuals, many have master’s degrees.”
In a court filing in July, government lawyers called the Mavni program an “elevated security risk,” and said that some recruits had provided false information to obtain student visas and that others had friends who were associated with foreign intelligence organizations.
However, a 2017 report by the RAND Corporation found no evidence that the Mavni program had caused any security problems. The report, which has not been officially released, found that the program’s recruits were generally better educated and performed better than the average enlisted soldier, and had not been involved in terrorism or espionage.
The military may want to curtail the Mavni program simply because it has become an administrative headache, clogged with too many regulations, said Margaret D. Stock, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve who helped create the program and is now an immigration lawyer representing some Mavni soldiers."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mike Knaak/AP Mike Knaak/AP
The U.S. Army has halted the process of discharging immigrants who enlisted under a program designed to recruit people with critically needed skills.
Reports emerged in July that the Pentagon had canceled the enlistment contracts of dozens of these recruits.
""Effective immediately, you will suspend processing of all involuntary separation actions,"" says the memo from Marshall Williams, the acting assistant secretary of the Army for manpower and reserve affairs.
The program is known as Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest.
""This in no way reflects a change in the Army's compliance with DOD's MAVNI program,"" said Lt. Col. Nina Hill, an Army spokesperson. ""We continue to abide by all requirements to include completing a thorough background investigation on all MAVNI applicants.""
As NPR's Vanessa Romo has reported:
""[MAVNI] was established in 2009 to create an opportunity for the military to enlist people with specialized knowledge, including highly sought-after language and medical skills. ""Those enrolling had to reside in the U.S. legally, such as under student visas, or seek asylum but could not be green card holders. Enlisting gave them a fast-track path to citizenship, sometimes even before beginning basic training.""
The MAVNI program has been officially suspended since 2016, after the Pentagon said its security protocols should be reviewed. But that has left hundreds of people in limbo — and at risk of seeing their visas run out in addition to having their military contracts canceled.
As of April 2018, ""roughly 1,100 people who had signed contracts but had not gone off to basic training"" were still in the pipeline, Maj. Carla Gleason, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon, told NPR last month.
In July, dozens of enlistees were told they weren't eligible to serve in the U.S. military, with officials citing the results of security screenings. But in the case of two recruits who spoke to NPR, those problems seemed to be the existence of any ties outside the U.S.
A reservist who spoke to NPR — and who filed a Freedom of Information Act to discover the reason for his discharge — learned that foreign ties were to blame. His fiancée and his parents live in Pakistan. And despite a reviewer's positive impression of the man and his loyalty to the U.S., he was turned down for service.
Another enlistee, Panshu Zhao, signed up after moving from China to the U.S. for school. He is now pursuing a doctorate in geography at Texas A&M University — but after the military rejected him, he told NPR, ""This is a whole disaster. This is a total mess — a big mess."""
6325,"Trump administration expands government's deportation powers""",Washington Times,7/23/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jul/5/dhs-expands-power-initiate-deportations/,"The Trump administration has expanded the government’s deportation powers, issuing guidelines urging officers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — the legal immigration agency — to begin the removal process for people who use fraudulent documents or who illegally took government benefits.
USCIS officers have always had powers to begin deportation proceedings, but in the past had usually referred cases to other parts of Homeland Security for decisions on deportation.
Now, though, the agency is flexing those powers, with guidance memos telling officers to look for instances where they can begin the deportation process for people they deem illegal immigrants.
The memos, dated June 28, tell agency employees to be on the lookout for people who apply for naturalization or other legal immigration benefit but who have criminal records, used bogus documents, lied about their applications or had abused public benefit programs.
In the past those might have been enough to reject the application, but USCIS would either drop the issue at that point or refer the case to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for possible deportation. Under the new guidelines USCIS employees are now urged to begin the deportation process themselves.
That involves issuing a Notice to Appear, or NTA, which signals the beginning of the deportation process. Someone who receives an NTA then must go before an immigration judge, has the chance to appeal, and only then is deported.
“For too long, USCIS officers uncovering instances of fraudulent or criminal activity have been limited in their ability to help ensure U.S. immigration laws are faithfully executed,” USCIS Director L. Francis Cissna said in announcing the changes.
“This updated policy equips USCIS officers with clear guidance they need and deserve to support the enforcement priorities established by the president, keep our communities safe, and protect the integrity of our immigration system from those seeking to exploit it.”
The new guidance reclaims USCIS’s role as a gatekeeper and expands the number of government employees on the lookout for deportable migrants.
“When fraud, misrepresentation, or evidence of abuse of public benefit programs is part of the record and the alien is removable, USCIS will issue an NTA upon denial of the petition or application, or other appropriate negative eligibility determination,” the guidance says.
USCIS says the move is about efficiency. In the past, it had to wait on ICE to make decisions and ICE would have to track someone down to issue them an NTA. Now, USCIS will be able to do that immediately.
One effect could be to discourage people with bogus claims from coming forward to apply, since they now run a greater risk of ending up in deportation proceedings.
People applying under the Obama-era DACA program are exempted from the new guidance, meaning illegal immigrant “Dreamers” won’t generally have to worry about being put in deportation if their claim is rejected.
The prohibition on sharing their information with ICE is also still in place, according to a second memo released Thursday.

A single mother with two children, she set roots in the Miami suburbs, finding work as a secretary, dedicating herself to her church and, earlier this year, welcoming her first grandchild, a girl named Isabel, after Ms. Borgoño’s middle name.
She took the oath of citizenship in 2007, a step she felt would secure her status in her adopted homeland. But hers, it turns out, is not a feel-good immigrant story: The Justice Department has moved to revoke Ms. Borgoño’s citizenship, an action that could eventually force her to return to Peru.
Federal prosecutors in May filed a rare denaturalization case against Ms. Borgoño, 64, accusing her of committing fraud when she applied for citizenship and failed to disclose that she had taken part in a crime several years before she applied for citizenship — though she had not at the time been charged with it. It wasn’t until four years later, in 2011, that Ms. Borgoño pleaded guilty to helping her boss, to no benefit of her own, defraud the Export-Import Bank of the United States of $24 million.
Since President Trump took office, the number of denaturalization cases has been growing, part of a campaign of aggressive immigration enforcement that now promises to include even the most protected class of legal immigrants: naturalized citizens."

The director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) — an office established in 2003 to process immigrant applications for visas, work permits, green cards and citizenship — told The Associated Press recently that the agency is hiring dozens of lawyers and immigration officers to review cases of immigrants who are suspected of having lied to officials during the naturalization process.

The office made public on July 5 a memo announcing its plan to start issuing notices to appear for a wider range of cases. Those notices, which require an immigrant to appear before an immigration judge on a certain date, can be the first step in deportation proceedings.
Experts say that policy change, coupled with what came next, could vastly expand the number of individuals being referred for removal.
The agency said last week that starting Sept. 11 its adjudicators will have the ability to outright deny applications that are missing information. That’s a departure from an Obama-era policy of sending requests for more evidence or issuing a warning of their intent to deny the application.
“The memos are really, layer by layer, going after people who are in line doing the right things,” Anastasia Tonello, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said.
The administrative changes highlight how Trump officials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsBolton book shows nastiness rules at Trump White House DOJ civil division's leader resigning The end of asylum — for now MORE and White House adviser Stephen Miller, aren’t just seeking to curtail illegal immigration — they’re also taking steps against naturalized citizens in an effort to reduce the number of foreign-born residents in the U.S.
USCIS says the policy changes are an effort to ensure the nation’s immigration laws are faithfully executed to keep communities safe and secure.
Michael Bars, an agency spokesman, said in a statement to The Hill that immigrants can always file an appeal when a benefit is denied.
But immigration experts say the changes — along with the agency’s new mission statement emphasizing the security of U.S. citizens — mark a noticeable shift in an agency that was previously focused on customer service.
“There’s a reason we set up our benefits agency separate from our enforcement agency, and it seems like a bunch of changes have been put in place to make USCIS more of an enforcement agency,” said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. Immigration Policy Program. “It’s problematic and very concerning.”
USCIS called the allegation that it is transitioning to an enforcement agency false and inaccurate.
“The truth is that many open borders advocates believe the U.S. should turn a blind eye to cases of illegal immigration, fraud, human trafficking, gang activity and drug proliferation at the expense of public safety and the integrity of our laws,” Bars said.
“Each year, immigration benefits including the great privilege of citizenship are attainable for many legitimate individuals each seeking greater opportunity, prosperity, and security as newly entrusted members of society,” he said, adding that USCIS is committed to adjudicating all petitions and applications fairly, efficiently and effectively on a case-by-case basis.
The additional lawyers and immigration officials announced in June by USCIS Director L. Francis Cissna are for a new office that the agency says will serve as a centralized location to review and refer appropriate cases for denaturalization to the Department of Justice.
The cases involve individuals who had been ordered to be removed from the country and intentionally used multiple identities to defraud the government to obtain citizenship, USCIS said.
The new office is the byproduct of an investigation completed in 2016 by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) discovered in 2011 that it was missing fingerprint records of immigrants who were fugitives or convicted criminals, as well as those who had deportation orders.
The investigation found that USCIS has granted U.S. citizenship to 858 immigrants who had been ordered deported or removed under another name.
More than 2,500 naturalization cases have been determined to require an in-depth review for possible denaturalization, of which almost 100 have been referred to the Department of Justice for denaturalization, according to USCIS.
So far, six individuals have been denaturalized, meaning ICE will decide whether to pursue deportation proceedings.
With so few denaturalizations for fraud, policy experts say the new office isn’t worth the investment.
Ruth Wasem, a clinical professor of public policy at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, said most people haven’t done anything wrong.
“It’s hard not to think it’s pretty hateful to be assuming people who are trying to go through the legal process are somehow sinister,” she said."

3270,Some migrant children are reunited with parents as Trump administration misses court deadline',Los Angeles Times,7/11/2018,,,http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-deadline-separated-20180710-story.html,"The federal government on Tuesday began its first major wave of reuniting migrant children with their parents amid continued chaos, confusion and legal wrangling over when and how the rest of the thousands of families separated on the border would be brought back together.
The Trump administration said only 38 of 102 children younger than 5 had been reunited with their parents by the Tuesday deadline set by a federal judge in San Diego. The same judge has ordered that thousands of older children should be reunited by July 26.
For the record: An earlier version of this article reported that 34 children under age 5 were expected to be reunited with their families by Tuesday. Administration officials said 38 such children were to be reunited.
Government attorneys said authorities were trying to comply with the order as quickly as possible, while attorneys for the immigrant families said the government could be doing more to speed up the reunifications.
Trump administration officials appeared to soften its hard-line stance on how the detainees are treated, saying the parents of children younger than 5 would largely be released with ankle bracelet monitors rather than being detained indefinitely as a family. They declined to say whether they would similarly release the parents of the much larger group of 2,000 to 3,000 children ages 5 to 17.

The administration’s move to rely on ankle bracelets marks a return to the policy used before the administration began its method of separating parents and children caught illegally entering the country.
U.S. government is asking immigrant parents separated from their children to fill out this lengthy form »
The shift followed an order issued Monday by a federal judge in Los Angeles, rejecting the Justice Department’s request to modify a long-standing legal settlement outlining how long immigrant minors may be detained. The 1997 agreement, known as the Flores settlement, requires that minors be released “without unnecessary delay.”
In court Tuesday, Justice Department attorneys told the San Diego judge that they believed the two orders still allowed the administration to ask parents detained at the border to either waive the right to remain with their children, as recognized in the San Diego case, or waive the Flores settlement’s maximum 20-day limit that a child can be forced to spend in immigration detention.

Judge Dana Sabraw asked attorneys what happens if a parent doesn’t want to waive either right.
Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the parent would have to file a separate lawsuit claiming lack of due process.
“We are hopeful the government will do the right thing,” Gelernt said.
Carlos Holguin, an attorney who represents immigrant minors in the Los Angeles case, said the administration was forcing parents to make a tough choice.

“The families are still in a very difficult position, either remain in custody together, or separate” so their children can be released, said Holguin, who offers counsel with the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law. “The government doesn’t have to do that. They can resume the policies and practices that were prevailing a year or two ago, release families together if they show credible fear of returning to the country of origin.”
Holguin said part of the difficulty for the administration appeared to be the dearth of facilities designed to detain families as a unit.
Across the country Tuesday, dozens of children were being allowed back into their parents’ arms after weeks apart as administration officials said they were doing their best to reunite families in a safe and expeditious way.
Three Honduran fathers in Grand Rapids, Mich., who were reunited with their children, two girls and a boy, were “just holding them and hugging them and telling them that everything was fine, and that they were never going to be separated again,” immigration lawyer Abril Valdes said.

One of the fathers, Ever Reyes Mejia, walked out of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement center carrying his beaming son and the boy’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles backpack.
Meanwhile, parents who remained separated from their older children remained in limbo, plagued with heartbreak and confusion.
Two Central American mothers, whose daughters are being held in South Texas shelters, said they were told reclaiming their girls from federal government-contracted shelters could take weeks and would require jumping through numerous bureaucratic hoops. Both asked to be identified by their first names only because their asylum cases are pending.
Janet, 46, and her 15-year-old daughter Jenny were detained crossing the Rio Grande on a smuggler’s raft in late May and separated from each other. Janet was released Monday with a notice to appear in court but has been unable to be with her daughter, who remains at a shelter in San Benito, Texas.

“So much time has passed. I want to take her with me. We’ll see if they give me the chance,” she said. Officials have told the volunteers helping her, with the nonprofit Grassroots Leadership, that in order to be reunited, she would have to clear a rigorous screening process, including fingerprinting and background checks.
Isabella, 40, hasn’t seen her 17-year-old daughter Diana since they swam across the Rio Grande 40 days ago near Hidalgo, Texas.
She was released Monday on $1,500 bond without an ankle monitor. A childhood friend drove from Maryland to help her find Diana. Her daughter, who she located at a Brownsville, Texas, shelter last week, has struggled psychologically with the separation, Isabella said.
“I’m praying to God to give me my daughter soon,” she said, adding that she hopes officials will be moved by the plight of the thousands of children still separated from their families. “I think this will touch the heart of the president.”

6137,"DNA tests, criminal charges complicate effort to reunite illegal immigrant families'",Washington Times,7/11/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jul/10/dna-tests-criminal-charges-complicate-effort-reuni/,"The federal government has caught at least five adults whose claims to be parents of illegal immigrant children were disproven with DNA tests. Eight more had serious criminal records, including murder and kidnapping charges, that made them unfit to take back their own children, the government said Tuesday.
Those were among the tougher cases the government has had to sort through as it rushed to make a judge’s deadline for reuniting the youngest of the children separated in the aftermath of President Trump’s zero-tolerance border policy.
Federal officials signaled Tuesday that they were scrapping the policy for dozens of families, preparing to release them rather than detain them, as the president had promised.
Yet even with that retreat, the government was still struggling to meet the deadline imposed by Judge Dana Sabraw.
Just 38 of the original 102 separated children under age 5 were guaranteed to be reunited by Tuesday, officials said. Another 16 were on the bubble for reunification, the government said, saying it depended on whether they were able to finish out a series of checks to make sure the children weren’t heading to unsafe conditions.
Judge Sabraw told them to speed it up, saying they could cut corners on their usual process in order to get the kids back with people who claimed to be their parents.
“These are firm deadlines. They’re not aspirational goals,” the judge said during a hearing Tuesday to get an update on progress.
Judge Sabraw ruled last month that separating families violated illegal immigrant parents’ rights. He blocked separations going forward and gave the government 14 days — until Tuesday — to reunite children under 5 who’d been separated and were still in government custody. He set another deadline of July 26 for juveniles ages 5 to 17 to be reconnected.
Between 2,000 and 3,000 children separated from parents are in government custody, with 102 of them falling into this week’s under-5 deadline.
Government officials insisted they were working in good faith.
Of the 102 children under the immediate deadline, they said four had already been released by Tuesday afternoon and another 34 were about to be turned over to parents. Sixteen children were awaiting final DNA tests on people who’d cleared background checks but still needed to have their relationship confirmed, while one other parent had a criminal background check that was still being resolved.
Another 12 children belonged to parents who’d already been deported, and the government was unsure how to handle those — other than to try to reach them in their home countries. And eight parents had been released into the U.S., and needed full safety checks, the government said.
In the final 27 cases, officials say, they’ve ruled out reunification, at least for now.
Ten parents are serving time in federal or state jails or prisons and can’t be reunited until their sentences are done. One child’s parent has been missing for more than a year — and it’s possible both the child and parent are American citizens.
Eight parents had major criminal records that made them unsuitable candidates to take custody of their children, one parent was deemed a danger for child abuse, one parent lived in a home where another occupant had a child sex-abuse charge pending, and another parent has a communicable disease that must be cleared up.
Then there are five of the 102 cases where adults had claimed to be parents, but those claims were disproved once the government started to investigate by DNA tests.
Officials said those cases are evidence for why the government needs to do extensive vetting before turning children over.
“Our process may not be as quick as some would like but there is no question it is protecting children,” said Chris Meekins, a high-ranking official at the Health and Human Services Department.
In some of the toughest cases, Mr. Meekins said, they have found two instances of men who assert parentage but DNA tests come back negative.
He said it’s possible the men don’t know they aren’t the biological fathers. In those cases, if the adults are proved to be parents through other means such as birth certificates, they’ll bury the DNA results, saying it’s not their role to interfere in whatever the family situation is.
Judge Sabraw, though, was not impressed with the government’s lengthy checks.
He ordered a “streamlined approach” for vetting parents, saying DNA tests should only be used if there’s a specific reason to suspect fraud.
“The court could not have been clearer that business as usual is not acceptable,” said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer handling the case for the families on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union. “The Trump administration must get these children and parents reunited.”
In pushing to meet the deadlines the government signaled it’s ended the zero tolerance policy of holding illegal immigrants until they can be deported, at least in these cases.
Instead, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement expects to quickly release most of the parents and children. In some cases the parents will be given ankle bracelets to try to make sure they appear for their immigration court proceedings.
Matthew Albence, the executive associate director at ICE for Enforcement and Removal Operations, said they don’t have high hopes that will lead to the people being deported when the time comes. He said ICE released 80,000 people under alternatives to detention last year, and just 2,400 were actually deported.
“That is not an effective removal tool,” he said.
Trump critics, though, said deportations aren’t as important as reuniting children and parents — and they said it was a black eye on the Trump administration that it missed the court’s deadlines.
“This is an abject failure and a betrayal of American values,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat. “Congress has a moral obligation to stop this, since the Trump administration has demonstrated that it lacks the competency to do so.:”
The government’s struggles to reunite the first 102 children led critics to say they have no faith the reunification of more than 2,000 juveniles 5 and older will be smoother.
Federal officials declined to give reporters a timeline for those reunifications Tuesday, saying they would wait for more guidance from the court.

2049,Judge rules that Trump administration has been wrongly detaining asylum seekers',USA TODAY,7/3/2018,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/07/02/judge-rules-trump-administration-has-been-wrongly-detaining-asylum-seekers/753151002/,"A federal judge ruled on Monday that the Department of Homeland Security has violated its own policies by refusing to release most asylum-seekers from immigration detention even if they are likely to win their asylum case.
District Judge James Boasberg in the District of Columbia ordered the department to stop making blanket determinations against most asylum-seekers and resume the long-standing practice of deciding each applicant's detention status on a case by case basis.
Boasberg pointed to data provided by the nine plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit to show how dramatically detention determinations have changed under President Donald Trump.
In recent years, Homeland Security allowed more than 90 percent of asylum-seekers who had proven they have a ""credible fear"" of returning to their home country to be released in the U.S. to await their final hearing before an immigration judge. Since President Donald Trump took office, those rates plummeted to 8 percent in Los Angeles, 2 percent in Detroit, and 0 percent in El Paso, Philadelphia and Newark. the locations where the plaintiffs are being held.
""Although Benjamin Disraeli decried 'lies, damn lies, and statistics,' the numbers here are irrefutable,"" Boasberg wrote. ""The dramatic departure in parole-grant rates from years past has not been explained in any way by (the government).""

Foreigners can be granted asylum if they prove they have a ""credible fear"" that they will be persecuted in their home country based on their race, religion, nationality, or are members of a particular social group or political opinion.
That system has come under attack by the Trump administration since
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has claimed that the asylum system is being abused by foreigners who know how to game the system to win entry to the U.S. He has also argued that current asylum laws are too broad, announcing last month that victims of domestic violence or gang violence are no longer automatic grounds to win asylum in the U.S.
Boasberg's ruling did not address that change. Instead, the judge issued a nationwide, preliminary injunction that requires the Department of Homeland Security to abide by its own 2009 directive that requires individualized reviews of each case.
The judge ruled that the department has been making blanket detention decisions, contrary to the 2009 directive.
""To mandate that ICE provide these baseline procedures to those entering our country – individuals who have often fled violence and persecution to seek safety on our shores – is no great judicial leap,"" wrote Boasberg, who was first appointed to the D.C. Circuit by President George W. Bush. ""Rather, the issuance of injunctive relief in this case serves only to hold Defendants accountable to their own governing policies and to ensure that Plaintiffs receive the protections they are due under the Parole Directive.""
The lawsuits was filed in March by legal groups representing nine jailed asylum-seekers.
The plaintiffs include an ethics teacher from Haiti who was attacked after teaching his class about government corruption, a Venezuelan who was threatened for participating in marches opposing the country's communist government, and a gay Honduran man who was threatened at gunpoint.
One has been held in U.S. custody for over two years. Others have been held for months at a time, claiming they have received little explanation for why they continue to be detained.
The judge did not order that the plaintiffs be released from custody, only that Homeland Security officials must show that they are making fair detention determinations for each person. The main grounds for denying parole to an asylum-seeker are that they pose a public safety threat or represent a flight risk.
The practical effect, according to attorneys who filed the lawsuit, is that the Trump administration can no longer use indefinite detention as a deterrent for would-be asylum seekers.
""This ruling means the Trump administration cannot use indefinite detention as a weapon to punish and deter asylum seekers,"" said Michael Tan, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.
The Department of Homeland Security said it not not comment on pending litigation."

The ruling by U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg blocks the Trump administration from keeping asylum-seekers in custody until their immigration proceedings are dealt with.
""This ruling means the Trump administration cannot use indefinite detention as a weapon to punish and deter asylum seekers,"" Michael Tan, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project.
The ACLU, the Center for Gender and Reugee Studes and Human Rights First sued the administration on behalf of nine asylum-seekers, claiming that five U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices had ""almost entirely"" stopped granting asylum-seekers so-called ""humanitarian parole.""
The ICE offices singled out in the lawsuit are in Detroit, El Paso, Los Angeles, Newark and Philadelphia.
The ACLU claimed that the indefinite detention policy violated the Constitution, immigration law, and the Department of Homeland Security's own policy dating back to 2009.
Boasberg agreed, writing that he was doing ""no more than hold the Government accountable to its own policy, which recently has been honored more in the breach than the observance.""
""To mandate that ICE provide these baseline procedures to those entering our country – individuals who have often fled violence and persecution to seek safety on our shores – is no great judicial leap,"" he added.
There was no immediate comment from the Department of Homeland Security or the Department of Justice.

The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups sued in March after finding detention rates at the offices surged to 96 percent in the first eight months after President Trump took office in 2017, up from less than 10 percent in 2013.
AD
The ACLU says the mass imprisonment of people seeking refuge while awaiting immigration court hearings stems from policies promoted by Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions that amount to a deterrent to using the asylum provision. The policy, the ACLU argued, unlawfully denies asylum seekers as a group based on only one of the factors used to assess the danger an individual poses: how long they have been in the United States.
“As the events of recent months make clear, the question of how this nation will treat those who come to our shores seeking refuge generates enormous debate,” Boasberg wrote in a 38-page opinion, an allusion to the administration’s family-separation policy recently implemented and then abandoned amid international condemnation.
AD
“This Opinion does no more than hold the Government accountable to its own policy, which recently has been honored more in the breach than the observance. Having extended the safeguards of the Parole Directive to asylum seekers, ICE must now ensure that such protections are realized,” Boasberg said.
AD
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of nine detained asylum seekers from Haiti, Venezuela and other countries who were initially determined to have credible stories and have been jailed for up to two years awaiting a hearing before an immigration judge, lawyers said. Two have been granted asylum and released since the case was filed in March, said attorneys with the ACLU and the Covington & Burling law firm.
The court action named the Department of Homeland Security and its sub-agency ICE, which detains immigrants, and the Justice Department, which runs the immigration courts where immigrants can seek bond hearings.
AD
The five ICE field offices cited in the lawsuit are Detroit, El Paso, Los Angeles, Newark and Philadelphia, which handle about one-fourth of the nationwide caseload. Plaintiffs said the government at an earlier stage identified nearly 800 class members, a figure they said has now exceeded 1,000.
AD
“This ruling means the Trump administration cannot use indefinite detention as a weapon to punish and deter asylum seekers,” said Michael Tan, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.
Hardy Vieux, legal director for Human Rights First, which also backed the lawsuit, said the decision will have “an enormous impact” on asylum seekers who pose no risk, adding, “It is a rejection of the Trump administration’s blanket policy of denying parole to those seeking protection in this country.”
AD
A Justice Department spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment or to a question about whether the government will appeal.
Boasberg cited a 2009 Department of Homeland Security directive still in force that says the federal government must consider person by person whether an undocumented asylum seeker poses a flight risk or danger to the community, or can be released from detention once they have shown a “credible fear” of persecution in their home country.
AD
Boasberg granted provisional class status to asylum seekers. While the lawsuit is ongoing, the judge barred ICE from detaining applicants for more than seven days without doing a personalized review of their asylum claim, and giving specific written explanations for anyone the government says must be held.
AD
The Justice Department said the case should be thrown out arguing that asylum detention decisions are the sole discretion of government agencies and insulated from court review to prevent asylum applicants from flooding courts with lawsuits.
ACLU Deputy Legal Director Cecelia Wang said the lawsuit targeted another area where the Trump administration has been using “inhumane and illegal” policies of detaining border-crossers to deter others.
Asylum is a provision in federal law that allows foreign nationals to seek permanent residency and eventually, citizenship, if they have a fear of persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or “membership in a particular social group,” a broad category that has included people fleeing gang activity, domestic violence or other circumstances including torture or death.

2015,Thousands turn out in cities across nation to protest separation of illegal immigrant families',TheBlaze.com,7/1/2018,,,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/06/30/thousands-turn-out-in-cities-across-nation-to-protest-separation-of-illegal-immigrant-families,"Thousands of protesters marched in the streets of cities across America to protest the nation’s immigration policies and call for the reunification of parents and children who were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to published reports.
More than one week ago, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to end the practice, but many families still remain separated as the government sorts through their cases.
How many total protests were there?
In all, an estimated 600 protests were scheduled in cities spanning from New York City to Los Angeles. The marchers included open-border advocates as well as conservatives who say families should not be separated.
The total number of protesters could rise to hundreds of thousands, according to some reports. Social media was flooded with photos of those participating and watching the demonstrations.
“Thousands” also turned out in New York City, Boston, Washington, El Paso, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, according to an Associated Press running tally of the protests.
In New York City, protesters shouted “Shut detention down,” a reference to demonstrations held at ICE offices across the country.
Barry Hooper of San Francisco told the Associated Press he attended the protest with his wife and two daughters to “let the president know that this is not acceptable.”
Liliana, his 7-year-old daughter, held a sign she made that read, “Stop the separation.”
Protesters in San Francisco carried flags and signs with with slogans that read, “Deport Trump,” and “I Really Care, Do You?” – a jab at the words written across a jacket the first lady during a visit to an immigrant detention center. Amid a global furor over the immigrant crisis, Melania Trump wore a jacket with the words, “I really don’t care, do u?” written across the back in large white letters.
Trump later said the message on his wife's jacket was directed at the “Fake News Media.”
Celebrities and politicians who oppose Trump were among those participating in a demonstration in Los Angeles, according to the Associated Press.
California Democrats who turned out for the event included Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) Migrant children taken from their parents will suffer lifelong trauma, Harris said.
A rally near the city hall in Portland, Maine was so large that police shut down streets as a reported 2,000 people “chanted, cheered and prayed,” the wire service reported.
In downtown Denver, an estimated 4,000 people attended a boisterous rally. Some of the protesters wore foil blankets, a symbol of similar blankets they gave to children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Others carried signs that included the messages: “Keep the kids, deport the racists” and “Break walls, build families.”
Elsewhere, smaller groups banded together in city parks and downtown squares in virtually every state. Some carried tiny white onesies with the words, ""What if it was your child?"" and ""No family jails,"" according to reports.
The rallies were funded by the American Civil Liberties Union, MoveOn.org, the National Domestic Workers Alliance, and The Leadership Conference, Fox News reported.
Local organizers did most of the planning and coordination efforts. Many of them used informal networks that formed during the worldwide women's marches that happened on Trump's inauguration and its anniversary, the report stated.
What did Trump say?
As the protests were underway, Trump doubled-down on the immigration issue through a series of tweets, including:"
6612,Protesters across U.S. call on Trump to reunite immigrant families',Reuters,7/1/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-protest/protesters-across-u-s-call-on-trump-to-reunite-immigrant-families-idUSKBN1JQ0TP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of protesters marched in cities across the United States on Saturday to demand the Trump administration reverse an immigration crackdown that has separated children from parents at the U.S-Mexico border and led to plans for military-run detention camps.
Outside the White House, protesters waved “Families Belong Together” signs and chanted “Shame!” as religious leaders and activists urged the administration to be more welcoming of foreigners and to reunite families.
“The way they treat families, the way they treat immigrants, that’s not America,” said protester Aneice Germain of President Donald Trump’s tough stance on immigration, a cornerstone of his 2016 election campaign and his presidency. Trump was out of town at a golf club he owns in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Trump says illegal immigration fosters crime and he implemented a “zero tolerance” policy in May to prosecute all immigrants apprehended for entering illegally. That led to the separation of more than 2,000 children from their parents, causing an outcry this month, even from some allies of the Republican president.
In a rare retreat on an issue that fires up his conservative base, Trump on June 20 ordered officials to detain families together.
Thousands of protesters in New York marched across the Brooklyn Bridge bearing signs with slogans like “Make America Humane Again” and “Immigrants Are Welcome Here.” On the U.S.-Mexico border, demonstrators partially blocked a bridge connecting El Paso, Texas with Ciudad Juarez in Mexico.
In Chicago, thousands gathered to march toward the offices of federal immigration authorities. “I’m here because families belong together,” said Cindy Curry of Westchester, Illinois.A federal judge has ordered families be reunited and the administration asked the military to house immigrant families, leading the Pentagon to mull the construction of soft-sided camp facilities.
Organizers estimated 30,000 people had gathered in central Washington. The peaceful protest appeared to be the largest pro-immigration demonstration in the U.S. capital since at least 2010, when activists rallied to pressure then-President Barack Obama and Congress to overhaul the U.S. immigration system.
A splinter group of several dozen protesters in Washington went to protest at what they said was the residence of Stephen Miller, a White House adviser known for his hardline views on immigration. It was the latest in a string of public protests against Trump administration officials.
They held up a sign saying “Stephen Miller, We Know Where You Sleep.”
Since taking office in 2017, Trump has overseen an increase in arrests of people suspected of being in the country illegally. His administration is also approving fewer family visas.
Immigration has been on the rise in America and across much of the developed world for decades, roiling politics in recent years in Germany, Britain and the United States.

Immigrants made up about one in 20 U.S. residents in 1970. By 2016, their share rose to about one in seven, according the U.S. Census Bureau.
On Twitter on Saturday, Trump criticized the handful of Democratic politicians who have called for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency known as ICE to be eliminated.
“You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements,” he wrote in part of the post addressed to ICE employees."
3678,Protests Across U.S. Call for End to Migrant Family Separations',New York Times (Online News),7/1/2018,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/30/us/politics/trump-protests-family-separation.html,"Some showed up because they said they were angry; others, because they said they had not been angrier sooner. Maggie Mason, a new mother, said that for two weeks she could not go on Facebook because of news stories about children in detention centers, such as the audio published by ProPublica of immigrant children crying after being separated from their parents. Now, with her 7-week-old baby sleeping in the stroller next to her, she said it was time to come out.
Over the past month, marches across the country have cropped up, adding to the pressure on the Trump administration to yield to calls to end the practice of splitting up or detaining families.
“The idea of kids in cages and asylum seekers in prisons and moms being separated from breast-feeding children, this is just beyond politics, it really is just about right and wrong,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington State. On Thursday, she was arrested with more than 500 other women who occupied a Senate office building as part of a Women’s March protest against Mr. Trump’s immigration policy.
Ms. Jayapal said she has visited a federal prison just south of Seattle and met with 174 women and several dozen men who had been transferred from the Texas border. She said she was moved by the stories of asylum seekers and parents — stories of family members killed, of children left behind, of violent physical attacks and domestic abuse.
“I promised them that I would get their stories out and I promised them I would do everything I could to reunite their families,” Ms. Jayapal said."

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio both called for the dismantling of ICE this week amid backlash over President Donald Trump's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy.
""I don't think ICE today is working as intended,"" Gillibrand said on CNN Thursday evening. ""I believe that it has become a deportation force, and I think you should separate the criminal justice from the immigration issues. And I think you should reimagine ICE under a new agency with a very different mission and take those two missions out.""
On Friday, Gillibrand echoed her sentiment on Facebook, writing ""We need to abolish ICE.""
De Blasio said in a radio interview with WNYC Friday, ""ICE's time has come and gone.""
He added, ""We should abolish ICE. We should create something better, something different.""
ICE spokeswoman Liz Johnson condemned calls to abolish the agency as ""dangerously misguided.""
""Instead of being insulted with politically-motivated attacks, the men and women of ICE should be praised for risking life and limb every day in the name of national security and public safety,"" Johnson said in a statement. She added that ICE arrested more than 5,000 immigrants who entered the country illegally in New York over the last year,
""removing public safety threats from the streets.""
Both Democrats' comments came after Tuesday's primary win by progressive, Democratic Socialist candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over Democratic incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley for New York's 14th congressional district.
Ocasio-Cortez is one of many progressives who has called for ICE to be abolished.
On Monday, Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., said he would introduce legislation to eliminate the agency.

ICE has been in the center of the storm over family separations at the border. The Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" immigration edict had ICE arresting undocumented immigrant adults entering the country without using legal entry points. Children with those adults were then placed with the Department of Health and Human Services.
President Donald Trump ordered the separations halted, but the details on what is next are being worked out.
Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor at Cornell University Law School who has written extensively on immigration law, told USA TODAY earlier this week that ICE isn't going anywhere soon.
""Even if the Democrats take control of Congress in November, the chances of abolishing ICE are slim to none,"" he said.

In an interview to be aired Sunday with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures,” Trump was asked what he thinks about more Democrats lining up to call for the agency’s abolition.
“Well I hope they keep thinking about it. Because they’re going to get beaten so badly,” he said. “You know ICE, these are the guys that go in and take MS-13, and they take them out. Because they’re much tougher than MS-13, like by a factor of 10. And these are the ones – you get rid of ICE you’re going to have a country that you’re going to be afraid to walk out of your house.”
“I love that issue if they're going to actually do that,” he added.
Calls to “abolish ICE,” once limited to the far-left parts of the Democratic Party base, have shifted into the mainstream mostly in response to the Trump administration’s tough policies on illegal immigration -- particularly the “zero tolerance” policy on detaining all illegal border crossers.
In New York, far-left primary challenger and ICE opponent Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's shocked the party’s establishment by beating Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y. In the days after, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Mayor Bill de Blasio have added their support to the cause.
'ABOLISH ICE' GOES MAINSTREAM AS GILLIBRAND, DE BLASIO BACK CALLS
""I believe that [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] has become a deportation force … and that's why I believe you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works,"" Gillibrand said in a CNN interview Thursday night.
“We should abolish ICE,” de Blasio said Friday morning on WNYC radio. His Democratic colleague in Albany, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, is also facing pressure to back such calls after primary challenger Cynthia Nixon has called ICE a ""terrorist organization.""
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif has said that the U.S. should consider “starting from scratch” while Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., announced on Monday that he would be introducing a bill to abolish the agency.
But, while it was unlikely to gain much traction on the right, Trump also tweeted on Saturday that he was backing ICE agents and that there was “zero chance” of ICE being abolished.
“To the great and brave men and women of ICE, do not worry or lose your spirit. You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements,” he said. “So brave! The radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police. Zero chance, It will never happen!”
Trump is joining a number of Republicans and immigration hardliners who are welcoming the Democratic shift on the issue, believing that it spells electoral victory for the GOP outside of Democratic enclaves like New York and California.
""Based on the last week, Democrats apparently want to campaign on open borders, mass migration, & abolishing ICE,"" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., tweeted this week. ""Give them points for honesty. Let's vote."""
4184,"The movement to 'Abolish ICE' is heating up -- and going mainstream""",CNN (Web News),6/30/2018,,,https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/30/politics/abolish-ice-movement-gaining-support-democrats/index.html,"(CNN) Calls to eliminate the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, for years relegated to the far-left corners of progressive activism, have been thrust this week into the mainstream of Democratic politics.
Cracks in the dam became visible 10 days ago , when a group of demonstrators confronted Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen at a Mexican restaurant in Washington. They called for an end to the Trump administration policy that resulted in separating migrant families at the border and, as the viral protest heated up, began to chant: ""Abolish ICE!""
Less than two weeks on, the demand -- a favored meme on the left -- has gone from a progressive fringe cause, mostly ignored even by some of the most liberal lawmakers, to a political message being embraced by a growing roster of influential national Democrats.
Fueling its sudden ascent have been a series of recent shocks to the system. On Tuesday, US House candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez delivered a stunning Democratic primary upset in New York after campaigning on abolishing the agency, which was formed in 2003 as part of a post-9/11 federal overhaul that created the Department of Homeland Security.
Two days after Ocasio-Cortez's primary, New York's Kirsten Gillibrand became the first senator and potential 2020 candidate to announce her support for the agency's elimination. Less than 12 hours later, on Friday morning, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio joined the chorus , telling WNYC's Brian Lehrer, ""ICE's time has come and gone.""
""I don't think ICE today is working as intended,"" Gillibrand said Thursday night on CNN's ""Cuomo PrimeTime."" ""I believe that it has become a deportation force, and I think you should separate the criminal justice from the immigration issues.""
Thank you, @NYCMayor, for joining the call that seems the separation of children and violation of human rights as an inexcusable bright red line in the United States of America. https://t.co/5Dwxq0XJ9T — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) June 29, 2018
In a Facebook post on Saturday, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote, ""The President's deeply immoral actions have made it obvious that we need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom, starting by replacing ICE with something that reflects our values,"" a line that mirrored her statements in a speech at a protest in Boston.
The rapid escalation was years in the making.
Progressive immigration rights activists -- during both Republican and Democratic administrations -- have come to view ICE as a rogue agency that terrorized immigrant communities. Calls for its dissolution, once rare, are spreading.
A group of 19 agents with its Homeland Security Investigations unit, which deals with complex investigations including transnational crime, recently wrote a letter to Nielsen asking her to break up the agency amid what they described as a debilitating conflation of their work with ICE's deportation activities. Concerns over the public backlash to actions by the Enforcement and Removal Operations division were, they wrote, making HSI's work impossible.
In their message -- first reported by The Texas Observer -- the agents reported that some jurisdictions had agreed only to ""partner with HSI as long the 'ICE' name is excluded from any public-facing information.""
On Capitol Hill, Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin is now working with fellow Democratic Reps. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state and Adriano Espaillat of New York on legislation to eliminate the agency.
In an interview, Pocan said a recent series of aggressive actions by ICE had led him to conclude that it was effectively serving as President Donald Trump's ""own political police force"" -- a tool for creating a sense of crisis to help build support for a border wall and other hardline immigration policies.
For Pocan, Trump's call on Sunday to return immigrants who enter the country illegally without judicial proceedings was the last straw.
""The culmination of all those things, going to the border and then when the President started talking about getting rid of due process, was it,"" he said. ""You're just kind of like, all right, this has gone way astray, and we need to start over.""
But there is dissent now in the Democratic ranks.
Leading progressives, like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and -- until Saturday -- Warren, have stopped short of calling for ICE to be terminated outright and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has circulated talking points advising caution -- arguing in a memo obtained by CNN that ""abolishing ICE without changing President Trump's disastrous immigration policy will not solve the problem."" They're not alone. Some progressives on the Hill worry that wielding the ""Abolish ICE"" banner would be a political gift to Trump and his allies, and that Democrats should consider a more nuanced approach.
Republicans are casting progressive calls to abolish the agency and the recent momentum in the Democratic Party as a move to the far left, evidence that Democrats are weak on border security and immigration enforcement.
""Recent calls to abolish ICE are dangerously misguided,"" agency spokeswoman Jennifer D. Elzea said in an email. ""Instead of being insulted with politically-motivated attacks, the men and women of ICE should be praised for risking life and limb every day in the name of national security and public safety.""
Activists and progressive leaders are pressing on, becoming more aggressive in their push to abolish the agency, an effort many in the movement view as both a way to open up the debate over decades of bipartisan US immigration policy and, crucially, win elections.
""The Democratic Party had a reckoning about the crime bill, financial deregulation and about welfare reform, but it never really had a reckoning about their complicity in creating both the intellectual framework for this sort of policy,"" said Sean McElwee, a leading activist in the anti-ICE movement and early supporter of Ocasio-Cortez's campaign. He cited the 28-year-old Democratic socialist's unapologetic embrace of the issue as a key factor in her Tuesday triumph.
""She had an actual campaign strategy that revolved around ICE, and it was very smart, because (incumbent Rep. Joe) Crowley was weak on immigration and she knew that he would never be able to get where he needed to be to win that primary,"" McElwee said. ""So she just hammered him on it. She didn't shy away from saying it. She put it in her ads. She ran on the issue. She challenged him in the debate. I think 'Abolish ICE' is where it is today because of her leadership.""
Efforts to further escalate the fight beyond the electoral realm are already in motion. The Democratic Socialists of America, which reported its largest spike in new, dues-paying members since Trump's election on the day after Ocasio-Cortez's win, are planning a national campaign to ramp up the pressure.

Maria Svart, the group's national director, said the organization is ready to ""apply pressure wherever possible to lift up the narrative that ICE is horrific, has no place in our communities and needs to be abolished.""
""That looks different in different places,"" she said. ""We have chapters in every state in the country, and folks are doing everything from vigils to encampment to bird-dogging to really raise this issue in the public eye and say, 'We do not submit to this.' ""
Protests have already begun to grow in size and frequency. By Friday afternoon, police in Philadelphia had made six arrests outside the city's ICE office amid a heated demonstration, as crowds chanted, ""I'd rather go to jail than go to a detention center.""
Philadelphia City Council member Helen Gym recorded and tweeted out video of the scenes.

Activists are also seeking to expand the moral dimension of the fight. Hartford City Councilwoman Wildaliz Bermudez, of the Working Families Party, said the visceral nature of reporting from the border during the height of the family separation crisis pushed the movement toward a tipping point.
She likened the situation to what followed the white supremacist rallies last summer in Charlottesville, Virginia.
""It has to be a unified front (in response to ICE),"" Bermudez said, ""because like when you have people chanting on the street, 'You will not replace us,' they're not just talking about Jews. They're talking about everyone."""

“Our Immigration policy, laughed at all over the world, is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years! Immigration must be based on merit - we need people who will help to Make America Great Again!” he added.

The president's suggestion was quickly criticized by groups like the ACLU, which said what he was calling for was illegal.
“What President Trump has suggested here is both illegal and unconstitutional,” Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, told the AP. “Any official who has sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws should disavow it unequivocally.”
The House is expected to vote on immigration legislation this week, but Trump has signaled the lawmakers are ""wasting their time.""
""Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!"" he wrote on Twitter Friday."
4057,Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s authoritarian power-grab: Due process is for wimps',Salon,6/25/2018,,,https://www.salon.com/2018/06/25/donald-trumps-authoritarian-power-grab-due-process-is-for-wimps/,"There is a tendency among the punditocracy to dismiss President Trump's authoritarian rhetoric as nothing more than red meat for his worshipful base: passing Twitter tantrums or hyperbolic salesmanship. He's been doing it from the moment he announced his run for president, when he insulted Latino immigrants as rapists. It continued through the campaign as he endorsed torture, summary executions and banning Muslims from the country. His ongoing paeans to ruthless dictators from Russia's Vladimir Putin to the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte to his recent love fest with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un appear to show a genuine admiration and respect for the most ruthless and violent tyrants on the planet.
Trump admires those men for their willingness and ability to mercilessly rule their countries with an iron fist. His most recent comment about Kim, for instance, even betrays a little envy:
Advertisement:
Hey, he is the head of a country, and I mean he is the strong head. Don't let anyone think anything different. He speaks, and his people sit up at attention. I want my people to do the same.
He later said he was kidding, but it really didn't seem that way. He had absurdly stated a couple of days earlier that Kim's ""country does love him, his people, you see the fervor. They have a great fervor."" He was apparently unconcerned that the ""fervor"" is coerced under threat of imprisonment or death.
Trump plans to spend $30 million to try to create some of that fervor for himself next fall:
Trump was said to have loved North Korean state TV, commenting on how positive the female anchor was about Kim Jong Un. He told former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee last week that American media criticism of his summit meeting with Kim was ""almost treasonous."" That's not the first time he has suggested that failing to praise him adequately amounts to treason. When Democrats did not applaud his alleged achievements during the State of the Union address, he asked a rally crowd, ""Can we call that treason? Why not? They certainly didn't seem to love our country very much.""

This is a man who insisted that everyone always call him ""Mr. Trump"" when he was in business and always demanded strict formality, even among his family members. As president he routinely gathers his cabinet and other members of the government to sit around the big table and robotically extol his virtues. Recall this little pageant from his first cabinet meeting:
Then there's the downright bizarre order to create a new branch of government called the ""Space Force"" (against the advice and opinion of every one of his military advisers) and single-handedly upending the international order with a fatuous ""philosophy"" that the U.S. is running a protection racket and must be paid an ever-increasing ransom by countries who've been our allies since World War II. In these cases and many others, Trump is making unilateral moves without regard to any previous understandings or agreements, whether informal or subject to domestic and international law.
Over the last few months he has cast off anyone in the White House who might have attempted to rein in his worst impulses and is making decisions entirely by the seat of his pants. His authoritarian instincts are no longer just confined to the photo-ops. People around him who share those instincts are growing in influence, particularly senior adviser Stephen Miller, who drafted Trump's first executive order banning travelers from majority Muslim countries. Recall what Miller told John Dickerson on ""Face the Nation"" in February of 2017, when asked whether the White House had learned anything from the experience:
Advertisement:
Well, I think that it's been an important reminder to all Americans that we have a judiciary that has taken far too much power and become, in many cases, a supreme branch of government. One unelected judge in Seattle cannot remake laws for the entire country. I mean this is just crazy, John, the idea that you have a judge in Seattle say that a foreign national living in Libya has an effective right to enter the United States is -- is -- is beyond anything we've ever seen before. The end result of this, though, is that our opponents, the media and the whole world will soon see as we begin to take further actions, that the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.
That too was laughed off at the time. He sounded like a North Korean general. No American could possibly take that seriously, right?
But after all the drama, all the turnover and all the Sturm und Drang of the past year and half, Miller is still there at the right hand of the president. He was obviously instrumental, along with his old boss Jeff Sessions and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, in crafting the ""zero-tolerance"" border policy with all that has stemmed from it. And he's obviously whispering sweet somethings about unfettered presidential power in Trump's ears.

On Sunday the president tweeted this, sending shock waves though the media and the political system:
All this is more thought out than it seems. More than a month ago, Trump was telling Brian Kilmeade on ""Fox & Friends"" that he wanted to eliminate due process at the border:
How do you hire thousands of people to be a judge? So it's ridiculous, we're going to change the system. We have no choice for the good of our country. Other countries have what's called security people. People who stand there and say, ""You can't come in."" We have thousands of judges and they need thousands of more judges. The whole system is corrupt. It's horrible. . . . Whoever heard of a system where you put people through trials? Where do these judges come from?
There is the U.S. Constitution, of course. And laws and international treaties and basic human decency. But Donald Trump does not respect of those things. He is essentially proposing that the Border Patrol and ICE should be allowed to deport anyone they want, since the whole reason for due process is to adjudicate the government's assertion of guilt. If there's no due process there's no way of knowing whether these ""people who stand there and say you can't come in"" are following the law themselves. Harvard professor Laurence Tribe, a scholar of constitutional law, told the New York Times:
Advertisement:
Trump is making the tyrannical claim that he has the right to serve as prosecutor, judge and jury with respect to all those who enter our country. That is a breathtaking assertion of unbounded power — power without any plausible limit.
That's what Kim Jong Un has. Trump would like to have that too. Stephen Miller believes he already does, and that we will all soon see that ""it will not be questioned."" I don't think anyone should be laughing anymore. They aren't joking."

US President Donald Trump has called for speedy deportations that bypass any judicial process in a tweet on Sunday.
""When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came,"" Mr Trump wrote.
His comments come days after Mr Trump reversed a policy to separate migrant children from their parents following fierce backlash at home and abroad.
More than 2,300 children were separated from their parents in May and June.
As of May, all migrants who cross the US border illegally face criminal prosecution under the ""zero tolerance"" policy.
The president did not make the distinction between economic migrants and those seeking asylum.
Mr Trump has faced criticism, including from his own Republican Party, for his choice of language on Twitter.
When he earlier said illegal immigrants threatened ""to pour into and infest our Country"", Republican congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen tweeted back at him saying his ""baseless rhetoric"" was ""repugnant"" and dehumanised those looking for a better life.
US immigration officials say 2,342 children were separated from 2,206 parents from 5 May to 9 June.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Zero-tolerance: The US policy dividing families and opinion
On 20 June, Mr Trump backed down from his support for the policy and signed an executive order ending the practice of separating families.
He said at the time: ""I did not like the sight or feeling of families being separated.""
Mr Trump's directive allows for long-term detention of immigrant children (albeit with their parents), which violates federal law that limits child detention to 20 days.
Tougher language after softened policy
Chris Buckler, BBC Washington Correspondent
A public outcry over migrant children being separated from their parents, forced Donald Trump to soften his immigration policy.
But since then, in a series of speeches, he has called for tougher laws - and claimed America's current legislation is laughed at by the rest of the world.
His latest comments on Twitter go even further.
He says that everyone found illegally trying to cross the border should be returned to their own country immediately - without involving judges or holding court cases.
Political opponents will be furious that that's even been suggested but President Trump clearly believes his supporters back his hardline stance.
Following Mr Trump's election in 2016, the numbers of migrants held or detained entry while crossing the border had dropped significantly.
However, since February 2018, the number of migrants crossing the border illegally is up, with arrests last month more than double those in May 2017.
While illegal crossings cannot be accurately counted, border arrests are used as a measure of illegal border crossings."
5447,"Trump hosts 'Angel Families' to highlight crime by illegal immigrants""",Washington Times,6/23/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jun/22/trump-meet-families-loved-ones-killed-illegals/,"President Trump highlighted “American victims of illegal immigration” on Friday, hosting families of people killed by people who immigrated to the U.S. illegally to tell their stories and hitting back at critics of his rescinded policy that separated some children from their parents who crossed the border illegally.
“These are the American citizens permanently separated from their loved ones,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. “These are the families the media ignores. These are the stories that Democrats and people that are weak on immigration don’t want to discuss.”
He was surrounded on a stage by so-called “Angel” families who lost loved ones to violence by immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally. Many of the parents held large photographs of their dead children.
Referring to the furor over separating children from their parents at the border, in all but a few cases temporarily for investigative purposes, Mr. Trump emphasized repeatedly that the families gathered with him had lost their loved ones forever.
“They’re not separated for a day, or two days,” Mr. Trump said. “They’re permanently separated, because they were killed by criminal illegal aliens.”
One of the parents, Steve Ronnebeck, talked about his 21-year-old son Grant, who was shot and killed for a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store.
“You don’t hear these stories, and some of our media won’t talk to you about it,” Mr. Ronnebeck said. “But this is permanent separation.”
He said he places a Christmas tree on his son’s grave each year.
Laura Wilkerson of Pearland, Texas, recounted the story of her son Josh, who was tortured and killed in 2010.
“None of our kids had a minute to say goodbye,” she said. “We weren’t lucky enough to be separated for five days, or 10 days. We’re separated permanently. We can never have them back on this Earth.”
She added, “We can’t speak to them, we can’t Skype with them,” referring to outrage over migrant children who have been separated from their parents being able to speak with them on the phone only twice a week.
Several family members urged the audience and Mr. Trump to support their grass-roots organization, Fight Sanctuary State, to encourage state and local authorities to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement agents instead of shielding illegal immigrants.
“If we don’t kill this in California, it will spread,” said Drew Rosenberg, who lost his son, of the sanctuary-city and -state movement. “It’s a death sentence for American law-abiding citizens.”
Sabine Durden, a legal immigrant from Germany, told the story of her Dominic, 30, who was killed in Moreno Valley, California, in 2012 when his motorbike was hit by an immigrant from Guatemala, who was living illegally in the U.S. and had prior convictions including two DUIs.
“It took me five years to become a citizen, a proud citizen,” she said. “And I didn’t drag my son … over borders, through deserts. I didn’t place him in harm’s way. I came here the right way.”
She said the man who killed her son had been deported once, but returned to the U.S. and enjoyed sanctuary in Riverside, California.
“The judge, the DA, they knew who he was,” she said. “They gave him probation after his second DUI. Five weeks later, he killed my child. The public needs to know, and they deserve to know, that this could happen to each one of you at any given second.”
After the death of her only child, Ms. Durden said she was going to kill herself, until Mr. Trump announced his candidacy for president in 2015.
“President Trump, coming down that escalator that day and talking about illegal immigration, stopped me in my track,” she said. “And I thank President Trump, Vice President [Mike Pence] … I thank everybody out here. Make sure you get our stories out.”
Showing the audience a locket, she said: “I brought my son. This is what I have left — his ashes. I wear his ashes in a locket. This is how I get to hug my son. So remember, when you go and hug your kids, that there are many of us, thousands of us, who don’t get to do that any more. Let’s work together and get this done — all politicians. I don’t care what side you’re on. You don’t want your child in a casket or in an urn.”
Mr. Trump said he invited the families to the White House “because the news media has overlooked their stories.”
“I want the American people to hear from them directly,” he said. “For years their pain was met with silence … but no more. Their loved ones have not died in vain. We will secure our borders. Eventually, the word will get out.”
Mr. Trump cited statistics of crime committed by immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally, including 600,000 criminal offenses committed by more than 250,000 migrants over the past seven years in Texas alone. He also noted that 15,000 Americans died of heroin overdoses in 2016, with 90 percent of heroin coming across the southern border.
The president also again criticized Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland, California, who alerted immigrants who crossed into the U.S. illegally to a federal raid earlier this year to thwart their capture. He mistakenly referred to her as the mayor of San Diego.
“What are they going to do about looking at her, by the way?” Mr. Trump said. “I’ve been asking this question for four weeks.”
Among the “Angel” family members invited by the White House were:
• Agnes Gibboney, who lost her son Ronald da Silva after he was shot and killed by a gang member, who crossed the border illegally.
• Juan Pina, who lost his 14-year-old daughter Christy Sue in 1990, allegedly at the hands of a Mexican national who raped and killed her. Her alleged killer was extradited from Mexico last month.
• Michelle Wilson-Root, whose 21-year old daughter Sarah was killed in 2016 following a vehicular accident allegedly caused by Edwin Mejia — who had entered the country illegally and, as a result of “catch-and-release” loopholes, was released into the U.S. interior as an unaccompanied minor. According to media reports, Mejia’s blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit.
• Sabine Durden, who lost her son Dominic, a sheriff’s dispatcher, following a fatal vehicular accident in Moreno Valley, California.
• Mary Ann Mendoza, who lost her son, Mesa Police Sgt. Brandon Mendoza, in 2014 following a vehicular accident with a migrant who was allegedly driving drunk at three times the legal limit.
• Billy and Kathy Inman, who lost their son 16-year-old Dustin in 2000 following a vehicular accident allegedly caused by an immigrant who entered the U.S. illegally. Mrs. Inman, who was also in the vehicle, was left permanently disabled because of her injuries.
• Don Rosenberg, whose 25-year-old son Drew Rosenberg died in 2010 following a vehicular accident allegedly caused by an individual who had entered the country illegally.
• Maureen Maloney, who lost her son 23-year-old son Matthew Denice following a vehicular accident in 2011 caused by a man who was driving drunk and had entered the U.S. illegally. The man who caused the accident was later sentenced to 12 years in prison.
• Maureen Laquerre, whose brother Richard Grossi died in 2009 following a vehicular accident allegedly caused by a previously deported migrant.
• Kimberly Roberts and Chris Stansberry, who lost their 18-year-old daughter Tierra, following a fire allegedly set by a migrant who entered the U.S. illegally.
• Ray Tranchant, who lost his daughter 16-year-old daughter Tessa in 2007 to a migrant who was driving drunk.

The big picture: Trump's administration has been embroiled in a major fight this week on immigration, primarily over the implementation of child separation. Meanwhile, The families who spoke today criticized the media for not covering their stories, and thanked Trump and Pence for their commitment to them.

“All politicians, I don’t care what side you’re on … get it together for God’s sake, for this country, for our citizens.”
“I am so honored and proud of you Mr. President, the integrity and honor you have shown us … pulling the daggers out of your back every day hasn’t been fair.”

President Donald Trump on Friday put a spotlight on families who lost loved ones killed by undocumented immigrants — calling them victims of “permanent separation"" — as he sought to shift the attention away from his administration’s recently halted policy of separating migrant families at the border.
It was a dramatic way to end a week that saw Trump make a rare reversal in the face of public outcry, and presented a counterargument as mothers and fathers told grisly tales of their children being tortured and murdered — and claimed the media has not covered their stories.

“You know, you hear the other side. You never hear this side. You don't know what's going on. These are the American citizens permanently separated from their loved ones. The word permanently being the word that you have to think about,” the president said Friday afternoon.
“They're not separated for a day or two days. These were permanently separated because they were killed by illegal aliens. These are the families the media ignores. They don't talk about them. Very unfair.”
One by one, mothers and fathers took turns at the podium, invited by the president to share their stories. One mother recalled that her son had been repeatedly strangled and set on fire after he was dead. A father told the crowd of administration officials and law enforcement officers that his daughter had been kidnapped, raped and killed in 1990 and her body left naked in an artichoke field.

Another father, whose son was shot and killed while working as a clerk on an overnight shift, said his family sets up a Christmas tree on his son’s grave every year. Holding a challenge coin he had been given by acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan, the father said, “I wish some of our media had the same integrity as our president, our vice president.”
Trump mostly steered clear of directly addressing the family separation issue that sparked an international backlash, although some of the parents alluded to it in their remarks. The president’s comments were more somber than his Twitter outburst early Friday morning, in which he accused Democrats of telling “their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections.”
Several of the parents carried large photographs of their deceased sons and daughters, many of which appeared to have been autographed by the president.
“I was going to end my life. I had no purpose, but President Trump coming down that escalator that day and talking about illegal immigration stopped me in my tracks. And I had no clue at that point that I would ever be at the White House,” one mother, who wore the ashes of her son, killed by a drunk driver, in a locket around her neck. “Remember when you go home and hug your kids that there are many of us, thousands of us who don't get to do that anymore.”
The event marked the end of a week which the White House spent fully on the defensive, pushing back against a tidal wave of outcry over its policy of referring all illegal border-crossers for prosecution, a practice that resulted in the forcible separation of thousands of children from their parents.
Early in the week, the Trump administration held fast to its position that the administration’s hands were tied on family separation by established law, even though no such law exists and the policy was the result of a Justice Department policy directive that could be easily reversed.
The White House also argued that the practice could only be ended by a change in the law and therefore it was obstinate Democrats, unwilling to accede to the president’s broader immigration demands, who were to blame for the separations.
With both White House arguments proving untenable and public pressure mounting in the wake of photographs of children kept in cages at a Texas facility and audio of them crying out for their moms and dads, Trump signed an executive order Wednesday intended to keep families together at the border.
But even after the president’s order, confusion remained as to what would happen to the already separated families and how exactly families crossing the border illegally would be treated moving forward.
While administration spokespeople were steadfast in their positions, they quickly found themselves on an island, with Republicans on Capitol Hill growing increasingly vocal in their criticism of the practice.
The issue remained contentious Friday afternoon on Capitol Hill, where Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), played audio of children wailing inside a detention center on the House floor as Rep. Karen Handel (R-Ga.), who was presiding over the chamber at the time, tried to gavel him down, accusing him of violating House rules.
Throughout the week, administration officials complained often that the media’s coverage of illegal immigration and the issue of family separation neglected to reflect the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, a group Trump spotlighted frequently on the campaign trail. Friday’s event, portions of which were carried live by all three major cable news networks, seemed an effort at redirecting the media’s attention.
“I cannot imagine it being any worse, but we promise to act with strength and resolve,"" the president said. “We’ll not rest until our border is secure, our citizens are safe and we end this immigration crisis once and for all… Your loved ones have not died in vain.”"

AD
The president has been on the defensive this week because of his “zero-tolerance” enforcement policy that has led to at least 2,500 migrant children being separated from their parents. While Trump signed an executive order Wednesday ending the practice, he has bristled at the sympathy directed toward the migrant families and argued without evidence that many of them are criminals and intent on doing harm once in the United States.
AD
“We must maintain a Strong Southern Border,” Trump tweeted Friday morning. “We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections.”
The administration has struggled to implement the hastily drafted executive order, which was intended to end the controversy over family separations by stating that parents and children could be detained together. But the Homeland Security Department interpreted it as meaning they would no longer refer for prosecution the cases of adults illegally crossing the U.S. border with children because of to a lack of space at existing facilities for housing detained families. The Justice Department wanted the prosecutions to continue.
AD
Administration officials met late Thursday and on Friday to try to hash out these differences as well as to come up with a plan for reuniting the migrant families that have already been separated.
AD
At the White House event Friday, Trump and many of the family members who spoke criticized what they called one-sided media coverage that does not focus on their stories.
“We weren’t lucky enough to be separated for five days or 10 days; we’re separated permanently,” said Laura Wilkerson, whose son Josh was killed in 2010. “Any time we want to see or be close to our kids, we go to the cemetery, because that’s where they are. We could never speak to them, we can’t Skype with them.”
AD
The president blamed Democrats for what he called weak immigration laws and policies that treat those in the country illegally too leniently, even though Republicans control Congress and failed this week to pass an immigration bill out of the House because of opposition from GOP members. Trump railed against the MS-13 gang, heroin from outside the United States, and so-called “catch and release” immigration enforcement.
AD
Trump also said he does not believe research that shows undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than ­native-born citizens, but did not specify how he came to that conclusion.
“I always hear that, ‘Oh, no, the population’s safer than the people that live in the country,’ ” Trump said. “You’ve heard that, fellas, right? You’ve heard that. I hear it so much, and I say, ‘Is that possible?’ The answer is it’s not true. You hear it’s like they’re better people than what we have, than our citizens. It’s not true.”
AD
The president also falsely claimed that 63,000 Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The number appears to come from a 2006 blog post from Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who advocates limiting immigration, that was based on conjecture, not statistical evidence.

Trump’s comments on immigration this week have roiled the debate in Congress, where House Republican leaders were attempting to pass legislation that could satisfy conservatives and moderates.
On Friday morning, Trump tweeted that Republicans should stop “wasting their time” on immigration, suggesting they put off efforts to pass legislation until after the November elections, when he predicted more GOP members of Congress will be elected.
AD
Trump’s comments came after Republican leaders in the House abruptly postponed a vote Thursday on a broad immigration bill intended to unite GOP moderates and conservatives, acknowledging they lacked the votes to pass the measure despite the growing uproar over separating migrant families at the border.
Trump’s tweet, GOP aides said, could make the task of corralling votes for the bill significantly more difficult, though House Republican leaders said negotiations would continue. The House defeated a bill supported by conservatives on Thursday.
AD
“Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November,” Trump wrote. “Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!”

Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said Trump was “expressing his frustration” at a lack of Democratic involvement on the issue and that efforts will continue to find enough votes to pass a bill. But Scalise acknowledged it would be “an uphill fight.”
“We’re going to move forward,” he said. “We’re going to have a vote. . . . It would be nice if you had at least one Democrat who was willing to vote for a bill that secures America’s border, and so far none have been willing to do that.”
Responding to Trump’s latest tweets, Democrats — who are optimistic they will pick up seats in both chambers of Congress in November — said it was Trump who is standing in the way of immigration reform and trying to create a political issue. They have expressed frustration that the Republican bills were crafted without their input.

The bill set to be voted on next week would provide $25 billion for Trump’s long-sought border wall, offer a pathway to citizenship to young undocumented immigrants known as “dreamers” and keep migrant families together in detention centers.
Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.), a member of the whip team in the House, said Trump could make a difference in passing legislation if he were more emphatic about what he wants.
“If the president said to a given bill, ‘That’s my bill, that’s the one I want,’ I think that would have a pretty significant impact on our discussions,” Byrne said. “But he hasn’t done that yet, and so we’re continuing to work without that.”
AD
Despite the GOP leadership’s vows to fight on, some Republicans were openly skeptical about their ability to achieve success in the wake of Trump’s latest tweets.
AD
“Game over,” Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) said during an interview on CNN. “It takes the wind out of the sails in what might have been a fairly productive week in terms of looking for compromise. I don’t know how it happens, because if you look at how contentious this issue is, how much emotion there is, without the president being out front — without the president having legislators’ backs — there’s no way they’re going to take the risks that would be inherent in a major reform bill.”
GOP aides noted the difficulties. The chances of a bill passing are “not good, and worse with the POTUS tweets,” said one aide, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the sensitive issue. Another said Trump would be to blame if legislation fails.
The president seemed unconcerned, having already turned his attention to November’s midterm elections.

3637,Trump urges Republican lawmakers to drop immigration effort',Reuters,6/22/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration/trump-urges-republican-lawmakers-to-drop-immigration-effort-idUSKBN1JI1CI,"SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lilian Merida-Galicia and her 7-year-old daughter were apprehended after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona and separated by U.S. officials in mid-May.
Since then, the 23-year-old Guatemalan has been trying to learn her daughter’s whereabouts, according to her attorney, Michael Avenatti. At one point she sent a note to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
“Please could you send me a phone number so that I can communicate with my daughter?” read the note, which was written in Spanish and seen by Reuters.
An ICE officer replied in a note in English: “I do not have this information.”
Merida-Galicia, who is being held in California, is just one of many incarcerated immigrant mothers whose attorneys tell similar stories about chaotic situations in which the mothers don’t know where their children have been taken or how to contact them. The mothers themselves could not be contacted because access to detained immigrants is difficult.
Although President Donald Trump abruptly reversed course on Wednesday following a wave of outrage at home and overseas and abandoned his policy of separating children from parents who are apprehended for illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, the fate of the more than 2,300 children already separated from their parents while Trump’s policy was still in force is unknown.
Avenatti, who has made headlines representing porn star Stormy Daniels in an unrelated lawsuit against Trump, said Merida-Galicia is among more than 60 immigrant parents he represents and 80 percent of them do not know where their children are.
The federal government and Congress scrambled on Friday to address the many unanswered questions raised by the hastily drafted executive order Trump issued on Wednesday.
Attorney Luis Cortes Romero in Kent, Washington, said he represents a Salvadoran woman who was separated in early May from her 11-year-old daughter with Down syndrome after the two crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas. The woman is being held in Washington state and has decided she doesn’t want to pursue asylum so that she can be deported and reunited with her daughter, he said.
“She said she never wants to come back, and that this experience has been so traumatizing,” Cortes Romero said.
Trump suggested on Friday that some of the wrenching tales that have emerged from the border were fabricated by Democrats.
“We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections,” he tweeted.
CONGRESS STUMBLES
Trump urged Republican lawmakers on Friday to drop their efforts to pass comprehensive immigration legislation until after the November congressional elections, flip-flopping on his appeal earlier in the week for Congress to act soon.
Trump has gone back and forth on ways to solve the country’s immigration problems, which he blames on Democrats.
“Elect more Republicans in November and we will pass the finest, fairest and most comprehensive Immigration Bills anywhere in the world,” Trump said on Twitter.

“Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!” he said.
All 435 House seats and a third of the 100-member Senate will be up for grabs in November. Democrats are hoping that discontent among voters with Trump’s policies, including on immigration, will help the party make gains in Congress and flip control to Democrats in at least one chamber.
The House of Representative on Thursday rejected a bill backed by conservatives that would have halted the practice of splitting up families and addressed other immigration issues. The House postponed until next week a vote on a more moderate bill after it failed to attract enough support for passage. But Trump’s latest tweets could doom that effort.
“Game over,” said Representative Mark Sanford, a Republican critic of Trump who came under withering attack from the president before losing his primary race this month.
“Without the president having legislators’ backs, there’s no way they’re going to take the risks that would be inherent in a major reform bill,” Sanford told CNN.
Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican who represents a majority Hispanic district in Florida and is not running for re-election, said Trump’s tweets amounted to “schizoid policy making.”
REUNIFICATION UNCLEAR
Even though the president has now ordered that families be kept together in detention during immigration proceedings, it remained unclear how and when those children already separated would be reunited with their parents, and where families would be held while the parents face criminal charges.
The U.S. Navy is drafting plans to house up to 25,000 immigrants on its bases and other facilities, at an estimated cost to taxpayers of about $233 million over six months, a U.S. official said on Friday.

But the Navy has not so far been asked to provide accommodation for migrants who have entered the United States illegally, and the official, who asked not to be named, stressed that the draft memo, which looks at setting up housing on Navy airfields in Alabama, was for planning purposes only.
The Department of Homeland Security on Friday filed a notice saying it may need up to 15,000 more beds to handle immigrant families. That would be a sharp increase from the 2,500 beds available for families in the last fiscal year.
Shares in private prison operators CoreCivic Inc and Geo Group rose on Friday as investors bet on increasing demand for their services after U.S. authorities asked about available capacity for the detention of immigrant families.
It was also unclear if the government would keep prosecuting cases against people caught crossing the border illegally. It was the administration’s policy of zero tolerance - announced in April - that led to blanket prosecutions, including of adults traveling with children."

USA TODAY
President Donald Trump, bowing to a deepening humanitarian crisis along the southwest border, signed an executive order Wednesday that promises to halt family separation while insisting that the administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy to prosecute all illegal immigrants would continue.
“We’re going to have strong, very strong borders, but we’re going to keep the families together,"" Trump said. ""I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated.""
Vice President Mike Pence and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stood by his side when he signed the order in the Oval Office.
""Thank you for your leadership, sir,"" said Nielsen, who has become the public face of the administration's policy that led to separation of children from adult immigrants charged with illegal entry.
The order's title, ""Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation,"" puts the onus on lawmakers to provide a long-term fix with legislative action.
It authorizes DHS to keep families together when they are detained at the border, unless officials determine that the child's welfare is at ""risk."" It also authorizes the Defense Department to provide facilities for housing those families.
Also under the order, the Justice Department was directed to prioritize the prosecution of cases involving families.
Justice officials had been working since early Wednesday on a draft of the order aimed at reversing politically-charged policy that has resulted in the separation of more than 2,000 children of adult illegal immigrants in the past month, an official familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The scope of the order, however, did not address how the already-separated children would be re-united with their parents.
The text of the document appeared only to apply to families of future illegal immigrants, while fates of the existing detainees — children and adults — are likely to be left to Congress to resolve.
The first signs that Trump was preparing to act emerged early Wednesday, as Nielsen huddled with the White House to discuss possible options, including an executive order, while Attorney General Jeff Sessions worked with Justice officials on the mechanics and language that would ultimately preserve the administration's promise to prosecute all those accused of illegal entry.

Hours later, Trump announced that he would take action to end family separation.
“I’ll be signing something in a little while that’s going to do that,"" Trump said after he was asked about stopping the separation of families at the border. ""I’ll be doing something that’s somewhat preemptive and ultimately will be matched by legislation, I’m sure.”
The controversial zero tolerance policy was first announced more than a month ago by Sessions.
“If you cross this border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you,” Sessions said in the shadow of California's busiest border crossing in San Diego. ""If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law.”
Some of the most intense public pressure to reverse course, had been applied to Nielsen, the public face of the strategy, and Sessions, the architect of the zero tolerance policy.
Late Tuesday, protesters heckled Nielsen as she ate dinner at a downtown Washington, D.C., Mexican restaurant. And for his part, Sessions was rebuked by separate coalitions of state attorneys general and former federal prosecutors who called on the attorney general to halt the practice of separating children from their parents.
Sessions also was the target of public condemnation from United Methodist clergy and lay members who suggested that that actions taken by the administration and the attorney general were akin to child abuse.
Still, prior to his announcement, Trump again blamed Democrats for the problems, asserting that Republicans wanted security.
""I am working on something - it never ends!"" he tweeted."
2178,Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Plan To Stop Family Separations Is To Detain Families Together',HuffPost,6/20/2018,,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-republicans-family-separations-plan_us_5b2a8b03e4b0a4dc992364e0,"President Donald Trump’s plan to stop his administration’s policy of separating immigrant children from their families seems simple: Lock up immigrant parents and their children together, indefinitely.
But there’s no evidence that Trump has the legal authority to make his wish reality. His plan, issued in an executive order on Wednesday, conflicts with a 2015 court ruling that required the government to release child migrants from detention after 20 days. Trump can’t dismiss federal judges’ rulings by decree. So his executive order will trigger a massive showdown between his administration and human rights activists in court.
“These are protections for kids. That’s the doctrine here,” said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute’s office at the NYU School of Law. “And if anything goes against the protection of kids, it will be challenged.”
Trump administration officials have insisted that they enacted the family separation policy in part because of a 2015 court order over a 1997 court settlement called the Flores agreement. The Flores agreement and the ensuing 2015 ruling limit the length of time that children can be detained, including with their parents. Most detained immigrant children must be released within about 20 days to continue their deportation proceedings outside of detention. In the past, the federal government has generally released the children’s mothers from family detention along with them rather than splitting them up.
The Trump administration has said this policy effectively creates “catch and release” for families, and proposed changing it through legislation. But getting immigration policy through Congress is an uphill battle.
Yuri Gripas / Reuters President Donald Trump unveiled an executive order on Wednesday to address his administration's policy of separating immigration children from their families. But the plan conflicts with a 2015 court ruling that required the government to release child migrants from detention after 20 days.
Trump said when he signed the order that a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry would continue, meaning the administration will still aggressively pursue prosecution of parents. Now, according to his order, parents being prosecuted will be locked up with their kids in most circumstances while criminal proceedings go forward ― and even after, while they pursue immigration cases. Those proceedings can take years.
The order conscripts the entirety of the federal government into mass immigrant family detention. It instructs heads of government agencies to make facilities available for family detention, to the extent permissible by law. The Department of Defense is instructed to also “construct such facilities if necessary.” The order says the Department of Homeland Security will reimburse these other agencies for the expense.
The policy isn’t a reversal of his border crackdown; it’s a continuation of it.
“I think the word compassion comes into it,” Trump said at the White House. “But it’s still equally as tough, if not tougher.”
Now, as the backlash against family separation at the border grows, Republicans in Congress are floating measures to spike the Flores agreement and its accompanying court orders, freeing up the Trump administration to keep families together by locking them up indefinitely in family detention centers. One proposal would reportedly divert some of the $7 billion originally marked for border security infrastructure to expand upon the three family detention centers that Immigration and Customs Enforcement currently runs.
If that legislation were to pass, it wouldn’t have an immediate impact, according to Peter Schey, one of lawyers who represents children in the ongoing class action lawsuit over the Flores Agreement.
Instead, the government would have to go to court to ask the judge to terminate the agreement, he said. If that happens, Schey and his team of lawyers will oppose. If they lose after a lengthy appeal process, they’ll turn around and file a similar lawsuit that could put the federal government in the exact same situation it was in before trying to kill the settlement through legislation.
“Even if they succeed in getting some legislation that’s onerous and inhumane, I wouldn’t be surprised if a year or two later we can get it set aside,” Schey said.
It’s hard to predict how the courts might rule. But the basic elements of the settlement ― that child migrants should be treated humanely and freed from detention if they don’t present a danger to the community or a flight risk ― are already part of U.S. immigration law. And U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee, who presides over the case, repeatedly hammered the Obama administration with harshly worded rulings in the years that it tried to expand family detention to deal with an influx of Central Americans seeking asylum.
Congress has wide latitude to change immigration laws, which could make a legal challenge more difficult, Chishti said. But Congress cannot pass laws that violate the Constitution, and there are concerns that long-term family detention could violate the rights of those detained.
A policy change made by Trump alone would be even more susceptible to litigation, Chishti said. Trump has already run into problems with his administrative actions on immigration, including his travel bans, attempt to eliminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for undocumented young people and efforts to punish so-called “sanctuary cities” for not fully cooperating with deportation efforts.
Trump said Wednesday that he thinks Congress would follow up his executive order with legislation, but that’s not a guarantee ― it’s unclear whether any of the legislative proposals put forward so far, some of which are vague, have enough support to pass.
Immigrant rights advocates argue that Trump and Congress should pursue alternatives to family detention, which would allow kids and parents to be together and monitored by immigration officials during their removal proceedings, just not locked up.
“The two cornerstones of the settlement don’t seem to be very controversial,” Schey said. “It’s been hard to see how Congress might say, ‘No ― we want to treat these children inhumanely.’ Or ‘No, we want to detain these kids even if they have a viable sponsor and they’re not a threat to others.’ If that’s not true, what’s the justification for insisting on their detention?”
Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House immigration subcommittee, predicted on Wednesday that if Trump tried to violate the Flores agreement, the action would wind up blocked by a judge.
“The Flores settlement is in place for a reason, which is that indefinite incarceration of children in prisons is not a good thing for them and not necessary, whether it’s by themselves or with their parents,” she told HuffPost. “To repeal that is not consistent with American values.”"
6750,Trump signs executive order stopping family separation',Washington Times,6/20/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jun/20/trump-says-sign-something-stop-family-separation/,"President Trump signed an order Wednesday ending the separation of families at the border, moving to end a crisis that engulfed his administration and threatened to derail his hopes of progress on broader immigration reforms.
The changes don’t end the new zero-tolerance policy that pushes for criminal prosecutions of illegal immigrants who jump the border — indeed, it enshrines the policy in the executive order.
But it does mean those families arrested for sneaking in will be held in immigration detention facilities, rather than separated, with parents sent to criminal justice system jails and kids handed off to Health Department-run dorms.
“What we have done today is we are keeping families together. The borders are just as tough, just as strong,” Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office as he signed the order, flanked by Vice President Mike Pence and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.
It’s not clear what the order means for the more than 2,300 children who were already separated. The government has been unable to say how many of them were already reunited, and couldn’t say Wednesday what will happen now in those cases.
And much of the success of the order depends on being able to hold families in detention longer than 20 days — which will require overturning a 2015 court case that imposed the 20-day limit. Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ask the court to revise its ruling, and he urged Congress to step in and pass legislation to solve the matter once and for all.
“This is a stopgap measure. The president’s doing everything he can here within the bounds of existing authority,” said Gene Hamilton, a senior aide to Mr. Sessions.
But immigrant-rights groups were furious, saying that while they didn’t want children separated from families, neither did they want families to be detained.
“Family incarceration is not the answer to ending family separation, and moving children from one cage to another is an outrage,” said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a leading liberal think tank.
Indeed, Mr. Trump’s decision Wednesday seemed to rip the bandaid off the immigration fight, exposing the scabs of years of stalemate.
On one side was the administration and many Republicans, who argued that people who come to the country illegally should be quickly deported, and the only way to ensure that is to hold them in detention, which makes sure they show up for their hearings.
Opposing Mr. Trump are Democrats and immigrant-rights groups that argue many of the illegal immigrants should be treated as refugees, should not be held in detention, and should be given government-funded lawyers to help them argue their cases for why they should be allowed to stay.
Signing the order marked a major retreat for the president, who for the last week had blamed Democrats for the separations and said it would take a change in law to stop it.
On Wednesday, Mr. Trump talked about the “dilemma” he felt he was facing.
“The dilemma is that if you’re weak — like some people would like you to be — if you’re really, really pathetically weak, the country’s going to be overrun with millions of people,” Mr. Trump said. “And if you’re strong, then you don’t have any heart. That’s a tough dilemma. Perhaps I’d rather be strong, but that’s a tough dilemma.”
The crux of the zero-tolerance policy is using the criminal code to try to deter illegal immigration. For decades, it’s been a crime to jump the border — though past administrations used those provisions only sparingly.
The Trump administration has said it wants nearly 100 percent prosecutions.
Currently those charged with crimes are supposed to be held by the Justice Department, whose jails are not equipped for family custody. Homeland Security does have some family detention facilities, but they are used for people in the immigration system, not the criminal justice system.
House Republicans’ new immigration bill, expected to be voted on Thursday, includes a provision that would write into law the ability for the government to keep migrants in criminal proceedings in Homeland Security facilities.
The House bill would only apply to parents charged with misdemeanors. Those with felony charges, such as smuggling or reentering the country after a previous deportation, would still go to the Justice Department under the House plan.
Keeping families together in Homeland Security detention will likely require an infusion of cash to create more family detention space.
Mr. Trump ordered the Defense Department and other federal agencies to offer whatever space they could.
The Obama administration, which faced its own surge of illegal immigrant families in 2014 and 2015, tried to open family detention centers but was met with fierce opposition by immigrant-rights advocates who said it was cruel to keep families detained.
They renewed those objections Wednesday.
“Even if families are detained together, it is just as harmful as family separation,” said America’s Voice, a leading advocacy group, citing psychologists.
The number of families surging toward the U.S. has increased dramatically this year. Activist groups say they’re fleeing horrific conditions back home, while Mr. Trump says they’re being enticed to the U.S. by “loopholes” and other lax policies, realizing that if they can show up with children they’ll be quickly released and can disappear into the shadows with the 11 million other illegal immigrants already here.
That spurred the zero-tolerance policy, which kicked in fully in early May.
Homeland Security officials said that from May 5 through June 9 they arrested 4,538 people who snuck into the U.S. traveling as families and who faced separation. That included 2,206 adults who were prosecuted and sent to jail to await their proceedings, leaving 2,342 juveniles as Unaccompanied Alien Children who had to be stuck in government-run dorms.
Usually the adults serve a few days in jail, plead guilty to illegal entry charges, are sentenced to the time they already served, and are released back into the immigration system.
Senate Republicans on Wednesday introduced a bill that would try to permanently stop family separations by allowing them to be kept together in Homeland Security facilities for a longer period of time. The legislation would set mandatory conditions for the family detention centers, and it would also try to shorten the time immigration cases take by adding more judges and giving priority to these cases.
The GOP bill, combined with Mr. Trump’s move, puts the focus back on Democrats.
They were conflicted.
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said Mr. Trump made the right move — and said he hoped the administration would move quickly to reunite the more than 2,000 children already taken from parents.
But his top lieutenant, Sen. Dick Durbin, blasted Mr. Trump and demanded he end detention altogether for the families in question.
“Locking up whole families is no solution at all — the Trump administration must reverse its policy of prosecuting vulnerable people fleeing three of the most dangerous countries on earth, who are attempting to seek safe haven in America,” the Illinois Democrat said.

2419,"Trump blesses House Republicans' new compromise immigration bill""",Washington Times,6/20/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jun/19/donald-trump-blesses-house-republicans-immigration/,"President Trump blessed House Republicans’ compromise immigration bill “1,000 percent” Tuesday, giving political cover to conservatives looking to back the bill and creating momentum ahead of a showdown vote expected this week.
He said the legislation, which grants citizenship rights to illegal immigrant “Dreamers,” funds his border wall, limits the chain of family migration and ends the visa lottery, checks off all the boxes on his immediate immigration wish list.
Meeting with Republicans for an hour Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump told them he would welcome a fix to the family separation issue that has engulfed the immigration debate this week. But he made clear that any action would have to come from Congress, not from the administration.
His blessing clears up the mess he left Friday when he said he wouldn’t sign the bill. The White House later said he misunderstood the question, but his wavering left a number of conservatives fearful of voting for the bill only to have the president walk away from the legislation, leaving them on a political ledge.
“He says, ‘I am behind you 1,000 percent and I am not going to leave you out to dry,’ ” said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Washington Republican and chairwoman of the House Republican Conference.
Whether that is good enough to win the votes of 218 Republicans — the number needed to approve the bill — is unclear.
“It’s going to be close,” said Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican who helped craft the compromise bill. “This is a very challenging issue, very controversial. All members are going to have to take some risks to make this happen.”
Rep. Mark Meadows, North Carolina Republican and head of the Freedom Caucus, said he is still weighing his vote, but the bill is a no-go for other conservatives.
“I think there are some who believe that it is amnesty, and they don’t want to vote for amnesty,” he said.
He also said some on the liberal side of the party wanted a more generous legalization for Dreamers.
“We represent very different districts,” he said. “The thing that motivates me to stay involved is I think the moderates negotiated in good faith — whether we get to 218 or not, I don’t know.”
Republican leaders released the official version of the bill Tuesday evening while Mr. Trump was meeting with them.
The bill would grant full legal status and a path to citizenship to people who qualify for the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The bill also would end the visa lottery and limit the types of family members who can be sponsored for immigration. It takes those visas and uses them for the DACA population and other children brought to the U.S. illegally as minors by their parents.
In terms of enforcement, the bill allows the Department of Homeland Security to detain more people and deport them faster, and it increases the threshold for people attempting to claim asylum, with a goal of reducing fraudulent claims that have clogged the system.
Republican leaders tucked in a fix for the family separation issue, allowing the government to hold children and their parents in immigration detention facilities for longer than 20 days. The bill also says that illegal immigrant parents charged with misdemeanors, who normally would be sent to the criminal justice system’s jails, can be held in immigration detention — meaning they can remain with their children.
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, told The Washington Times that Mr. Trump got a good reception from the party.
“It was great,” he said.
Outside the meeting, a group of Democrats marched along the corridors holding signs that said, “Families Belong Together,” and that depicted some of the now-iconic photos of children and their parents at the border.
As the president walked through one of the Capitol’s corridors, a heckler shouted at him, “Mr. President, F– you!” An NBC reporter said on Twitter that the culprit was a congressional intern.
Earlier Tuesday, some of the president’s key supporters warned him against embracing the bill.
The National ICE Council, the union that represents officers at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said the bill falls short on a number of the president’s campaign promises.
Chris Crane, the council president, wrote a letter to Mr. Trump saying the bill would open the door to massive fraud, would allow people who defy judges’ deportation orders to get on a pathway to citizenship and would fail to make good on Mr. Trump’s promise of a deportation force of 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.
He labeled the bill the “Ryan amnesty” and said it repeats the mistakes of the failed 2013 “Gang of 8” immigration bill.
“You pledged publicly to ‘have the backs’ of the men and women of ICE law enforcement. I am asking you to keep that promise,” Mr. Crane wrote.
The ICE Council endorsed Mr. Trump on the campaign trail in 2016.
Rep. Bob Goodlatte, Virginia Republican, said he is “sympathetic to their concerns” but that the compromise is better than alternative proposals that they would have hated.
“But we really have to do something that can get to 218 votes, and some of the people who are in that negotiation did not support their request,” Mr. Goodlatte said. “This happened very quickly, and if they don’t think they were consulted enough, I understand that.”
The White House did not respond to questions about the letter.
Republican leaders plan two votes this week.
One would be on an enforcement-heavy bill written months ago by Mr. Goodlatte and Rep. Michael T. McCaul, Texas Republican. Both chair key committees. That bill includes a renewable DACA permit but doesn’t give Dreamers a pathway to citizenship. It does include a host of new enforcement measures such as requiring employers to use E-Verify to check their hires, cracking down on sanctuary cities and making it a misdemeanor to overstay a visa.
Those measures went too far for many Republicans, and the Goodlatte bill struggled to reach 218 supporters.
So Republican leaders pushed Mr. Goodlatte, Mr. McCaul and moderate lawmakers to work on the compromise bill.
Mr. Trump had backed the enforcement-heavy bill, but his full-throated support for the compromise was critical.
“Folks that would have been against it, I think it’s harder for them to be against it now,” said Rep. Bill Flores, Texas Republican. “I think he probably changed a lot of minds.”

5143,Trump says would back both House immigration bills as separation crisis grows',Reuters,6/20/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration/trump-says-would-back-both-house-immigration-bills-as-separation-crisis-grows-idUSKBN1JF177,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump told Republican lawmakers on Tuesday he would back either of the immigration bills making their way through the House of Representatives, as the outcry grew over his administration’s separation of immigrant parents and children at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Representative Mark Meadows said Trump told Republican members of the House at a meeting on Capitol Hill that they needed to get something done on immigration “right away.”
In the meeting, Trump said separating families was “certainly not an attractive thing and does look bad,” added Representative Tom Cole.
Congressional Republicans have been scrambling to craft legislation as videos of youngsters in cages and an audiotape of wailing children have sparked anger at home from groups ranging from clergy to influential business leaders, as well as condemnation abroad.
A Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll released on Tuesday showed fewer than one in three American adults supporting the policy. The June 16-19 poll found that 28 percent of people polled supported the policy, while 57 percent opposed it and the remaining 15 percent said they did not know.
Trump, who has made a tough stance on immigration a centerpiece of his presidency, has staunchly defended his administration’s actions. He has cast blame for the family separations on Democrats, although his fellow Republicans control both chambers in Congress and his own administration implemented the current policy of strict adherence to immigration laws.
The president has sought to link an end to the family separations to passage of a wider bill on immigration, which would include funding for his long-sought border wall with Mexico, prompting Democrats to accuse him of using children as hostages.
“In his remarks, he endorsed both House immigration bills that build the wall, close legal loopholes, cancel the visa lottery, curb chain migration, and solve the border crisis and family separation issue by allowing for family detention and removal,” White House spokesman Raj Shah said of Trump.
An unidentified person yelled an obscenity at the president before he entered the meeting.
Earlier on Tuesday, the president tried again to blame Democrats for what he called “loopholes” in the law that require families detained for entering the country illegally either to be separated or released.
“These are crippling loopholes that cause family separation, which we don’t want,” he said in remarks to the National Federation of Independent Business, adding he wanted Congress to give him the legal authority to detain and deport families together.
BILL WOULD PREVENT SOME SEPARATIONS
House Republicans were working on a revised draft of one version of an immigration overhaul that would prevent family separations in some cases for those attempting an illegal border crossing for the first time, according to a House Republican aide.
The draft bill was seen just days ago as unlikely to pass, but has gained support in the House, and it was unclear whether the new language about preventing family separations would improve its chances for passage.
Both Republican bills under discussion, which have been blasted by Democrats and immigration advocacy groups, would fund the border wall and reduce legal migration, in part by denying visas for some relatives of U.S. residents and citizens who are living abroad, sometimes referred to as “chain migration.”
The more conservative bill from Representative Bob Goodlatte would also deny “Dreamers,” immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children, the chance of future citizenship.
Several hundred protesters marched in New York City, chanting “Keep families together!”
Anne Heaney, 74, a retired teacher, held a sign that read, “Children do not belong in cages. Maybe Trump and Pence do.”
In Washington, activists stood next to a table occupied by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjien Nielsen in a Mexican restaurant, voicing criticism of the administration’s policy, according to video obtained by Reuters.
Two top U.S. business groups, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, decried the separation policy on Tuesday and called for its immediate cessation.

“My heart goes out to the impacted families,” said JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who chairs the Business Roundtable, in a memo to the bank’s employees. “Fixing these issues will clearly boost the economy,” he added.
Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook described the separation of children from parents at the U.S.-Mexico border as “inhumane” and promised to be a “constructive voice” in seeking to end the issue, the Irish Times newspaper reported.
Microsoft Corp CEO Satya Nadella called the policy cruel and abusive in an email to employees that was posted on Linkedin.com. He also said the company is not working on any projects with the U.S. government related to separating children from their families at the border.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection said on Tuesday that 2,342 children had been separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border between May 5 and June 9.
The separations began after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in April that all immigrants apprehended while crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally should be criminally prosecuted.
Parents who are referred by border agents for prosecution are held in federal jails, while their children are moved into border shelter facilities under the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a Department of Health and Human Services agency.
LEGISLATIVE POSSIBILITIES
A number of Republican senators called on Trump on Tuesday to allow families to stay together if they had crossed the border illegally, and Senate leaders said their chamber could have legislation to address the family separations matter in a matter of days.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said: “We hope to reach out to the Democrats and see if we can get a result, which means making a law and not just get into some kind of sparring back and forth that leads to no conclusion,” he said.
Top Democrats contended that Trump could change the policy with the stroke of a pen.
“The president is trying set this trap in the public mind that somehow there is a law requiring him to do this and Congress can undo it,” said Senator Chris Van Hollen, who visited a detention center in Brownsville, Texas, over the weekend. “We know this is a problem that was manufactured six weeks ago, and we’re seeing the awful results today.”

Decrying “internment camps,” Democrats and their supporters disrupted a U.S. congressional hearing on Tuesday about an FBI probe.

Meanwhile, it emerged that Trump administration officials have been sending babies and young children forcibly taken from their parents at the US-Mexico border to at least three “tender age” shelters in south Texas.
Lawyers and medical providers who have visited the Rio Grande valley shelters described playrooms full of crying preschool children.
Kay Bellor, the vice-president for programs at the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said: “The thought that they are going to be putting such little kids in an institutional setting? I mean, it is hard for me to even wrap my mind around it. Toddlers are being detained.”
Steven Wagner, an official with the Department of Health and Human Services, said: “We have specialised facilities that are devoted to providing care to children with special needs, and tender age children, as we define as under 13, would fall into that category.
“They’re not government facilities per se, and they have very well-trained clinicians, and those facilities meet state licensing standards for child welfare agencies, and they’re staffed by people who know how to deal with the needs particularly of the younger children.”
At a closed-door meeting with House Republicans on Capitol Hill, members said Trump expressed concern for the families being separated by the “zero-tolerance” policy, but he did not take responsibility for the practice. Instead, the president urged the Republicans in the room to pass legislation that keeps families together.
After the meeting, the Florida Republican congressman Carlos Curbelo said: “The president does want this to end.”
Curbelo, who has led the charge for immigration reform, said Trump told members that Ivanka Trump had appealed to him to stop separating families. However, the president gave no indication that he was willing to reverse the policy and did not acknowledge that he could stop the separations without legislation, he added. Instead, Trump insisted Congress deliver a legislative solution.
Unbowed by mounting public anger, Trump and leading administration officials have fiercely defended the policy, which has led to the separation of more than 2,300 children from their parents in five weeks.
Before the meeting on Tuesday evening, as the president walked through the Capitol, a protester yelled: “Mr President, fuck you.”
As Trump left the session, he faced a rare demonstration by members of Congress. House Democrats shouted at the president to abandon his immigration policy while waving signs that read: “Families belong together.”

The California congressman Juan Vargas shouted: “Mr President, don’t you have kids? Don’t you have kids, Mr President? How would you like it if they separated your kids?”
Speaking to reporters, Trump said: “We had a great meeting. These are laws that have been broken for many years, decades. But we had a great meeting.”
Quick guide Why are families being separated at US border? Show Hide Why are children being separated from their families? In April 2018, the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, announced a “zero tolerance” policy under which anyone who crossed the border without legal status would be prosecuted by the justice department. This includes some, but not all, asylum seekers. Because children can’t be held in adult detention facilities, they are being separated from their parents. Immigrant advocacy groups, however, say hundreds of families have been separated since at least July 2017. More than 200 child welfare groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the United Nations, said they opposed the practice. What happens to the children? They are supposed to enter the system for processing “unaccompanied alien children”, which exists primarily to serve children who voluntarily arrive at the border on their own. Unaccompanied alien children are placed in health department custody within 72 hours of being apprehended by border agents. They then wait in shelters for weeks or months at a time as the government searches for parents, relatives or family friends to place them with in the US. This already overstretched system has been thrown into chaos by the new influx of children. Can these children be reunited with their parents? Immigration advocacy groups and attorneys have warned that there is not a clear system in place to reunite families. In one case, attorneys in Texas said they had been given a phone number to help parents locate their children, but it ended up being the number for an immigration enforcement tip line. Advocates for children have said they do not know how to find parents, who are more likely to have important information about why the family is fleeing its home country. And if, for instance, a parent is deported, there is no clear way for them to ensure their child is deported with them. What happened to families before? When an influx of families and unaccompanied children fleeing Central America arrived at the border in 2014, Barack Obama’s administration detained families. This was harshly criticized and a federal court in 2015 stopped the government from holding families for months without explanation. Instead, they were released while they waited for their immigration cases to be heard in court. Not everyone shows up for those court dates, leading the Trump administration to condemn what it calls a “catch and release” program. By Amanda Holpuch Read more
House Republicans, barrelling towards a vote on a pair of immigration bills, were hoping the president would rally skeptical members of the caucus around a proposal that sought common ground between moderates and conservatives on an issue that has fiercely divided the party.
Instead, Trump said he would sign either proposal that came to his desk, members said.
The Kansas Republican congressman Kevin Yoder said: “He said we need to pass one of the two bills.” He added that the president was “agnostic” about which of the two measures they should pass.
The Florida Republican congressman Mario Díaz-Balart said: “Here’s what I’m absolutely – 1,000% – sure of. “Without his [Trump’s] support, without his approvals, there’s no shot of it passing the House, there’s no shot of it going anywhere.”
During his remarks, which were expected to focus on immigration, Trump spoke about his recent visit to North Korea and his trade policy, members said. He also openly mocked the Republican congressman Mark Sanford, a conservative critic of the president who lost a primary this month after Trump endorsed his opponent, they said.

The meeting came at a delicate moment for Republicans, as several lawmakers in both chambers rushed to defuse the spiralling political crisis caused by the immigration crackdown.
Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said “all of the members of the Republican conference support a plan that keeps families together” and endorsed a narrow plan that would allow law enforcement to detain parents and children together while their immigration case is adjudicated in court. McConnell said he hoped to pass a bill as early as this week.

Any such legislation would require some support from Democrats, who immediately rebuffed the plan, arguing that Trump could unilaterally end the practice.
The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said: “There is no need for legislation. There’s no need for anything else. You [Trump] started it, you can stop it – plain and simple.”
Under the policy, all adults are arrested for crossing the border illegally. As children cannot be kept in an adult prison, they are held separately.
In the House, Republicans have included a provision to end family separations in their compromise immigration proposal, which would also provide $25bn (£19bn) for Trump’s border wall and his other hardline security demands. The bill would offer a pathway to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers. A rival bill, supported by a conservative bloc of Republicans, would not guarantee them a path to citizenship.
Trump did not discuss whether he would back a standalone measure should support for the immigration proposals flounder. The president has called on Democrats to negotiate an end to the separations, inviting criticism that he is leveraging the crisis at the border to win support for his hardline immigration framework.
The House is expected to vote on the immigration measures this week and their fates are far from certain.

The president said at the meeting that if Congress doesn’t give him the resources he needs for border security, he will shut down the government in September, according to one of the people familiar with the meeting. He did not give a specific number, but has been fixated on getting the $25 billion in a lump sum.
In fact, the $1.6 billion figure came from Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, who attended the meeting. Mulvaney submitted the request to Congress earlier this year, though the administration has since upped its ask to $2.2 billion.
Senate Democrats offered to provide $25 billion in border wall funding earlier this year in return for giving 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship. But Trump and most Republicans rebuffed that proposal to salvage the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Democrats are unlikely to provide $25 billion for Trump's wall absent a much broader immigration deal.
Trump's renewed focus on the border wall comes amid rising pressure to end his administration's policy of separating families that cross the border illegally. The “zero tolerance” policy shift has been roundly criticized by lawmakers in both parties, but Trump has blamed Congress for inaction on immigration.
""Now is the best opportunity ever for Congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration. Get it done, always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security,"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning.
GOP lawmakers are loath to see a government shutdown on their watch just weeks before the midterm elections.
“It’s probably an overwhelming belief in the House and the Senate, especially the Senate, that government shutdowns aren’t good for anybody,"" Shelby said.
The Appropriations Committee began working to pass its Homeland Security bill on Tuesday. Democrats seem unlikely to change course and agree to add more border security money for the president.
""We've got the bill and we're moving forward and I think we're going to get good bipartisan support for it. I think it's a good bill that will keep our borders safe,"" said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), ranking member of the Homeland Security appropriations committee.
On Monday, GOP Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Shelby both tried to explain to Trump that the Senate is merely meeting Mulvaney’s request and has to cut a bipartisan deal with Democrats. The Senate needs 60 votes to pass a spending bill, so Republicans would have to find at least nine Democratic votes.
""We're going to make a down payment on that working together,"" said Capito, chairwoman of Homeland Security spending panel.
But Trump has not been mollified. He raised his voice several times in Monday's meeting with Mulvaney, White House staffers and the senators, insisting he needs the full $25 billion — an unlikely outcome in the narrowly divided Senate.
Shelby said he views $1.6 billion as a floor in negotiations, which could increase if Democrats want to do some horse-trading."

In a private meeting regarding the wall Monday, Trump fumed to senators and his own staff about the $1.6 billion the Senate is planning to send him this fall, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Trump wants the full $25 billion upfront and doesn’t understand why Congress is going to supply him funds in a piecemeal fashion — even though that’s how the spending process typically works. “He’s focused on border security. And like all presidents, he wants it done now. But we’re part of the legislative process, it’s slower and deliberate,"" said Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), who met with Trump.

Is that bad for the GOP? Oh yeah—but let’s not forget that the Trump agenda benefits the GOP, but also his core group of voters who aren’t all Republicans. Trump was able to navigate a checkered path with his base, building off of GOP voters—90 percent of whom voted for him in 2016—and millions of Democrats and Independents who liked his attitude. He was change. He was different. And Hillary looked like the same old movie, only that it would yield more economic pain. A lot of Obama voters flipped for Trump; you don’t bury Clinton the way Trump did in Ohio without help from the other side of the aisle. If Trump is seen as bashing both parties to check off another action item from his agenda, he will be rewarded.
This is an easy item to understand. It’s funding for a wall, a wall that has been unable to be scaled by U.S. Special Forces. Obamacare was a tricky task. There are market factors to contend with, the IRS code due to the new taxes, the regulations, etc. it was a mess. And after nearly a decade of campaigning for its repeal, the GOP failed. There are no such strings attached with a wall. In politics, if you promise a simple thing like building a wall and fail, then you need to do something else. Trump is not like that. He’ll find a way to win.
Trump’s go-to shouldn’t be to put his party, most of which agree with most of his agenda items, in a terrible position so close to the midterms. Trump wants more GOP members elected, but that doesn’t mean Trump won’t do this. He will.
The immigration issue is one the splits the GOP, Democrats know this, which leads us to this discharge petition nonsense. It would have allowed the Left to hold immigration votes without the blessing of the House GOP leadership if they found 218 signatories. This effort was three votes shy, so we’re going to have a vote on two bills that probably won’t pass this week. Who got Democrats so close to success on this push? Well, that would be moderate Republicans."

Trump has repeatedly defended his immigration crackdown, including forcibly separating migrant children from their parents as they arrive at the border. But images of young children housed in metal cages have set off a nationwide outcry that has reached the White House.

Trump described for Republicans how his daughter Ivanka, a senior White House adviser, told him that the images from the border of families being separated were terrible, according to multiple GOP lawmakers who attended the session.
“Can we do anything to stop this?” Trump quoted her saying, according to one lawmaker.
The president’s reaction to his daughter’s remarks, the lawmaker said, was to call it a “tough issue” and push Congress to act: “We need to figure this out,” Trump said. “It’s a sad situation.”
AD
Despite the president’s visit, there was no guarantee that the Republican-led Congress would pass any legislation on immigration, an issue that has exposed deep rifts in the GOP and threatens the party’s control of Congress in November’s midterm elections.
On Wednesday morning, Trump tried again to pin blame on Democrats, writing on Twitter that the country’s immigration laws are “the weakest and worst anywhere in the world, and the Dems will do anything not to change them.”
AD
In another tweet, Trump said he was “working on something” but provided no details.
The Fake News is not mentioning the safety and security of our Country when talking about illegal immigration.

The images from the border have deeply shaken both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, even as Republicans have broadly agreed with the administration’s insistence that Congress hand Trump a legislative fix.
AD
Outside the meeting room, a handful of House Democrats heckled the president as he left the session. The group chanted “Stop separating the children” and “We won’t go away” — although Trump appeared to ignore the protests.
“Quit separating the children, Mr. President,” shouted Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.). “Don’t you have kids? Don’t you have kids?”
Trump and top administration officials are unwilling — at the moment, at least — to unilaterally reverse the separation policy.
The issue has roiled Republicans in the Senate, where lawmakers are drafting narrow legislation to address the issue. GOP senators are coalescing around a framework that would allow families to be detained together and would rework the docket of immigration cases so those families are sent to the front of the line of migrants waiting for a court hearing.
AD

“All of the members of the Republican conference support a plan that keeps families together while their immigration status is determined,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) after a GOP meeting earlier in the day.
McConnell said he hoped the Senate could pass such a bill by the end of the week, although that timeline appeared optimistic.
In the House, there are two rival bills. One is a compromise measure that would provide $25 billion for Trump’s long-sought border wall, offer a pathway to citizenship to young undocumented immigrants and keep migrant families together.
A competing, hard-line bill by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) would not guarantee “dreamers” a path to permanent legal residency and includes controversial enforcement measures such as the mandatory use of a worker verification program.
AD
AD
Adding to the confusion on Capitol Hill, some House Republicans left the evening meeting with the impression that Trump was endorsing the compromise bill.
“The president gave unwavering support of the compromise bill,” said Rep. Jeff Denham ­(R-Calif.). Several other lawmakers said Trump told Republicans that he was “1,000 percent behind you.”
Yet when Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) asked Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) in front of reporters whether he knew which bill Trump was promoting at the meeting — the compromise or the hard-line measure — Sensenbrenner said he did not.
Inside the room, Trump acknowledged that the politics on the border issue were not good and were one reason Republicans needed to act on legislation this week, according to Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.).
AD
“There’s a storm brewing off the coast here, and if we don’t handle this in the next four or five days, this could stick all the way through November,” said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee. “It’s not a political issue. It’s what’s right and what’s wrong.”
AD
Republicans are eager to find a legislative end to the turmoil sparked by the new “zero tolerance” policy at the border — although Trump in recent days has hinted that only a broader bill that included the border wall and other enforcement measures would pass muster.
The Department of Homeland Security has said 2,342 children have been separated from their parents since last month.
AD
As the numbers have mounted, stories of parents in despair and images of children held in chain-link cages have prompted a stream of Republican lawmakers to break with the president and call for him to unilaterally halt the policy while Congress pursues a solution.
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah), along with 12 other Senate Republicans, wrote to the Justice Department calling for a pause on separations until Congress can pass a legislative fix.
AD
In the House, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a prominent conservative leader, introduced another stand-alone bill intended to fix the separation policy.
While Republicans scrambled to craft legislation, it was not clear whether Democrats would support the measures. Sen. Jeff Merkley (Ore.) said Tuesday that he and other Democrats would object to any modification of an existing court settlement that limits the detention of migrant children held by federal authorities.
AD
Democrats, Merkley said, “are not going to try to overturn a court decision that was designed to protect kids.”
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has presented her own plan that would halt family separations. All 49 members of the Senate Democratic Caucus support it. No Republicans have signed on.
The immigration debate has now become consumed by the consequences of the Trump administration’s border policy.
AD
Top GOP leaders have spoken out against the separations, including the head of the party’s national House campaign organization. Polls released Monday by CNN and Quinnipiac University showed that Americans oppose the policy by roughly 2 to 1.
More legal challenges to the administration’s policy arose Tuesday, as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said his state would sue the Trump administration over the family separation practice. The American Civil Liberties Union is already pursuing a nationwide class-action lawsuit in San Diego.
Meanwhile, a second Republican governor, Larry Hogan of Maryland, announced Tuesday that he would not deploy National Guard resources to the border until the Trump administration stops separating migrant children from their parents as part of its criminal prosecution efforts. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) acted similarly Monday.
AD
Two previous presidents — a Republican and a Democrat — operated under the same laws and court settlements, and both generally refrained from separating families at the border. Some Trump administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, have openly cast the separation policy as a deterrent to future illegal immigration.
The two bills set for a House vote this week would both address the status of dreamers, as well as provide funding for the border wall that Trump has long demanded.
Both bills would require the Department of Homeland Security to keep families together, even when a parent is charged with the misdemeanor crime of illegally entering the United States, and would remove a 20-day cap on custody for accompanied children. The bills would also allow DHS to use the $7 billion appropriated in the measures for border technology to house families.
The two bills differ in several ways, however. One takes a more aggressive approach to immigration enforcement — for instance, requiring employers to screen their workers for legal work status using the federal E-Verify database — and does not guarantee dreamers a path to permanent legal residency. The other, which has been written to garner more Republican votes, omits some of the hard-line measures and offers dreamers a path to permanent residency and eventual citizenship."

5713,Outrage Grows over Separating Families at the Border: A Closer Look at the Immigration Controversy',CBN,6/18/2018,,,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2018/june/outrage-grows-over-separating-families-at-the-border-a-closer-look-at-the-immigration-controversy,"WASHINGTON – The battle over children being separated from their parents at the border is spilling over into another week.
At a White House briefing on Monday afternoon, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders introduced Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to speak to reporters about the issue.
Neilsen called on Congress to close the ""loopholes"" in the current law which prevent families from staying together. ""It is not possible, as a matter of law, to detain and remove whole family units who arrive illegally in the United States,"" Nielsen said.
In the tense briefing, Nielsen noted that the US has struggled with a huge spike in immigration at the Mexico border in the last three months. She also says most of the children in these facitlities were sent to the US alone, or with strangers.
""We give them medical care. We take care of them. We have high standards,"" Nielsen said.
When asked how President Donald Trump's evangelical supporters should respond to the immigration crisis, Sanders said any evangelical Christian or church who feels strongly about the issue should ""open up their doors and help facilitate some of these individuals.""
""That's their calling. It's the mission of the church, and they should certainly fulfill that,"" she added. ""If they want to fix the immigration problem, they should call their members of Congress and ask them to join with us to do that.""

First lady Melania Trump also weighed in on the controversy.
""Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,"" said Stephanie Grisham, press secretary and communications director for the first lady.
""She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws but also a country that governs with heart,"" she explained.
The Trump administration has long vowed to crack down on the rate of illegal immigration.
Now, the Department of Justice is pushing back with its new ""zero tolerance policy.""
""If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said.
Under the new policy, every adult that crosses into the US illegally will be criminally prosecuted. That includes asylum seekers who don't enter through the port of entry. With a criminal prosecution, children are then separated from their parents.
According to the Department of Homeland Security, 1,995 have been children separated from their parents in the past six weeks.
'A Life-Changing Experience'
Church elder and father of four Adam Estle has seen the influx of illegal immigrants up close and personal. Estle was the former director of Refugio Phoenix, a school for immigrant children.
That's where he met Victor, a 9-year-old boy from Honduras – and just like that, Estle became a father of five. ""It was a life-changing experience for our family,"" Estle told CBN News.
Estle and his wife became Victor's foster parents. That's when they learned more about him and the circumstances that would make a person travel 1,000 miles into an unknown country.
""For him, in Honduras, it was a combination of fleeing gang violence, fleeing a lack of opportunities for young people and domestic violence was part of the equation,"" Estle explained.
It's a story he says he hears all the time from people crossing illegally into the US.
A Closer Look at the Controversy
The idea of separating children from parents isn't new. In fact, past administrations have separated children from their parents, too. But Estle, who also serves as Director of Field and Constituencies of the National Immigration Forum, says this time is a bit different.
In the past, illegal border crossing was treated as a misdemeanor on the first offense for most individuals; therefore there was no need for a criminal prosecution.
""What's happening now is there is no discretion. Everybody is put in this category,"" Estle explained. That also includes asylum seekers who cross illegally.
""A huge difference that should be problematic for people of faith is that we are separating families who are coming to our border in accordance with US and international law to request asylum,"" Estle continued.
Sessions says there is a reason for that.
""The previous administration released most aliens apprehended at the border who requested asylum into the United States with a document asking them to show up for a hearing at some later date,"" the attorney general claimed. ""Word spread quickly that by asserting a fear of returning to one's home country, one could remain in the United States.""
""The results are just what one would expect. The number of illegal entrants has surged,"" he said.
Department of Homeland Security Kristjen Nielsen also defended the policy on Twitter.
This misreporting by Members, press & advocacy groups must stop. It is irresponsible and unproductive. As I have said many times before, if you are seeking asylum for your family, there is no reason to break the law and illegally cross between ports of entry. — Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen (@SecNielsen) June 17, 2018
""As I have said many times before if you are seeking asylum for your family, there is no reason to break the law and illegally cross between ports of entry,"" she wrote.
Christian Leaders Respond
Christian leaders, including Rev. Samuel Rodriguez and Dr. Russell Moore, sent a letter to the administration hoping they'd find a better solution than breaking up families.
""As evangelical Christians guided by the Bible, one of our core convictions is that God has established the family as the fundamental building block of society. The state should separate families only in the rarest of instances,"" the letter reads.
Matthew Soerens, director of Church Mobilization at World Relief, agreed. ""Central for us at World Relief is our belief that every human being is made in the image of God,"" he explained. ""We find that at the beginning of the Bible and that needs to be the foundation, both as we think about refugees who are fleeing persecutions or immigrants who are seeking a better life in the United States.""
Sen. James Lankford (R-OK), who also serves as a pastor, says he too hopes there is a better way. ""Clearly, God's design is for a family unit,"" Lankford said.
Meanwhile, in an interview with CBN News, evangelist Franklin Graham called the situation ""disgraceful"" and blamed years of inaction from lawmakers.
Sessions says the biblical thing would be for people to obey the law.
""I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13 – to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained the government for his purposes,"" said Sessions.
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is laying the blame at the feet of Democrats.
""I hate the children being taken away. The Democrats have to change their law. That's their law,"" the president said Friday.
Democratic leaders say that isn't so, insisting the separation is a direct result of the no-tolerance policy. ""Let me be clear: That's false. No law requires this action,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA).
In a speech last week, Sessions faulted the Obama administration for failing to prosecute all illegal border crossers.
""The previous administration wouldn't prosecute illegal aliens who entered the country with children. It was de facto open borders,"" Sessions charged.
""The results were unsurprising,"" he continued. ""More and more illegal aliens started showing up at the border with children.""
While true, this admission seems to prove the idea that criminally prosecuting all offenders is, in fact, unique to this administration, thus resulting in an uptick of separated families.
When asked about immigration reform on Monday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded, ""The president isn’t trying to kick the can down the road. He’s trying to work with Congress.""
""He wants to actually fix the problem,"" she said. ""This isn’t just something we can tinker with. We have to fix the entire problem.""
Sanders also said any evangelical or any church that feels strongly should open up their doors if that’s their calling -- the mission of the church.
""If they want to fix the immigration problem,"" she stressed. ""They should call their members of Congress."""
6594,US child migrants: First ladies speak out on Trump separation policy',BBC News,6/18/2018,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44515123,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Zero-tolerance: The US policy dividing families and opinion
The former US First Lady Laura Bush has condemned a controversial policy that splits up families who illegally enter the country at the Mexican border.
Writing in the Washington Post newspaper, she describes the separation of children from their parents as cruel, immoral and heart-breaking.
Her comments follow growing controversy over President Donald Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy.
Earlier Melania Trump made a rare statement expressing concern.
Mrs Trump ""hates to see children separated from their families"", her spokeswoman said.
She repeated her husband's call for ""both sides"" to work on immigration reform as a solution. However, fact-checkers point out that the policy was introduced by Mr Trump's attorney general and does not require congressional action to be stopped.
In a recent six-week period there were nearly 2,000 family separations following a crackdown on illegal border crossings.
Adults who try to cross the border outside of official entry points - many planning to seek asylum - are placed in custody and face criminal prosecution for illegal entry.
As a result, hundreds of children and babies are now being housed in detention centres, including warehouses and converted supermarkets, and kept away from their parents.
What's been said?
Laura Bush, wife of the former Republican President George W Bush and a Texas resident, launched an outspoken attack on the policy.
""This zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart,"" she wrote in the Washington Post.
""Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert.""
Image copyright Reuters/Getty Images Image caption Laura Bush, left, and Melania Trump have both spoken out about the treatment of child migrants
""These images are eerily reminiscent of the Japanese American internment camps of World War Two, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in US history,"" she added.
Earlier Mrs Trump said she ""hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle [Republicans and Democrats in Congress] can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform"".
""We need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart,"" her statement added.
The first ladies' comments come amid growing alarm over the impact of the policy.
On Monday, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called on the US to end what he called its ""unconscionable"" strategy of forced separations.
Earlier Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended her agency's role at the border, saying: ""We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period.""
But she said authorities would remove children if the parent they were travelling with had broken the law.
Who is to blame?
Mr Trump has said a law ""Democrats gave us"" is responsible for the policy, but it is unclear which law he is referring to.
In a tweet on Saturday he urged Democrats to work with Republicans to create new legislation.
However, critics have pointed out that detaining children separately from their parents is the consequence of a policy announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions last month to deter new arrivals.
The significant change, analysts say, is the justice department's decision to prosecute parents if they illegally cross the border, even if it is their first offence. The children are not charged with a crime, which means they cannot be jailed together.

Until this policy was announced, such families were usually subject to civil deportation proceedings, which did not require separation.
What's happening now?
The recent child detentions have resulted in some shelters and foster homes reporting that they are running out of space.
On Sunday, Democratic lawmakers visited shelters and processing facilities in New Jersey and Texas, demanding to see detainees.
""They call it zero-tolerance, but a better name for it is zero-humanity. And there is zero logic to this,"" Sen Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who organised a visit to Casa Padre detention centre in Brownsville, Texas, told the BBC.
""What we saw is this huge warehouse, it was a super centre for Walmart before, now it's a super detention centre. It's holding almost 1,500 kids inside there.""
Vermont congressman Peter Welch said he saw children held ""in chain link cages"" in a processing facility and one shelter ""filled to capacity"".
Meanwhile, officials announced plans to erect tent cities that will hold hundreds more children in the Texas desert where temperatures regularly reach 40C (105F).
Local lawmaker Jose Rodriguez described the plan as ""totally inhumane"" and ""outrageous"", adding: ""It should be condemned by anyone who has a moral sense of responsibility.""
Protesters marched to one such tent city in Tornillo, Texas, on Sunday where hundreds of children were being held separately from their parents.
They chanted ""Families united!"" and ""Free our children now!"", reported NPR.
The policy faces legal challenges, including a federal case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
Is the policy working?
The number of families trying to enter the US overland without documentation is on the rise.
In the first two weeks of the new ""zero-tolerance"" approach, 658 minors - including many babies and toddlers - were separated from the adults that travelled with them, according to US border officials.
In many of the cases, the families have been reunited after the parent was released from detention. However, there are reports of people being kept apart for weeks and even months.
But it is not clear if this new tougher policy will stop the migrants from travelling.
This is because many are fleeing violence and poverty in countries such as Honduras and El Salvador, and staying put is often fraught with dangers."
3668,OPINION: Outrage grows as families are separated. Will Trump change his policy?',CNN - Editorial,6/18/2018,,,https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/18/politics/immigration-trump-congress-family-separation/index.html,"(CNN) The White House's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy and resulting separations of undocumented parents and kids is exploding into the most emotive and politically unpredictable test yet of President Donald Trump's effort to change the character of America.
As outrage grows over traumatic stories of families being torn apart, the big question this week in Washington is how long the controversial practice will be politically sustainable amid a wave of criticism.
A related issue is whether Trump will pay a political price for his false claim that the separations are the fault of Democrats, and not the result of his own administration's change in how undocumented immigrants are treated.
Those questions are likely to be shaped by increasing calls for the administration to consider the morality of separating families. It's not just the usual Democrats who are criticizing the administration -- some prominent Republicans, including first lady Melania Trump and former first lady Laura Bush, religious leaders and influential figures in Trump's conservative evangelical base are also speaking out.
""It's an atrocious policy,"" former White House communications director and Trump ally Anthony Scaramucci said on CNN's ""New Day"" Monday. ""It's inhumane. It's offensive to the average American.""
Still, the President continued to press Democrats to climb down on their opposition to sweeping changes he wants to make to the immigration system.
""Why don't the Democrats give us the votes to fix the world's worst immigration laws? Where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs, including MS-13, coming into our country illegally?"" the President tweeted Monday morning.

Critics argue that the separations are cruel and un-American, using the issue to try to build a tide of distaste against the President and the GOP ahead of midterm elections.
A rare foray into politics by the former first lady significantly cranked up the political heat.
Bush said she appreciated the need to protect the border, but added, ""This zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart.""
""Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert outside of El Paso,"" Bush wrote. ""These images are eerily reminiscent of the Japanese American internment camps of World War II, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in U.S. history.""
Current first lady Melania Trump also expressed concern about the situation, though she did not break with her husband's position that only Congress can stop the separations.
""Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,"" her communications director, Stephanie Grisham, told CNN on Sunday.
Religious leaders, including Cardinal Timothy Dolan and Franklin Graham, a key Trump ally, also faulted the morality of the separations last week.
Will Trump break with base?
Yet despite rising anger, it remains unclear whether the President is willing to risk the personal embarrassment, and potentially a backlash from his base, that a change of course might stir.
Trump's uncanny connection with his loyal voters has been highlighted time and again over immigration and his core promise to introduce a much tougher policy -- even if it has grave humanitarian consequences that critics and outsiders see as immoral.
It would not be surprising if the President feels that any shift in his line under rising media pressure and liberal fury makes it impossible for him to climb down.
It also remains to be see whether this issue -- as heart-wrenching and poignant as it is -- has the power to shatter entrenched political positions that have thwarted a decade-and-a-half of efforts by Congress to reform the immigration system.
Could it prompt Trump voters, for instance, to soften their belief that the border crossings are illegal and those who transgress get the treatment they deserve?
That seems unlikely. But the separations storm is injecting an unpredictable dimension to a critical week ahead in the immigration debate that sources tell CNN will include a meeting between Trump and GOP lawmakers on Tuesday.
The House of Representatives is meanwhile poised to consider a measure that could deal with the fate of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program recipients -- undocumented migrants brought to the US as children -- as well as funding for Trump's border wall and a sweeping overhaul of the system of legal immigration.
Controversy over the separations dominated the political weekend.
Senate candidate and Texas Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke on Sunday branded the separations ""inhumane.""
""I'd like to say it's un-American, but it's happening right now in America. And it is on all of us, not just the Trump administration. This is on all of us,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""
There were clear signs of discomfort at the White House.
Trump's counselor Kellyanne Conway told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that ""nobody likes this policy"" and called on an unnamed official who told The Washington Post that Trump was using it as leverage to come forward and identify himself or herself.
But another key voice in Trump's ear was his former political adviser Steve Bannon, who went on television, in the certain knowledge that the President would end up watching him, and made the case for staying the course despite rising criticism of the White House.
""It's zero tolerance. I don't think you have to justify it. We have a crisis on the southern border,"" Bannon said on ABC's ""This Week.""
Bannon also warned that any bill that guaranteed a path to citizenship for DACA recipients was not just unacceptable but could so irk Trump's base that Republicans could lose 50 seats in the House in November.
""All (Trump has) got to do is listen to his own inner voice,"" Bannon said.
House battle awaits
The House could vote as early as this week on a plan that would address family separations although the legislation would do little to change the underlying practice that has been implemented under the Trump administration.
The compromise bill reverses a court settlement and would now allow children to be held with their parents indefinitely if they are in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security.
But it doesn't do anything to stop the Trump administration from continuing its current practice of prosecuting parents who cross the border without documentation in the criminal justice system. If the administration continues that practice, parents and children would still be separated.
""That's an issue of great concern to me. And we're still looking for ways to do more to keep families together in this legislation,"" Florida Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a key negotiator in the GOP's compromise legislation, told reporters last week.
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said last week that the administration's practice could be ""changed just like that"" as she snapped her fingers.
The idea that Congress could fix the policy is strewn with obstacles.
To start with, Trump has kept lawmakers guessing about whether he would sign any bill. On Friday, he told Fox News that he had no intention of doing so. But roughly nine hours later -- after a day of speculation and confusion -- the White House issue a statement saying that Trump supported two Republican bills on the issue.
Three sources told CNN that Trump will meet House Republicans at the Capitol on Tuesday to discuss next steps on immigration, a gathering that could seal the fate of the House's hard-fought compromise immigration bill.
Conservatives look to Trump for political cover
If Trump makes a strong endorsement, it could be enough to convince members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus to back the bill. With Trump as a shield against conservative radio, the party base and hard-right immigration groups, conservatives will have a rationale to back a bill that some have expressed concerns would not go far enough to secure the border.
But, if he's lukewarm or non-committal, the future of the House's compromise immigration bill would likely be sunk.
""At the end of the day, his voice on immigration probably carries more weight in the Republican conference than any other voice. And so you have to pay attention to that,"" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters Friday.
Democrats have already said that they oppose the bill, meaning that it's up to Republicans and them alone to get it across the finish line.
Senators are only just beginning to wrestle with the separations.
After spending a week already earlier in the year trying and failing to fix the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, there is little appetite among Republican leaders for a new immigration debate before the midterms.
That could change, however, if the House passes a bill and pressure mounts from the White House for a Senate debate."

The White House on Friday evening walked back Donald Trump’s criticism of a House GOP bill shielding Dreamers from deportation, saying in a statement that the president would sign the legislation.
After a daylong, dizzying back-and-forth over Trump’s position, White House spokesman Raj Shah said Trump misunderstood a question on “Fox & Friends” Friday morning when he argued he would not sign a “moderate” immigration proposal scheduled for a vote next week.

Many on Capitol Hill — and even in the White House — believed Trump was referring to immigration legislation released Thursday, the product of weeks of negotiations between centrist Republicans, conservatives and GOP leaders. But Shah argued that Trump was instead knocking a proposal backed by moderates and Democrats that would codify the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program without any significant immigration crackdown.
“The President fully supports both the Goodlatte bill and the House leadership bill,"" Shah said, referring to a conservative DACA plan that's expected to fail next week, as well as the compromise bill released Thursday.
Trump, he added, ""would sign either.""
Trump’s apparent embrace of the bill is a boon to House leaders hoping to pass the text next week. Conservatives need the president to give them cover to vote for a bill that includes a pathway to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.
The vote is still expected to fall short because of opposition from immigration hardliners and some GOP centrists. But Trump's apparent criticism Friday morning would have led to an embarrassing spectacle in which only a few dozen lawmakers supported the plan, some leadership sources speculated.
Trump's earlier comments Friday might still spook skittish lawmakers, making passage difficult. The president has big-footed senior White House officials before, catching them off-guard and reversing official White House positions without so much as a warning. Republicans will spend all next week fretting about a repeat of such a situation.
The White House's support of the bill isn't entirely surprising. The new House proposal mirrors Trump's own framework to increase security, curb legal immigration and shield Dreamers from deportation. Not only that, top White House officials, including immigration hawk Stephen Miller, were working behind the scenes to whip support for the document. And the White House had drafted a policy statement saying the president would sign the bill.
But Trump heard conservative criticism of the proposal on TV, according to senior Republicans, and swatted the proposal down Friday morning.
“I’m looking at both of them,” Trump told “Fox & Friends” in an interview Friday morning from the White House lawn. “I certainly wouldn’t sign the more moderate one.”

Hours later, the president added to the confusion with a tweet that demanded provisions that the compromise bill seemingly includes. “Any Immigration Bill MUST HAVE full funding for the Wall, end Catch & Release, Visa Lottery and Chain, and go to Merit Based Immigration. Go for it!“ he wrote.
Before Shah's clarification, the president's statement appeared to have dealt a fatal blow to the bill. GOP leaders knew few Republicans would back a bill Trump rejected, so they delayed a planned vote-counting session slated for Friday.
House Majority Whip Steve Scalise even threatened to withdraw his support for the package. His office told Breitbart that the Louisiana Republican, who wants to be speaker someday, would not whip support for any immigration bill the president opposed.
After the morning interview, GOP leaders and White House aides scrambled to get Trump back on message. And early on, senior Republicans predicted that Trump would not only walk back his comments but fully endorse the compromise bill. His comments on TV, they said, left him enough wiggle room to say he was discussing a Democratic proposal that did not include his wall.
That's exactly what the White House did — it just took more than eight hours.
Before the White House clarification, however, some conservatives applauded the president.
""He's correctly judging the American people's opinion on this subject; we're not there yet,"" said Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.). Asked what more he needed in the compromise bill, Perry seemed aghast: ""Enforcement! Enforcement! We can't keep on having these half-measures that don't fix the problem.""
Trump's initial comments came after Ryan and other members of the House leadership team told reporters that they’d described their bill to the president and he was “excited” about it. Ryan has stressed to reporters that he has been working ""hand in glove"" with the administration in writing the bill.
Indeed, senior White House policy adviser Miller came to Capitol Hill earlier this week to encourage wary conservatives fearful of backlash from the base to support the plan. And GOP leaders in meetings talked about the possibility of Trump as well as the White House helping them whip support.
Had the White House not reversed Trump's position, GOP leaders would have found themselves backed into a corner, having to ask Republicans to vote against their own president on a controversial topic that divides the party most.
Leaders told worried Republicans to keep calm on Friday and that a statement clearing things up would eventually follow.
""We're waiting for some clarification on what that really means,"" said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.). ""We don't know.""
Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), who helped craft the compromise bill, said he was told that Trump ""will sign it.""
""I think once he has a chance to digest it, he will sign it,"" Diaz-Balart said, though he declined to say who told him that, and cautioned that it would have to be verified with the White House. Diaz-Balart admitted Republicans ""have a big problem"" if Congress backs a compromise package and he vetoes it. ""We need the president to look at it, and look at in detail... But I am hoping we can get his support.""
Trump's initial remarks seemed to be a rebuke to Ryan and his team, who’ve spent hours huddled in the speaker’s office trying to hash out an immigration bill that moderate Republicans from districts with big Latino populations and conservatives could back. Both sides have given ground in the talks: Moderates begrudgingly accepted strict enforcement measures, while conservatives for the first time were open to providing citizenship for Dreamers.
What’s more, the GOP plan reflected Trump’s own “four pillars” proposal that includes a pathway to citizenship, an end to the diversity visa lottery program, curbs on family migration and $25 billion for the border wall. It would also increase border security and interior enforcement.
Trump's rejection of the bill would have been a huge blow to moderate Republicans who this spring forced the immigration matter to the forefront. Banding with Democrats, they threatened to take over the floor, circumvent their own party and pass legislation to shield Dreamers from deportation — unless Republicans could agree on their own plan to address the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
That set off the intense negotiating sessions that led to the compromise bill released Thursday.

Breaking an hours-long silence, White House spokesman Raj Shah said Mr. Trump is backing both the GOP leaders’ bill and a more enforcement-heavy version from conservatives. Both are expected to be put up for votes next week on the House floor.
“The president fully supports both the Goodlatte bill and the House leadership bill,” Mr. Shah said. “In this morning’s interview, he was commenting on the discharge petition in the House, and not the new package. He would sign either the Goodlatte or the leadership bills.”
Mr. Trump threw the House GOP into turmoil early Friday morning when, in an interview with Fox News, he rejected the “moderate” bill.
Steve Doocy, the Fox interviewer, asked about both bills, referring to one as the Goodlatte bill, sponsored by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, and the other as a more “moderate” bill.
“I’m looking at both of them. I certainly wouldn’t sign the more moderate one,” Mr. Trump replied.
Compounding matters, Mr. Trump had a chance to clean up the mess in an afternoon tweet but failed to do so, instead laying out his principles he wanted to see.
The bizarre twist is that the GOP leaders’ legislation perfectly matches Mr. Trump’s “four pillar” principles, granting legal status to perhaps 2 million illegal immigrants, funding his border wall, ending the visa lottery and curtailing the chain of family migration.
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan had said they wrote the bill “hand-in-glove” with the administration.
Conservatives said Friday they expected Mr. Trump to issue a new statement cleaning up his remark.
Yet one source from a group that supports an immigration crackdown said the comment wasn’t a mistake and Mr. Trump did have misgivings.
Conservative Republicans are reluctant to tackle any bill that grants citizenship rights to illegal immigrants without Mr. Trump on board, fearing a massive backlash from conservative activists. They’re counting on Mr. Trump to provide political cover against those who will call the bill a blanket amnesty.

4766,House GOP Leadership Gets White House Support on Immigration Vote Plan',Wall Street Journal - News,6/14/2018,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-gop-leadership-reaches-deal-to-hold-immigration-votes-1528925583,"WASHINGTON—House Republican leadership indicated on Wednesday they had White House support on their plan to put two immigration bills forward, but it was unclear if that would be enough for a bill to pass in Congress.
In a deal struck with centrists and conservative members of the conference, House Speaker Paul Ryan said he would hold votes next week on legislation that will protect young immigrants brought to the U.S. as minors and living in the U.S. without authorization, as well as increase funding for border security.

4683,"Paul Ryan Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Want Kids Split From Their Parents, But He Won\xe2\x80\x99t Blame Trump For It'",HuffPost,6/14/2018,,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-family-separations_us_5b229e9de4b07cb1712c67cd,"President Donald Trump’s policies have separated more than 1,000 immigrant children from their parents at the border. But according to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), it’s not Trump’s fault.
“This is because of a court ruling,” Ryan said Thursday during a press conference. He went on to repeat the claim three times.
The speaker said he was not comfortable with family separations occurring at the border and that “we don’t want kids to be separated from their parents.” While he condemned the result, he brushed off Trump’s role in the policy his administration instituted, instead blaming it on a 1997 court settlement that no other president has interpreted to necessitate splitting up families en masse.
Ryan said that the solution is a legislative change to address the court decision, which a spokeswoman confirmed was a reference to the 1997 Flores settlement, which bars the government from detaining children for long periods, including with their parents. He didn’t get into details on what that would mean. But the proposal pushed by the White House isn’t to let kids live outside detention rather than split them from their parents: It’s to keep them all locked up together, potentially for months or even years.
“What’s happening at the border and the separation of parents and their children is because of a court ruling,” Ryan said. “That’s why I think legislation is necessary.”
House Republicans are working on a compromise immigration bill to be considered next week, along with a restrictionist-favored bill. A measure to limit family separation at the border is expected to be part of that legislation, likely in the form of changes to address the Flores settlement. The White House also supports policies to speed up removal of unauthorized immigrant families and kids.
The current family separation policy relates to the Flores settlement only in the sense that the Trump administration would rather split up families than allow them to be released from detention while their cases go through the courts.
In reality, family separations are due to the Trump administration’s new zero tolerance policy for illegal entry, which necessitates locking up parents separately so they can be criminally prosecuted. Previously, officials often used their discretion to put families detained at the border in immigration proceedings rather than split them up.
When a reporter pointed out the separations were a result of the administration’s zero tolerance policy, Ryan replied that “there’s also a court ruling involved” and called for a legislative fix.
Trump has blamed the policy on a “horrible law” pushed by Democrats ― there is no such law ― and called for a legislative fix.
Child welfare experts say family separations are highly damaging for children, some of whom have already undergone trauma in their native country or during their journey to the U.S. But family immigrant detention is not considered a healthy place for children, either, and can have long-term effects on a child’s development.
Immigrant rights activists and Democrats fought family immigrant detention under President Barack Obama and do not consider it a viable alternative to splitting up parents and kids.
“That also has tremendous traumatic impact on the family unit,” Wendy Young, the president of the immigrant child protection group Kids in Need of Defense, said Thursday on a call with reporters. “Family separation is obviously the next step backwards and is even harsher than that, but we do not support family detention as the solution.”"
6899,House Republicans look to unite party on plan for immigration reform',Washington Times,6/14/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jun/13/house-republicans-look-to-unite-party-on-plan-for-/,"Republicans tried to build support Wednesday for their compromise immigration plan, saying they’ve come up with something that can unite the GOP and get President Trump’s signature.
Preparing for the first major House immigration floor debate in eight years, Speaker Paul D. Ryan was hashing out final details on the compromise, which he will put up for votes next week.
“This has a chance of going into law,” Mr. Ryan said after a party caucus meeting Wednesday.
According to a draft outline, the plan the GOP is working on would allow “Dreamers,” those who illegally crossed into the U.S. as children, to get in line for citizenship.
The plan would also authorize and fund Mr. Trump’s border wall, raise the burden of proof on asylum claims, allow faster deportation of some illegal immigrants including children, limit the chain of family migration and eliminate the diversity visa lottery that doles out 55,000 immigration passes each year.
And the bill would explicitly prevent separation of children from their parents at the border, according to the draft.
Still to be decided is the size and details of the pathway to citizenship. One option would only cover Dreamers, while another option would cover children whose parents came on temporary legal visas.
The White House signaled its support for the plan, though many rank-and-file Republicans were waiting to see the final bill.
Rep. Mark Meadows, the head of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said the president could sway members.
“Could he move 100 people because he says he likes it? The answer is ‘No,’” Mr. Meadows said. “Can he move a dozen or so? The answer is ‘Yes.’ “
GOP leaders dodged a bullet this week after a renegade group of moderate Republicans failed to muster enough support for a petition drive that would have forced voted on a series of bills, including a Democrat-backed option with a more generous amnesty and far less enforcement.
Instead, the GOP will allow two votes: one on the compromise still being worked out, and the other on an enforcement-heavy bill authored by House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte.
Mr. Goodlatte’s bill would write President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program into law, granting Dreamers a firmer legal footing but without the new pathway to citizenship that many have demanded.
That bill is not expected to win a majority.
Instead, the attention is on the compromise, which Mr. Ryan says matches the four pillars of reform Mr. Trump laid out earlier this year.
“We’ve been working hand-in-glove with the administration on this, to make sure that we’re bringing a bill that represents the president’s four pillars so that we can come together, have the votes that everybody’s looking for,” he said.
Mr. Trump’s “four pillars” blueprint called for a pathway to citizenship for up to 1.8 million illegal immigrants, combined with his border wall, elimination of the visa lottery and limits to the number of family members a legal immigrant could sponsor.
Rep. Scott Perry, Pennsylvania Republican and member of the Freedom Caucus, said the “devil is in the details” of the compromise — in particular when it comes to security. “We all just need to take a breath and see what we’ve got before we get too excited about it one way or the other,” Mr. Perry said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Since the government acknowledged last month that the Trump administration had lost track of nearly 1,500 immigrant children, the debate over what that means and who is to blame has roiled Twitter. Here’s a look at the partisan claims and a reality check behind the latest immigration fight:
THE 2014 PHOTOS
—“Speechless. This is not who we are as a nation.” — Democrat Antonio Villaraigosa, former Los Angeles mayor now running for governor, referring in a tweet Sunday to photos showing young-looking immigrants in steel cages.
ADVERTISEMENT
—“This is happening right now, and the only debate that matters is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible.” — Jon Favreau, who was speechwriter for President Barack Obama, referring Sunday to the same photos.
THE FACTS: The photos, taken by The Associated Press, were from 2014, during the Obama administration, but were presented by liberal activists as if they showed the effects of Trump’s immigration policy now. Villaraigosa, Favreau and some others deleted their tweets when the mistake was pointed out.
They had linked to a June 2014 online story by The Arizona Republic titled “First peek: Immigrant children flood detention center.” The story featured photos taken by AP’s Ross D. Franklin at a center run by the Customs and Border Protection Agency in Nogales, Arizona. One photo shows two unidentified female detainees sleeping in a holding cell. The caption refers to U.S. efforts to process 47,000 unaccompanied children at the Nogales center and another one in Brownsville, Texas.
Many tweets used the hashtag “WhereAreOurChildren,” which grew out of testimony in April by a federal official that the U.S. government had lost track of nearly 1,500 unaccompanied minor children it placed with adult sponsors in the U.S.
Trump tweeted: “Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama’s term showing children from the Border in steel cages. They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires.”
He is right about the misrepresentation, though it’s not clear that many prominent Democrats jumped on this particular Twitter bandwagon.
___
THE ‘LOST’ CHILDREN
—“1500 innocent children ripped from their mothers’ arms at our border. Lost in Trump’s “system”. Give us your tired, your poor, your huddle masses yearning to breathe free — and we will torture them for wanting a better life. From Shining City to Evil Empire in under 500 days.” — tweet Sunday by actor Jim Carrey.
—“What is more shameful than forcibly separating, in America, parents from infant children at the border? And then, losing track of those children?” — tweet Friday by Preet Bharara, fired by Trump as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.
THE FACTS: The nearly 1,500 children in question arrived at the border without their parents and were not forced from them by U.S. authorities. Critics are conflating those children with others, who came to the border with their parents, only to be separated there.
To call the children lost, as many have, is misleading. It’s more accurate to say the government lost track of them, as Bharara put it.
An official from the Health and Human Services Department told a congressional hearing last month that his department placed follow-up phone calls from October to December to U.S. households that were sponsoring the minors after they came to the border without their parents. They reached 86 percent of the children or sponsors, determining 6,075 remained with their sponsors, 28 had run away, five had been removed from the U.S. and 52 relocated to live with someone else.
The department could not verify the whereabouts of 1,475. In some of many cases, sponsors simply didn’t respond to the follow-up phone call, not surprising because many are in the U.S. illegally and reluctant to speak to authorities. HHS decided 792 of those cases merited more attention and referred them to the National Call Center.
It’s not highly unusual to fail to keep track of many minors who came unaccompanied to the border.
During the last year of the Obama administration, HHS was able to locate 85 percent of the minors or their sponsors, according to an inspector general’s report. The Trump administration slightly exceeded that success rate in the last three months of 2017, even as it is accused of losing children.

ZERO TOLERANCE
—TRUMP: “Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S.” — tweet Saturday.
THE FACTS: No law mandates that parents must be separated from their children at the border, and it’s not a policy Democrats have pushed or can change alone as the minority in Congress. The policy comes from Trump’s own administration, which has decided to enforce criminal charges against people crossing the border illegally with few or no previous offenses. Under U.S. protocol, if parents are jailed, their children would be separated from them.
Discussing the zero-tolerance policy recently, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said: “If we do our duty and prosecute those cases, then children inevitably for a period of time might be in different conditions.”
A Customs and Border Protection official told lawmakers last week that 658 children had been separated from their parents at the border from May 6 to May 19, after border agents began referring every illegal entry to criminal prosecutors. This is in addition to hundreds more who were estimated to have been removed from their parents at the border since October.
A 2008 law, passed unanimously by Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush, says children traveling alone from countries other than Mexico or Canada must be released in the “least restrictive setting” — often to family or a government-run shelter — while their cases slowly wind through immigration court. The law came amid concerns about border control officials and their treatment of children.

3284,The real immigration crisis isn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cmissing\xe2\x80\x9d children. It\xe2\x80\x99s family separations.',Vox,5/31/2018,,,https://www.vox.com/2018/5/30/17405992/family-separations-missing-migrant-children,"Thousands of Twitter users spent the weekend asking #WhereAreTheChildren?
The viral hashtag sprang up in response to a now widely shared New York Times article noting that the federal government had been unable to make contact with 1,475 unaccompanied minors awaiting deportation hearings.
First things first: Despite reports to the contrary, those children are not “missing” or “misplaced.”
Immigration experts point out that these children are not in government custody, nor are they supposed to be. Instead, this is a population of minors who arrived at the US border unaccompanied by parents or adults, were then detained by immigration authorities, and then were largely released into the care of parents and other close relatives.
The government recently tried to reach about 7,600 of these children with a single phone call each. In 1,475 cases, those phone calls went unanswered — the so-called “missing.”
But as Diane Eikenberry, associate director of policy at the National Immigrant Justice Center, puts it, “If you can’t reach somebody after one phone call, you usually would not describe that person as missing.” (You can read a more in-depth interview on the “missing” children here.)
Immigration advocates like Eikenberry aren’t spending a lot of time worried about #WhereAreTheChildren. Instead, they say the real crisis is the Trump administration’s new policy of separating undocumented families apprehended at the US border — a policy that may have gotten conflated with the “missing” children story that went viral this weekend.
Both stories raised concerns about the same issue: how the United States treats children who enter the country without legal status. But advocates worry significantly more about the new policy of separation than the so-called “missing” children. They fear that this policy — which has already led to more than 600 children being separated from their parents — will create traumatic situations for families and overwhelm the very immigration infrastructure put in place to protect these minors.
The real crisis advocates worry about: the separation of migrant families at the border
The Trump administration announced on May 7 that it would begin separating all families apprehended at the border, trying to cross into the United States without documentation.
My colleague Dara Lind has a helpful rundown of how this policy came about:
An increasing share of border crossers seeking asylum come as “family units”: one or more adults with one or more children. (The Trump administration refers to them as “purported ‘family units’” to underline the fact that they could be lying about their family relationship.) And it’s much harder for the government to detain whole immigrant families than it is for them to detain adults. Federal court rulings have set strict standards on the conditions under which families can be detained. Under the Obama administration, courts ruled that they couldn’t be kept in detention for more than 20 days. The Trump administration’s solution, now codified in policy, is to stop treating them as families: to detain the parents as adults and place the children in the custody of Health and Human Services as “unaccompanied minors.” In some cases, according to immigration lawyers, parents separated from their children have begged to withdraw their asylum applications — on the logic that it would be easier for them to reunify their families in their home countries.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has described this as a “zero tolerance” policy. “If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple,” he said in a statement earlier this month.
When pressed by NPR on whether this policy was “cruel and heartless,” White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told NPR, “The children will be taken care of — put into foster care or whatever.”
For families facing the prospect of children in “foster care or whatever,” the reality can be devastating. Lomi Kriel, a reporter for the Houston Chronicle, recently wrote about a 28-year-old father who was separated from his 18-month-old son last summer, after the pair were apprehended at the southern border, crossing without documentation:
Esteban Pastor hoped U.S. Border Patrol agents would free him and his 18-month-old son after they were arrested for crossing the southern border illegally last summer. He had mortgaged his land in Guatemala to fund his sick toddler’s hospital stay, and needed to work in the United States to pay off the loan. Instead agents imprisoned the 28-year-old in July for coming back into the country after having been deported, a felony. They placed the toddler in a federal shelter, though where, Pastor didn’t know. Three months later, in October, the father was deported — alone. His child, he said agents told him, was “somewhere in Texas.” “I cried. I begged,” he said. “No one could tell me anything.”
Hundreds of these situations are playing out now for families that tried to cross into the United States. The Trump administration estimates that it has apprehended 638 adults trying to cross into the country without documentation since the new separation policy began. They were traveling with a total of 658 children.
This is beyond other family separations that occurred — perhaps as many as 700 of them, according to New York Times reporting — before the Trump administration announced this official change in policy.
And keep in mind that these individuals have not been convicted of crimes. Many are arriving in the United States planning to seek asylum from horrific violence in Central America, particularly Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The United Nations estimates that the number of refugees seeking asylum from these places has increased sixteenfold since 2011.
“We’re a bit in panic mode”
Immigration advocates are worried about what these separations will mean for the minors going forward in the United States. There is the obvious trauma of losing contact with a parent, especially for the youngest children.
“The children we talk to in government custody, their number one concern is often how quickly they can get to the person they see as their family figure,” Eikenberry says. “For young kids, that is all they can think about.”
Those facilities can be a tough place for children to live. “These facilities do have a little bit of an education program, but it’s still federal detention,” says Jennifer Podkul, director of policy at Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a nonprofit based in Washington, DC, that represents unaccompanied minors in court. “Even low-security facilities have barbed-wire fences around them, and communication with those outside is monitored. Everybody knows that detention is not good for kids.”
Most of these minors are likely to be released from detention into the care of a close relative. This is the goal in the case of children who arrive unaccompanied as well as those separated from their family (although with those recently separated from their family, it may be more challenging as their parent is in government custody).
The government agency that oversees this program estimates that, on average, unaccompanied children spend 51 days in these facilities — and in 2017, 93 percent were released into the care of guardians, largely parents and other close family members.
But even then, the separation of families at the border could mean that this group of children has a worse chance at making a case for asylum in the United States.
Advocates worry about two distinct hurdles. First, the separation policy creates a larger number of unaccompanied minors in the United States — which means a bigger pool of children vying for limited attorney services from the pro bono firms that typically take their cases.
KIND, where Podkul works, is one of those organizations — and it’s already worried about how it will handle the uptick in minors who are facing deportation hearings on their own.
“We’re a bit in panic mode,” says Podkul. “There are very limited organizations that have this specialty and provide these services; less than half of children get representation, and now they’ve just added 600-plus kids.”
That could have real effects for children, as those who receive representation are significantly more likely to win in deportation hearings. One 2014 study found that unaccompanied minors with representation have a 73 percent chance of winning their case, compared to just 15 percent for those without an attorney.
What’s more, Podkul says that children are less able to defend themselves against deportation hearings when they aren’t able to contact their parents.
The parents, for example, likely know better why they believe their children ought to be given asylum in the United States. They’re more likely to be carrying the paperwork to make that case too.
“These cases get a lot harder when these kids are separated from an adult,” says Podkul. “If a child has traveled with an adult, the parent often knows the full story of why they’re seeking asylum. They have documents like birth certificates or police reports. But once these kids are separated, they’ve lost communication. It makes our job a lot harder.”
Why the 1,500 “missing” children aren’t a top concern for immigration advocates
On April 28, Steven Wagner testified before a Senate subcommittee on homeland security. Wagner runs the Administration for Children and Families, a federal agency that oversees the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).
ORR is responsible for oversight of unaccompanied minors awaiting a court hearing on their immigration status, a process that can take years. And while these minors do spend some time in government-run shelters and facilities after their apprehension, ORR typically attempts to place most children with a family member who agrees to take custody.
In 2017, ORR estimated that these children spent an average of 51 days in a government facility before being released to outside custody (in 2018, that number appears to have risen to 57). Of the 93 percent of kids in detention who were ultimately released to a guardian outside of the government, about half (49 percent) went to their parents, 41 percent to another close relative, and an additional 10 percent to “other-than-close relatives or non-relatives.”
“There is an actual statutory mandate that these children are supposed to be placed into the least restrictive setting,” Eikenberry says. “In almost every case, this is with a family caregiver, not in some sort of detention.”
In late 2014, ORR began to place phone calls to those family caregivers 30 days after the child is placed in the new home. This is what Wagner was describing when he told Congress about what his agency learned from those phone calls in late 2017. Here’s the relevant part of his testimony:
From October to December 2017, ORR attempted to reach 7,635 UAC and their sponsors. Of this number, ORR reached and received agreement to participate in the safety and well-being call from approximately 86 percent of sponsors. From these calls, ORR learned that 6,075 UAC remained with their sponsors. Twenty-eight UAC had run away, five had been removed from the United States, and 52 had relocated to live with a non-sponsor. ORR was unable to determine with certainty the whereabouts of 1,475 UAC.
In other words: 1,475 of 7,635 phone calls to the sponsors of unaccompanied children were not picked up. Immigration advocates don’t find this figure especially concerning. They say there are plenty of reasons why families might miss a phone call, ranging from boring logistics to more widespread fears of the federal government.
“A lot of these families may have a pay-as-you-go phone number,” says Podkul at KIND. “I definitely had times when I couldn’t get ahold of a client for weeks. [There is also] a climate of fear. Parents and families that are undocumented might be scared to pick up the phone.”
Immigration advocates are pretty torn on how aggressively the government should track unaccompanied minors — whether it’s actually a problem that there isn’t more than a phone call made to ascertain this population’s whereabouts.
On the one hand, immigration advocates want to make sure that unaccompanied minors are getting the services and support that they need. Podkul, for example, thinks it’s important to ensure that these children have access to representation as they move through court proceedings on their immigration status.
At the same time, advocates worry about aggressive monitoring of this same population, particularly if the United States wants to use that information as a means to surveil unaccompanied minors in a way to obtain information that could be used against them in deportation hearings.
“It worries me because of all the other ways we see the Trump administration enforcing these types of laws and policies; it serves pretty restrictive ends,” Eikenberry says. “If not done with a more holistic goal of keeping these kids safe and healthy, I definitely fear that lens being turned on children.”"
3823,Remember those brutal immigrant detention centers liberals tried to pin on Trump? It was all Obama',Washington Examiner,5/31/2018,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/remember-those-brutal-immigrant-detention-centers-liberals-tried-to-pin-on-trump-it-was-all-obama,"Liberals and even ostensibly objective journalists are experts at getting themselves outraged. But only if they think that an abuse is occurring under President Trump.
Over Memorial Day Weekend, former Obama White House speechwriter Jon Favreau attempted to pin the blame of the harsh and brutal conditions for children and families at immigrant detention centers on President Trump.
Favreau tweeted on Sunday, ""Look at these pictures. This is happening right now, and the only debate that matters is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible.""
He then linked to an article in AZcentral titled, ""First glimpse of immigrant children at holding facility."" The picture accompanying the piece looks quite terrible, with kids in the sort of cages you might see in a dog kennel.
But here's the problem: The article and photo are from 2014, when Favreau's boss, Barack Obama, was president, and had been president for five to six years.
The Daily Caller called Favreau out on this, and he has since deleted the tweet. However, that didn't stop others from making their move to gin up outrage to elevate their own platforms.
I saw this photo floating around and didn’t know if it was real.
It is.
Children of immigrants are being held in cages, like dogs, at ICE detention centers, sleeping on the floor. It’s an abomination.

The US Govt is holding migrant children in small cages like they are animals--just as 45 describes them.

This is monstrous. We are all complicit. https://t.co/eObKaKrAJq — Yes, You're Racist (@YesYoureRacist) May 27, 2018
This level of outrage followed a New York Times report that the Department of Health and Human Services lost nearly 1,500 immigrant children. They then had to walk that claim back saying that these children weren't ""lost,"" but that many of their adult sponsors did not respond to the federal agency.
The lesson that can be learned from this is that Democrats are just as blindly apologetic and complicit in letting the Obama administration mete out the same exact treatment toward immigrant families that they criticize now that Trump is president. They pretend to care about the issue of immigration in the age of Trump, but they were completely silent when their allies were running the show.
And yes, Republicans have, by and large, excused reprehensible and borderline racist behavior coming from President Trump simply because they stand to benefit from his policies. But, at the same time, you've never seen this many Republicans stand up and call out a Republican president for his comments and policies when they believed he's in the wrong. Any moral objections Democrats had to Obama while he was in office were quite vigorously suppressed.
So what's the best strategy to avoid this faux outrage in the future? Start by caring more about your country than your party."
2432,Trump calls for Democrats to end \xe2\x80\x98horrible law\xe2\x80\x99 that he says separates children from parents at border',Fox News (Online),5/27/2018,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/05/26/trump-calls-for-democrats-to-end-horrible-law-that-says-separates-children-from-parents-at-border.html,"President Trump on Saturday called on Democrats to end a “horrible law” that he says separates children from their parents when they cross the border -- and also accused them of “protecting MS-13 thugs.”
“Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there [sic] parents once they cross the Border into the U.S.” he tweeted.
Trump made the remarks amid a pushback from Democrats and activists at a “zero tolerance” policy enforced by the Justice Department. That policy refers all illegal border crossings for prosecution, including illegal immigrants with children.
Those parents are housed at adult detention centers, and consequently their children are separated from them, registered as “unaccompanied minors” and handed to the Department of Health and Human Services.
Trump has blamed Democrats for the separation of children from their parents before. Last week he told Homeland Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen that the breaking up of families occurred because of “bad laws that the Democrats gave us.”
The Associated Press reported that he appeared to be referring to a 2008 law to combat child trafficking -- a bipartisan law authored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., but signed into law by Republican President George W. Bush.
While the law says nothing about separating families, it does say that children travelling alone from countries other than Mexico and Canada must be released in the “least restrictive setting” -- namely a family or shelter.
The Justice Department’s zero-tolerance policy, designed to deter prospective illegal immigrants, means that illegal immigrants are no longer released with their children into the U.S. and consequently that their children are separated from them.
“If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple,” Sessions said earlier this month. “If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you. And that child may be separated from you, as required by law.”
SESSIONS SAYS ALL ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED; CHILDREN MAY BE SEPARATED FROM PARENTS
But Trump called on Democratic lawmakers to end the practice, apparently as part of a deal that includes the ending of so-called “catch and release” whereby illegal immigrants are released into America while they wait for their court hearing. He also said that the diversity lottery visa and so-called chain migration -- where immigrants can sponsor family members for visas -- must end.
“Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL!” he tweeted.
He also returned to accusing Democrats of “protecting” MS-13 gang members. He has said repeatedly that their opposition to strong border policies, as well as the promotion of “sanctuary policies” in states like California and New York, mean criminal gang members get released back into communities.
“Democrats are protecting MS-13 thugs,” he tweeted.
Trump was criticized by Democrats for describing MS-13 members as “animals.” This week he accused Democrats of “trying to defend” them, noting that he was criticized for his remarks by Democratic leaders Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-NY.

Before the Trump administration, the office handled children who crossed the border alone.
White House chief of staff John Kelly, who called the harsh new policy a “technique” and a “tough deterrent,” explained earlier this month to NPR: “They’ll be sent to foster care — or whatever. But the big point is they elected to come illegally into the United States.”

In their latest “seven-figure project” to promote amnesty for illegal aliens, the Koch brothers are thanking Democrats and their open borders agenda in mailers.
The Koch mailers, revealed by NPR, thank Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-CA), Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-CA), Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), Rep. Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), and Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) for their push for open borders and amnesty for illegal aliens.
The mailer campaign by the Koch brothers also thanks a number of Republicans for supporting their agenda of open borders and amnesty.
As Breitbart News has chronicled, the Koch brothers have attempted to shape the Republican Congressional agenda ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.
Despite midterm voters repeatedly saying they want less immigration to the U.S., the Koch brothers have pushed GOP lawmakers to endorse amnesty for illegal aliens and have set out on a campaign opposing Trump’s popular plan to cut legal immigration levels.

Currently, the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million legal and illegal immigrants every year, with more than 70 percent coming to the country through chain migration. In the next 20 years, the current U.S. legal immigration system is on track to import roughly 15 million new foreign-born voters. Between seven and eight million of those foreign-born voters will arrive in the U.S. through chain migration.
The Koch brothers have said they oppose wage-boosting cuts to legal immigration levels, Breitbart News reported.
The slightly tightened labor market — a result of Trump’s increased border security and economic nationalist vision, which is opposed by the Koch brothers — has secured high-paying industry jobs for American teens, as well as history-making wage growth for American workers in the construction industry, the garment industry, for workers employed at small businesses, black Americans, and restaurant workers."

LIBRE is an outreach of the Koch network that focuses on a number of issues for the Hispanic community.

Not all the ads are directed at Democrats. Six GOP House lawmakers and three Republican senators will receive praise from the group, NPR reports.
The LIBRE network told NPR that the project was part of a ""seven-figure"" spending effort by the Koch Network aimed at finding a permanent fix for the ""Dreamer"" issue. According to Gaitan, ads will target TV and digital audiences while the group also branches out into congressional advocacy, including working with more Democrats.

The Trump administration announced last year that it would end the Obama-era DACA program that granted protected status to immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children, sometimes called Dreamers.
Congress originally hoped to pass a permanent legislative fix for the nearly 2 million immigrants affected by the decision before March 5, when the first protections began to end, but were unable to come to an agreement.
Since the decision last year, several federal courts have ruled that the Trump administration must maintain the Obama-era program, and this week a California-based federal appeals court appeared unlikely to toss out a lower court ruling forcing the program to be maintained.
In March, the Supreme Court rejected a request from the Trump administration to take up the case, leaving the ruling for a lower court.

Earlier, the migrants marched from Friendship Park in Tijuana, Mexico to the San Ysidro port of entry. They stood on the Mexican side; on the other side lay San Diego, California. It was the final leg for some in the caravan of hundreds of migrants, which had reached Tijuana on Tuesday.
Alex Mensing, an organizer with Pueblo Sin Fronteras, which assembled the caravan, said 50 migrants were admitted to the immigration processing center on the Mexico side. However, that is incorrect. The migrants congregated on a bridge leading to the US border while waiting to be processed by American officials.
Before the group arrived, US Customs and Border Protection officials said the port had already reached full capacity, and migrants trying to get into the United States may need to wait in Mexico as officials process those already in the facility.
Some migrants said they had walked the last leg of the journey filled with anxiety. Others scarfed down food before they filed into the center, afraid there would be no food once they turned themselves in to border officials."

Last week, President Donald Trump vowed to “stop” the caravan, while Cabinet members said they would deliver a swift response. The asylum seekers held firm, setting up a possible showdown.
In an anticlimactic twist, about 50 asylum seekers were allowed past a gate controlled by Mexican officials to walk across a long bridge but were stopped at the entrance to the US inspection facility at the other end.

They were allowed to wait outside the building, technically on Mexican soil, without word of when US officials would let them claim asylum.
Another 50 or so camped on blankets and backpacks in Tijuana outside the Mexican side of the crossing, prohibited from even getting close to the US inspection building.
The asylum-seekers began the day with anticipation, travelling in red-and-white school buses under police escort to a beachfront rally in Tijuana, where a steel fence juts out into the Pacific Ocean.

They sang the Honduran national anthem, and supporters on the San Diego side of the fence waved a Honduran flag.
After a final briefing from lawyers, and minutes before they were to begin a short walk to the border crossing, US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan announced that the San Ysidro border crossing, the nation’s busiest, had “reached capacity” for people without legal documents and that asylum-seekers may need to wait in Mexico temporarily.
Mr Trump has commented frequently on the caravan since it started in Mexico on March 25 near the Guatemala border and headed north to Tijuana.
His broadsides came as his administration vowed to end what officials call “legal loopholes” and “catch-and-release” policies that allow people requesting asylum to be released from custody into the US while their claims make their way through the courts, which can take years.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called the caravan “a deliberate attempt to undermine our laws and overwhelm our system”.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said asylum claims will be resolved “efficiently and expeditiously” and warned that anyone making false claims could be prosecuted.
The administration’s stern warnings left organisers in disbelief that border inspectors were not ready for them.
“They have been well aware that a caravan is going to arrive at the border,” Nicole Ramos, an attorney working on behalf of caravan members, said at a news conference.
“The failure to prepare and failure to get sufficient agents and resources is not the fault of the most vulnerable among us. We can build a base in Iraq in under a week. We can’t process 200 refugees. I don’t believe it.”

The San Ysidro border inspection facility can hold about 300 people, according to Pete Flores, Customs and Border Protection’s San Diego field office director, suggesting the bottleneck may be short-lived. The agency processed about 8,000 asylum cases from October to February, or about 50 a day.
Asylum-seekers are typically held for up to three days at the border and then turned over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. If they pass an asylum officer’s initial screening, they may be detained or released into the US with ankle monitors.
Asylum seekers did not appear to be thrown by the delay.
Wendi Yaneri Garcia said she was confident she will be released while her asylum case is pending because she is travelling alone with her two-year-old son, who has been sick.
She said police in her hometown of Atlantida, Honduras, jailed her for protesting construction of a hydroelectric plant and that she received death threats after being released.
“All I want is a place where I can work and raise my son,” the 36-year-old said.

Elin Orrellana, a 23-year-old pregnant woman from El Salvador, said she is fleeing the violent MS-13 street gang, a favourite target of both Mr Sessions and Mr Trump because of their brutal killings in communities in the US.
She said her older sister had been killed by the gang in El Salvador, so she is attempting to join other family members in the Kansas City area.
“Fighting on is worth it,” she said as she camped out for chilly night outside the border crossing."

U.S. District Court Judge John Bates, the third federal judge and the first Republican appointee to rule against Trump administration attempts to kill DACA, wrote in a Tuesday opinion that the Department of Homeland Security has 90 days to provide him with a more compelling reason for rolling back the Obama-era program, otherwise he could order its restoration.
“DACA’s rescission was arbitrary and capricious because the Department failed adequately to explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful,” Bates wrote.
""Neither the meager legal reasoning nor the assessment of litigation risk provided by DHS to support its rescission decision is sufficient to sustain termination of the DACA program,"" he continued.
A Justice Department spokesman told Politico DOJ would continue to ""vigorously defend"" its position. ""DACA was implemented unilaterally after Congress declined to extend benefits to this same group of illegal aliens. As such, it was an unlawful circumvention of Congress,” spokesman Devin O'Malley wrote in a statement.

3287,Another Federal Judge Rules Against Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Order To Cancel DACA',HuffPost,4/25/2018,,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/judge-rules-against-canceling-daca_us_5adfd19ce4b07560f3967230,"A third federal judge ruled on Tuesday against the Trump administration’s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
In September, President Donald Trump canceled the Obama-era DACA program, which shields undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as youths from deportation. But in a stinging rebuke of the Trump administration’s legal logic, U.S. District Judge John Bates described the program’s cancellation as “arbitrary and capricious because the Department [of Homeland Security] failed adequately to explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful.”
“Neither the meager legal reasoning nor the assessment of litigation risk provided by DHS to support its rescission decision is sufficient to sustain termination of the DACA program,” Bates wrote in the opinion.
The ruling has no immediate effect, and the decision to cancel DACA has already been stalled by a nationwide injunction. Bates’ ruling is unique, however, because it opens the possibility that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services might have to start accepting new DACA applications. The current injunctions only require the federal government to renew the applications of people who have already been approved for the program.
Bates gave the Department of Homeland Security another 90 days to give a better explanation for canceling the program before moving forward with the decision.
The consolidated lawsuits seeking to overturn the DACA cancellation in the District of Columbia were brought by several parties, including the NAACP, Microsoft, two labor unions, Princeton University and DACA recipient Maria de la Cruz Perales Sanchez.
Tuesday’s ruling adds another layer of complexity to the Trump administration’s efforts to squelch former President Barack Obama’s last standing immigration reform. Other lawsuits are moving through the federal court system in California and New York.
Both suits will likely drag on for months just to get through the discovery period, when lawyers demand to see the evidence that will appear as the case goes to trial. Plaintiffs in the California and New York cases are pressing the Trump administration to cough up more documents to shed light on its reasons for abruptly canceling DACA last fall, despite leaving the program in place for the first nine months after Trump took office.
The Justice Department has argued that many of the documents describing the decision-making process are privileged and not subject to disclosure to the court."

6370,Trump Signs Memo Ordering End to \xe2\x80\x98Catch and Release\xe2\x80\x99 Immigration Policy',New York Times (Online News),4/7/2018,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/us/politics/trump-immigration-policy.html,"President Trump issued a memorandum on Friday directing his administration to move quickly to bring an end to “catch and release,” the practice by which immigrants presenting themselves at the border without authorization are released from detention while waiting for their cases to be processed.
The directive does not, on its own, toughen immigration policy or take concrete steps to do so; it merely directs officials to report to the president about steps they are taking to “expeditiously end ‘catch and release’ practices.” But it is a symbolic move by Mr. Trump to use his executive action to solve a problem that he has bitterly complained Congress will not.
It also caps a week that began with the president offering tough talk on immigration and ended with his ordering the National Guard to patrol the southwestern border, a move formalized on Friday night when Defense Secretary Jim Mattis signed orders to deploy up to 4,000 troops.
“The safety and security of the American people is the president’s highest priority, and he will keep his promise to protect our country and to ensure that our laws are respected,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement announcing the memorandum."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on Friday ordering the end of a policy, known as “catch and release,” in which illegal immigrants are released from detention while awaiting a court hearing on their status.
As part of the memo, Trump asked Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to produce a list of military facilities that could be used to detain illegal immigrants."
2988,Trump signs memo vowing end to \xe2\x80\x98catch-and-release\xe2\x80\x99 of illegal immigrants',Washington Times,4/7/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/apr/6/trump-signs-memo-vowing-end-to-catch-and-release-o/,"President Trump signed a directive Friday ordering the government to end the so-called “catch-and-release” policy at the border, moving to combat what the administration says is a growing “crisis” of illegal immigration.
He called for illegal immigrants nabbed at the border to be held in custody, to the fullest extent possible. He also ordered more asylum officers to head to detention centers so they can rule on cases faster, calculating that if they can clear the cases they can send undeserving migrants home without having to release them.
In a memo to his attorney general and secretaries of the State, Defense, Homeland and Health and Human Services departments, Mr. Trump also demanded regular updates on progress, and told them to submit requests for any new resources they need.
“The safety and security of the American people is the president’s highest priority, and he will keep his promise to protect our country and to ensure that our laws are respected,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.
Catch-and-release is the name Border Patrol agents and others involved in the immigration debate have given to the practice of arresting illegal immigrants, processing them and then having to set them free in the U.S., with the order that they return for a deportation hearing some time in the future.
They disappear into the shadows and most never bother to show for their hearings, which can be years later.
The Bush administration had tried to end catch-and-release by speeding up deportations of Mexicans. But a shift in migration patterns, with a surge in people from Central America — particularly children and families — has caused the issue to raise its head again.
U.S. law, court cases and Obama administration decisions have made it much tougher to deport those people, with a host of legal protections built up around them pushing for them to be released from custody if their cases can’t be cleared quickly.
Earlier Friday Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered prosecutors along the southwest border to bring criminal misdemeanor charges against people who jump the border.
Mr. Trump’s new memo calls on Mr. Sessions and the other departments to crack down on abuse of the asylum system, after illegal immigrants have learned how to game the system by using “magic words” indicating they fear being sent back home.
Before 2013, only about 1 percent of migrants showing up on the border claimed asylum. Now the number is higher than 10 percent, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said this week.
“Smugglers themselves are gaming the system, pure and simple. They take advantage of the loopholes in our laws. They know that we cannot prosecute as we need to to stop their behavior,” she said.

6283,"A BIG STEP': Trump says military will guard the US/Mexico border until wall can be built""",Fox News (Online),4/3/2018,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/04/03/trump-says-military-will-secure-southern-border-until-wall-can-be-built.html,"President Trump on Tuesday said that the U.S. will secure the southern border with the military until a wall can be built, calling the move a “big step.”
Trump made the remarks during a meeting with Baltic leaders, where he said he had discussed the matter with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. A White House official revealed later Tuesday to Fox News that the plan considered by Trump would be a “substantial” mobilization of the National Guard.
“Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military,” he said. “That's a big step, we really haven’t done that before, or certainly not very much before.”
At a news conference later, he confirmed the plan, saying the border is unprotected by “our horrible, horrible and very unsafe laws.”
“We don't have laws, we have catch-and-release,” he said. “You catch and then you immediately release and people come back years later for a court case, except they virtually never come back.”
Trump did not offer specifics, but the move appears to be at least partly motivated by a caravan of over 1,000 Central American migrants heading toward the U.S. border. Buzzfeed, which first reported on the caravan, said that Mexican officials had not yet attempted to stop the flow.
In Tuesday's discussion, Trump and senior officials “also agreed on the need to pressure Congress to urgently pass legislation to close legal loopholes exploited by criminal trafficking, narco-terrorist and smuggling organizations,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. She added that Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary Kirsten Nielsen, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford and Chief of Staff John Kelly were among the other officials present.
Reports of the caravan angered Trump, who has sent out a number of tweets threatening to end the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and to cut foreign aid to countries such as Honduras, from where many of the migrants originate.
“The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our “Weak Laws” Border, had better be stopped before it gets there,” he tweeted Tuesday. “Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!”
At the press conference he said that NAFTA was an “embarrasing” deal and that he had told Mexican officials on Monday: “I hope you're going to tell that caravan not to get up to the border.” He added that he thinks the caravan was being broken up as a result.
The Pentagon was scrambling to come up with a response to Trump's statement on the military guarding the border. But according to a memo obtained by Fox News and discussions with officials, one area where the Pentagon could contribute immediately is the Air Force’s Barry Goldwater live-fire range, which shares a 35-mile border with Mexico in southern Arizona.
The Defense Department is already offering some support to the border, including U.S. Navy ships patrolling waters to seize drugs as well as missions involving over 100 personnel from U.S. military’s northern command -- including eight planes and a drone -- to help border patrol.
In 2010, President Obama authorized 1,200 National Guard troops to increase security at the border, although Republican lawmakers questioned their role and whether they would in fact be “boots on the ground.""
Trump has struggled to secure funding for his central campaign promise of a wall, which the administration and border officials say will cost approximately $20-25 billion. In the omnibus bill signed by Trump last month, $1.6 billion was included for technology and some replacement of existing border fencing -- although it excluded the prototypes Trump recently viewed in California.
Trump briefly considered vetoing the legislation both over its lack of funding for the wall and also the failure to include a fix for the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that granted protection for illegal immigrants brought to the country as children. He has since floated the idea of getting the Pentagon to fund the wall.
Brandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol Council, said on Fox News Radio’s “The Todd Starnes Show” that it gives Border Patrol “certainty of apprehension.”
“The criminal smugglers, this is a multibillion dollar industry. They smuggle humans, they smuggle drugs,” he said. “This criminal enterprise, if we arrest the majority of people that cross the border illegally, we put a dent into their criminal enterprise, and if you put a dent into their criminal enterprise, then you can possibly stop them.”

6761,Trump: deploy military at U.S.-Mexico border until wall built',Reuters,4/3/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-trump/trump-deploy-military-at-u-s-mexico-border-until-wall-built-idUSKCN1HA1KP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s strategy for the U.S.-Mexico border includes mobilizing the National Guard, the White House said on Tuesday, after Trump had earlier spoken publicly to reporters about “guarding our border with the military” to stop illegal immigrants.

The White House statement was released after Trump met with Defense Secretary James Mattis, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other officials on border issues. It gave no details on whether or when Trump’s strategy might be implemented.
The National Guard, part of the U.S. military’s reserve forces, has been used in recent years for surveillance and intelligence on the border, but not direct law enforcement.
The president’s earlier remarks sharpened his recurring anti-immigration rhetoric. He said he wanted to deploy U.S. military forces until his long-promised border wall is built.
“Until we can have a wall and proper security we’re going to be guarding our border with the military,” Trump told reporters at the White House, lamenting what he called “horrible” U.S. laws that left the southern border poorly protected.
Trump railed against a “caravan” of Central American migrants traveling from the Mexico-Guatemala border in the last 10 days toward the United States, journeys that have occurred annually since 2010 in an effort to draw attention to the plight of people fleeing violence in their countries.
On Tuesday night, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said on Twitter that the caravan “dispersed gradually and at the decision of its participants.” Mexican officials say privately that they believe Trump has exaggerated the caravan’s importance to renew pressure on Mexico over the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
After 14 months in office, Trump still hammers regularly on an anti-immigration theme that helped to energize conservative Republican voters who helped him win the presidency in the 2016 election. Trump took a hard line on illegal immigration during the campaign and has also sought to curtail legal immigration.
His efforts have thus far failed to produce a comprehensive overhaul of America’s immigration laws or full funding for his border wall in the Republican-led Congress. No major legislation was expected before November’s congressional elections.
LEGAL QUESTIONS RAISED
His latest comments immediately raised questions in Congress and among legal experts about troop deployments on U.S. soil.
The Posse Comitatus Act, a federal law on the books since the 1870s, restricts using the U.S. Army and other main branches of the military for civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil, unless specifically authorized by Congress.
But the military can provide support services to law enforcement and has done so on occasion since the 1980s.
Under Republican President George W. Bush, the National Guard between 2006 and 2008 provided border-related intelligence analysis, but had no direct law enforcement role.
In 2010, President Barack Obama sent National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexican border to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support to U.S. Border Patrol agents.
Some specific statutes authorize the president to deploy troops within the United States for riot control or relief efforts after natural disasters.
“The details really matter here,” said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law.
“The real question is going to be if the president is serious about this, what kind of legal arguments do we get out of the White House and the Pentagon for such a deployment.”
A senior Republican aide in the U.S. House of Representatives said key lawmakers had not been briefed on the White House plan. The aide said there was no indication that a specific plan had even been formulated yet.
Geronimo Gutierrez, Mexico’s ambassador in Washington, said he had spoken to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen about Trump’s remarks on the border and that Mexico had formally asked the U.S. government to clarify them.
“It’s certainly not something that the Mexican government welcomes,” Gutierrez told CNN.
Nielsen, who took part in the meeting with Trump, said in a Twitter message late on Tuesday that she had been told by Mexican officials “the caravan is dissipating.”
In southern Mexico, officials screened the dwindling number of hundreds of largely Central American migrants on Tuesday.
At a campaign rally, Mexican leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is leading most polls by double digits before the July 1 presidential election, said that if the U.S. government militarizes the border, thousands of his supporters would protest by forming a “big human chain of Mexicans for peace.”
Some members of Congress said they were uncomfortable with the idea of using the military at the border.
Democratic Senator Brian Schatz said Trump should have to seek approval from Congress for any such troop deployment. “We should put that new law to a vote in the Senate,” he said on Twitter. “I predict fewer than 20 votes.”
In a Twitter post earlier on Tuesday, Trump said the caravan “heading to our ‘Weak Laws’ Border, had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!” Congress is on vacation until next week."
4836,"Trump\xe2\x80\x99s call to guard \xe2\x80\x9cour border with our military,\xe2\x80\x9d explained'",Vox,4/3/2018,,,https://www.vox.com/2018/4/3/17193490/trump-wall-border-military-explained,"President Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday that his administration is “going to be guarding our border with our military,” reaffirming the White House’s intent to circumvent Congress’s spending bill and beef up border security.
After Congress’s $1.3 trillion spending bill largely ignored Trump’s immigration priorities, the president, who begrudgingly signed the funding package in late March, has called on his administration to find ways to fund the border wall anyway. Trump said he spoke with Defense Secretary James Mattis about the idea last week, but it’s still not clear what directives — if any — the president has given.
One idea, reportedly pushed by White House adviser Stephen Miller, is to send the National Guard down to the border, according to Just Security’s Kate Brannen. Trump certainly wouldn’t be the first president to call on the National Guard to help enforce the border (both Barack Obama and George W. Bush did the same). But it comes with legal constraints and could cost millions with little in returns, something Obama was criticized for.
There are a lot of legal limitations to using Pentagon money for the border across the board. While Congress’s government funding package allocated $700 billion for defense spending, it’s not a blank check to the Pentagon, and the money is appropriated to specific programs. Deviating from those regulations could be illegal.
Of course, there are some workarounds, but they have the potential to be very politically fraught — and likely pretty ineffective on the border. Trump, however, seems fixated on the idea.
Trump could use the military’s money on the border. His options are limited.
Currently, Congress has allocated $1.6 billion for the border wall through the Department of Homeland Security, with specific instructions that those funds had to go toward repairing existing fencing or toward double fencing where barriers already exist. In other words, Trump’s “big, beautiful” wall did not get funding.
On enforcement, Republicans, who went into the spending fight wanting more funding for the Department of Homeland Security to increase the number of beds for immigrant detainees and to expand the enforcement force, settled for more modest spending measures. The final compromise included funding for only an additional 328 Customs and Border Protection officers, and ICE will actually have to reduce the number of detention beds. Needless to say, this isn’t the kind of deportation force Trump’s administration was envisioning.
But Trump’s call to redirect money from the military toward the border is fraught. Of course, because it’s the legislative branch’s constitutional right to allocate government funding (and it’s illegal to use federal funds for anything other than what Congress appropriates it for), Trump is legally limited.
Like Obama and Bush, he could call on the National Guard to go down to the border. But if that directive comes from the federal government, the guards legally can’t act as law enforcement. The Posse Comitatus Act forbids using the military in civilian law enforcement. It leaves Trump two options: have states send down their guards, which means states would have to foot the bill, or have guards on the border in non-law enforcement roles.
For example in 2010, when Obama deployed 1,200 National Guard troops to the border, they fixed infrastructure, worked on surveillance, and processed arrests — similar to Bush’s 2006’s Operation Jump Start. But even this was very expensive and was largely criticized for being ineffective.
“Critics of the deployment include budget hawks, who say it is a waste of money, and residents here along the border, who say they are tired of seeing armed troops in their back yard,” the Washington Post reported at the time. “The 1,200 National Guard troops have helped Border Patrol agents apprehend 25,514 illegal immigrants at a cost of $160 million — or $6,271 for each person caught.”
Another option is to tap into the emergency military construction funding known as MILCON. Up to $50 million can be used without congressional approval in cases of national security or to protect US military officers. As Brannen writes, “using MILCON funding is also guaranteed to make members of Congress particularly angry, because it would be the military construction projects in their districts that would be directly losing money to the wall.”
Not to mention that $50 million won’t get Trump much mileage on the border. For context, Congress appropriated $445 million for 25 miles of levee fencing in the Rio Grande Valley and $251 million to replace 14 miles of existing secondary fencing in the San Diego sector.
Trump told reporters Tuesday that using the military on the border would be a “big step” toward achieving his border security agenda.
But reality paints a very different picture."
3411,"Caravan of 1,000 Illegal Aliens Forces Trump to Talk Tougher With Mexico'",Townhall,4/2/2018,,,https://townhall.com/tipsheet/timothymeads/2018/04/01/caravan-of-1000-illegal-aliens-forces-trump-to-talk-tougher-with-mexico-n2466766,"Could a recent Buzzfeed news story force America to get even tougher with Mexico due to illegal immigration? Based on President Trump's tweets today, that answer is yes.
On Friday March 30th, BuzzFeed's Adolfo Flores documented shocking photos of more than 1,000 migrants from Central America marching through the streets Mexico on their way to the United States border. While the fact that migrants come through Mexico was not unsurprising, the sheer mass of people and the blatant unwillingness of Mexico's immigration agents to even bother with the problem was truly dismaying.
From BuzzFeed: Taking a drag from her cigarette, a Mexican immigration agent looked out toward a caravan of migrants that grew larger with each step they took on the two-lane highway. When the agent, who'd covered her uniform with an orange and white shawl, learned that the Central American migrants heading her way numbered more than 1,000, she took off for the restaurant across the street. “I'm going to have a relaxing Coke,” she told BuzzFeed News. For five days now hundreds of Central Americans — children, women, and men, most of them from Honduras — have boldly crossed immigration checkpoints, military bases, and police in a desperate, sometimes chaotic march toward the United States. Despite their being in Mexico without authorization, no one has made any effort to stop them. Organized by a group of volunteers called Pueblos Sin Fronteras, or People Without Borders, the caravan is intended to help migrants safely reach the United States, bypassing not only authorities who would seek to deport them, but gangs and cartels who are known to assault vulnerable migrants. Organizers like Rodrigo Abeja hope that the sheer size of the crowd will give immigration authorities and criminals pause before trying to stop them. “If we all protect each other we'll get through this together,” Abeja yelled through a loudspeaker on the morning they left Tapachula, on Mexico's border with Guatemala, for the nearly monthlong trek. When they get to the US, they hope American authorities will grant them asylum or, for some, be absent when they attempt to cross the border illegally. More likely is that it will set up an enormous challenge to the Trump administration's immigration policies and its ability to deal with an organized group of migrants numbering in the hundreds. The number of people who showed up to travel with the caravan caught organizers by surprise, and has overwhelmed the various towns they've stopped in to spend the night. Pueblos Sin Fronteras counted about 1,200 people on the first day. About 80% of them are from Honduras. Many said they are fleeing poverty, but also political unrest and violence that followed the swearing in of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández after a highly contested election last year. The group often breaks into chants of “out with JOH.” They also chant “we aren't immigrants, we're international workers” and “the people united will never be defeated.”
Apparently, this type of commute is the preferred method of illegal aliens because it guarantees safety in numbers.
Before setting out on the journey, the migrants were organized into groups of 10 to 15 people, and a leader was designated for each group. Five groups were then banded together in what organizers call a sector. While there are organizers from Pueblos Sin Fronteras leading the way, much of the effort to get to the US border is in the hands of the migrants themselves. They've been organized into security, food, and logistics committees. Organizers say it's meant to help the migrants empower themselves. Sandra Perez, 40, who's also from Honduras, is one of two women who belong to the security committee. It's not her first caravan: She has traveled with a procession of Central American mothers through Mexico in search of disappeared migrants. “I like doing this, it makes me happy and I feel useful,” she told BuzzFeed News. Not everyone is planning on crossing into the United States undetected. Migrants like Yonis, an Honduran man who declined to use his full name, are hoping to get their families to other parts of Mexico. He was able to legalize his status in Mexico and is hoping to get his wife and seven month old baby to the Mexican state Nuevo León. ""I have my life there,"" Yonis told BuzzFeed News. ""We're all here fighting together, going to different borders, chasing an American dream that sometimes becomes a reality or doesn't for some."" Organizers estimate that about two-thirds of people are planing on crossing into the United States undetected or asking for some type of protection like asylum. Twenty-nine-year-old Mateo Juan said the caravan was his third attempt at getting to the United States. Seven months ago, Mexican immigration officers pulled him off the bus. The same happened about a month ago. He heard about the caravan in March when he arrived in Tapachula, the caravan's starting point. “Going alone is risky. You're risking an accident, getting jumped by robbers, and even your life,” he told BuzzFeed News. “All of that, and then you don't get to the United States. The caravan is slower but you know you're going to get there safely.”
This led President Trump to tweet on Easter Sunday that America will finally have to deal with Mexico's ""cash cow"" - the North American Free Trade Agreement - if their government does not help prevent illegal immigration in to the United States.

The Mexican government has stopped a caravan of Central American migrants trying to reach the Mexico-US border as their presence in the country brought blistering attacks from the US president, Donald Trump.
In a statement issued on Monday night, the interior ministry and foreign relations ministry said the migrants had improperly entered the country and would be subject to administrative procedures.
“Under no circumstances does the government of Mexico promote irregular migration,” the statement said.
Approximately 400 caravan participants have already been removed from the country, according to the government.
Adolfo Flores, a BuzzFeed journalist covering the caravan, reported some of the migrants, such pregnant women and those with disabilities or chronic conditions, might be issued humanitarian visas. Everyone would have 10 days to leave the country or they could request a 30-day stay, during which time they could request permission to remain.
Organisers expected some of the participants to continue travelling north, though some would likely apply for asylum in Mexico.
Trump returned to the offensive on immigration on Monday, when he repeated a claim that “caravans” of migrants from Central America are threatening to enter the US via Mexico. He also demanded: “Act now Congress, our country is being stolen!”
“Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large ‘Caravans’ of people enter their country,” the president tweeted. “They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws.
“Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the weak Dem laws don’t allow them to do their job. Act now Congress, our country is being stolen!”
Trump’s use of the term “caravans” – also made in a sequence of tweets on Easter Sunday – had been reported on by Fox News, Trump’s preferred cable network.
The “nuclear option” he referred to would be a reform of Senate rules to allow major legislation to pass with 51 votes rather than the current 60. The Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has shown no sign of acceding to Trump’s repeated demand.
Mexico’s interior minister, Alfonso Navarete Prida, told reporters on Monday: “It is absolutely incorrect to say that there is no effort in Mexico to regulate, support and mange migratory processes.”

Flores reported on Friday: “For five days now, hundreds of Central Americans – children, women and men, most of them from Honduras – have boldly crossed immigration checkpoints, military bases, and police in a desperate, sometimes chaotic march toward the United States. Despite their being in Mexico without authorization, no one has made any effort to stop them.”

Upon announcing his presidential bid Donald Trump makes hardline immigration reform central to his campaign and pledges to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca). “I will immediately terminate President Obama’s illegal executive order on immigration,” he says. Weeks after winning the White House, ​​President-elect Trump appears to soften his stance on Dreamers. Despite offering no specific policy he promises to “work something out”. “On a humanitarian basis it’s a very tough situation.” he tells T​​ime magazine. Trump acknowledges the fraught road to a solution, describing Daca as a “very difficult thing for me as I love these kids”. “I have to deal with a lot of politicians,” Trump says. “And I have to convince them that what I’m saying is right.” Trump abruptly announces ​​he will end Daca, phasing out applications for renewal by March 2018. ​​The president insists the decision provides a “window of opportunity for Congress to finally act”. Following talks with Democrats, Trump hints a deal may be close, but suggests it wouldn’t include a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. “We’re not looking at citizenship. We’re not looking at amnesty,” Trump tells reporters. Trump promises to “take the heat” for a bipartisan Daca bill being brokered by senators. But within days he revokes his support, calling the bipartisan plan “a big step backwards”.​ The US government shuts down after negotiations over the budget and a Dreamers solution collapse. On the same day a district judge rules the administration must keep the program open to new applications, a ruling that is later supported by other federal court decisions. With the government reopened with a temporary bill, Trump tells reporters he is now open to a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers “over a period of 10-12 years” if the individual “does a great job, they work hard​”. Trump appears to end the possibility of a bipartisan deal over Daca with a series of furious tweets on Easter Sunday. He blames Democrats and declares: ""NO MORE DACA DEAL!"" Oliver Laughland
Organisers said some 1,300 people were participating in the caravan. Mexican immigration officials routinely detain and deport hundreds of thousands of Central Americans, who in recent years have streamed north to escape horrific violence in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Mexico deported 16,278 individuals in the first two months of 2018 – 97% of them were Central Americans.
The migrants’ paths through Mexico are perilous. Criminal gangs, often acting in cahoots with crooked public officials, prey upon migrants, often extorting them or kidnapping them for ransom.
Shelters run the length of the country, offering migrants a place to eat, rest and wash and tend to their wounds as they head north. The operators of these shelters expressed wariness with the caravan currently winding its way through southern Mexico, saying such attempts at moving migrants through Mexico often turn into targets for criminal groups.
Jorge Andrade, a spokesman for the shelters, says “polleros” – human smugglers – and other organised crime members have infiltrated previous caravans. People pretending to be migrants, meanwhile, joined in and started extorting actual migrants.
“It’s a real logistical challenge, in addition to security questions,” Andrade said. During a 2014 caravan that Andrade accompanied, “we realised that we had been infiltrated by people from organised crime, whom we could identify.”
Many of the participants in caravans inevitably are offered humanitarian visas, which allow them to temporarily remain in Mexico, or they file asylum applications.
Alex Mensing, project coordinator for Pueblos Sin Fronteras, which was accompanying the caravan, says the shelters in Mexico “do important work and caravan members have benefited from their services”. He added that migrants participating in the caravan would receive legal advice upon reaching the city of Puebla and some would likely seek asylum in Mexico.
“The people in the caravan are much, much less vulnerable to human rights abuses,” Mensing said.
On Monday, Trump widened his attack, tweeting: “DACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon … No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!”
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or Daca, was an Obama-era programme that shielded undocumented migrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers, from the threat of deportation.
“The [Trump] attack on Daca was designed to pit Central Americans against Mexicans and to put immigrants in the United States against immigrants who are trying to exercise their right to seek asylum in the the United States,” Mensing said.
Trump announced the cancellation of Daca last year. No replacement has been instituted but court orders have maintained protections for recipients.
Trump claimed on Sunday that “a lot of people are coming in because they want to take advantage of Daca, and we’re going to have to really see”.
In fact, to be eligible for Daca, applicants must have lived in the US continually since 15 June 2007 and come to the country before their 16th birthday. Applicants must also either be in school, or have graduated high school, or have been honourably discharged from the US military or coast guard.
Trump’s decision to quash any remaining hopes of a Daca deal drew criticism on Sunday. John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio who is seen as a possible primary challenger to Trump in 2020, tweeted: “A true leader preserves & offers hope, doesn’t take hope from innocent children who call America home. Remember, today is Easter Sunday.”
Trump rejected one deal with Democrats that would have funded a border wall, which he promised throughout his campaign for the White House would be paid for by Mexico. He has recently suggested the military could pay for the wall, a prospect experts said was extremely unlikely.

Later on Monday, Trump returned to the North American Free Trade Agreement, a favourite target which in his Sunday tweets he had threatened to “stop”. “Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA,” he wrote, adding: “With all of the money they make from the US, hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!”
Polls in Mexico show people south of the border support Nafta, but don’t see themselves as big winners from the trade deal, which also includes Canada.
Regarding possible motives for Trump’s latest outburst, which also took in Amazon, NBC and CNN, news outlets reported White House sources as saying Trump has been told his base thinks he has softened on immigration.
The president has also been beset by damaging stories, from developments in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian election interference and alleged collusion between Trump aides and Moscow, to adult film actor Stormy Daniels’ claim that she had an affair with the billionaire in 2006.
Controversies over ethics and spending are affecting members of the Trump administration, including the housing and urban development secretary, Ben Carson, and the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt.
On Sunday the former Veterans Affairs secretary David Shulkin told network television he was fired last week, rather than resigning as the White House claimed. Shulkin, who opposed the privatisation of VA operations, blamed political appointees for his downfall."

6093,Sessions Targets California Immigrants Using a Ruling That Protected Them',New York Times (Online News),3/9/2018,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/us/politics/jeff-sessions-california-lawsuit.html,"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions sued California this week for not doing enough to find and punish unauthorized immigrants, and said on Wednesday he was girding for an epic battle.
“California is using every power it has — and some it doesn’t — to frustrate federal law enforcement,” he said in a speech in Sacramento. “So you can be sure I’m going to use every power I have to stop them.”
One of the weapons Mr. Sessions is counting on is a 2012 Supreme Court ruling siding with the Obama administration, which had sued Arizona for violating federal immigration laws. But in that case Mr. Obama’s lawyers accused the state of going too far in trying to find and punish unauthorized immigrants.
“The state may not pursue policies that undermine federal law,” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority."
6245,"U.S. Justice Department sues California over 'sanctuary' policies""",Reuters,3/9/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-justice-immigration/u-s-justice-department-sues-california-over-sanctuary-policies-idUSKCN1GJ07T,"WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department sued the state of California over so-called “sanctuary” policies that try to protect illegal immigrants against deportation, ramping up a confrontation over whether local police should enforce federal law.
The lawsuit, filed late Tuesday in federal court in Sacramento, the California state capital, takes aim at three state laws passed last year that the Justice Department contends violate the U.S. Constitution.
The issue of illegal immigrants has become increasingly heated since Donald Trump became president last year and signaled that he planned to target a wider swath of people for deportation.
Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has made combating illegal immigration one of his top priorities since taking over the helm of the Justice Department in February 2017. A key part of that effort involves a crackdown on primarily Democrat-governed cities and states that Sessions claims are “sanctuaries” that protect illegal immigrants from deportation.
Sessions is expected to discuss the lawsuit during a speech on Wednesday morning in Sacramento. The Justice Department lawsuit cites a provision of the U.S. Constitution known as the “Supremacy Clause,” under which federal laws trump state laws.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra on Tuesday said law enforcement in the state is focused on public safety, not deportation. The Trump administration’s legal arguments are similar to those it has made in other cases, he said, and his office is prepared to address them.
“We’ve seen this ‘B’ rated movie before,” Becerra said on a call with reporters.
Brown in October signed into law a bill that prevents police from inquiring about immigration status and curtails law enforcement cooperation with immigration officers.

“The Department of Justice and the Trump administration are going to fight these unjust, unfair and unconstitutional policies that have been imposed on you,” Sessions plans to tell a group of law enforcement officers on Wednesday, according to prepared remarks seen by Reuters.
Early into his tenure, Trump signed an executive order that sought to block municipalities that failed to cooperate with U.S. immigration authorities from receiving federal grant funding.
However, the Justice Department’s attempts to implement the order to date have been stymied by lawsuits in the federal courts in Chicago, San Francisco and Philadelphia.
At issue is whether sanctuary cities are violating a federal law that requires them to share information about people they arrest with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.
One case is now on appeal, after a federal judge in San Francisco blocked Trump’s executive order to block funding to sanctuary cities.
Similar kinds of cases are under way in other parts of the country, including a case on appeal in Chicago after a federal judge issued a nationwide injunction barring the government from blocking grant money typically used to help local police combat violent crime and help victims.
The Justice Department’s lawsuit on Tuesday against California targets three state laws. One of them, known as Assembly Bill 450, prohibits private employers in California from voluntarily cooperating with federal immigration officials.
A second law, Senate Bill 54, prevents state and local law enforcement from giving federal immigration officials information about when they intend to release an illegal immigrant from their custody.

The third law empowers the state to inspect federal immigration detention centers.
The Justice Department filing says all three laws improperly attempt to regulate federal immigration at the state level. The department also plans to seek a court order from a judge to temporarily block the state from enforcing the laws."
3224,Sessions likens California sanctuary laws to slave-state nullification',Washington Times,3/9/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/mar/7/sessions-calif-sanctuary-slave-state-nullification/,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions compared California’s new sanctuary city laws to attempts by slave-holding southern states to nullify federal laws, and blasted California officials Wednesday for attempting to force a “radical open borders agenda” on the rest of the country.
Speaking to California police and sheriffs, Mr. Sessions defended his decision to file a lawsuit against California this week seeking to block three state laws he says are thwarting federal agents’ ability to stop illegal immigration.
And he took specific aim at Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, saying she actively aided illegal immigrants in escaping arrest last month by warning them of an impending sweep by federal deportation officers.
“Here’s my message to Mayor Schaaf: How dare you,” the attorney general said. “How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of law enforcement to promote a radical open borders agenda.”
Ms. Schaaf has defended her actions, saying she was trying to give illegal immigrants the tools to defend their rights, and saying she wanted to keep families together.
She won praise from state officials, who said California is proud to be a sanctuary.
The state government approved three laws last year that severely limit cooperation police can provide to federal immigration authorities, and also prohibit private businesses from cooperating as well.
Mr. Sessions said those laws interfere with the federal government, which under the Constitution and laws passed by Congress has supreme power over immigration.
“There is no nullification. There is no secession,” he said. “Federal law is ‘the supreme law of the land.’ I would invite any doubters to go to Gettysburg, to the tombstones of John C. Calhoun and Abraham Lincoln. This matter has been settled.”
Mr. Sessions called the laws “an embarrassment” to the state.
He wondered what would happen if a state passed a law to thwart the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to target polluters.
California officials have defended their policies, saying federal agents are allowed to conduct enforcement — but state and local police shouldn’t be forced to assist.
They argue that immigrants, including those in the country legally, are less willing to cooperate on reporting other crimes if they fear immigration agents could become involved.

3809,Second U.S. judge blocks Trump administration from ending DACA program',Reuters,2/14/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-ruling/second-u-s-judge-blocks-trump-administration-from-ending-daca-program-idUSKCN1FX2TJ,"FILE PHOTO - People protest for immigration reform for DACA recipients and a new Dream Act, in Los Angeles, California, U.S. January 22, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson
(Reuters) - A second U.S. judge on Tuesday blocked President Donald Trump’s decision to end a program that protects immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children from deportation.
U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn ruled that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, cannot end in March as the Republican administration had planned, a victory for Democratic state attorneys general and immigrants who sued the federal government.
The decision is similar to a Jan. 9 ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco that DACA must remain in place while litigation challenging Trump’s decision continues.
The legal battle over DACA complicates a debate currently underway in Congress on whether to change the nation’s immigration laws.
The Supreme Court on Friday is due to consider whether to take up the administration’s appeal of the San Francisco ruling. The court could announce as soon as Friday afternoon whether it will hearing the case.
Garaufis said the administration could eventually rescind the DACA program but that the reasons it gave last September for rescinding it were too arbitrary and could not stand. The judge ordered the administration to process DACA renewal applications on the same terms as had been in place before the president took his action.
In a statement, U.S. Justice Department spokesman Devin O’Malley said DACA was implemented unilaterally by Trump’s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama and thus unlawfully circumvented Congress.
“The Justice Department will continue to vigorously defend this position, and looks forward to vindicating its position in further litigation,” O’Malley said.
Often called “Dreamers,” hundreds of thousands of young adults, mostly Hispanics, have been granted protection from deportation and given work permits under DACA, which was created in 2012."
5389,Second Judge Blocks Trump Decision To End Deportation Relief For Dreamers',HuffPost,2/14/2018,,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daca-dreamers-second-judge-injunction_us_5a8366a4e4b02b66c51301c5,"Lucy Nicholson / Reuters DACA recipients and their supporters call for renewal of the program outside Disneyland in Anaheim, California, on Jan. 22, 2018.
A second federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump’s decision to cancel the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, dealing another blow to the president’s efforts to end protections for nearly 700,000 undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children.
The nationwide preliminary injunction issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn mirrors a separate ruling handed down last month in California. Because the cancellation of DACA has already been halted, Garaufis’ order won’t have any immediate effect on Dreamers.
But the second injunction marks a win for Trump’s opponents, who have used the courts to defend DACA, even as the White House has sought to use the March 5 deadline set by the president as leverage to win concessions on border security from Democrats in Congress.
It could also complicate Trump’s own efforts in the courts. His administration has asked the Supreme Court to take the unusual step of overturning the first injunction, issued by U.S. District Judge William Alsup, now instead of letting it go through the normal appeals process.
The Supreme Court could decide as soon as Friday whether it will hear the administration’s request ― unless the new injunction delays that process. As of Tuesday, the justices were only scheduled to consider a request to overturn the injunction in the consolidated case out of California, according to Karen Tumlin, legal director for the National Immigration Law Center, one of the groups suing the administration over DACA.
Trump declared he would rescind DACA in September, claiming it was unconstitutional. The White House aimed to terminate the program in phases, allowing recipients whose work permits and deportation protections would expire by March 5 to apply for renewal during a four-week window, but barring all new applicants. The plan was that Dreamers whose permits were set to expire after March 5 would be unable to apply for renewal, creating that deadline for Congress to act before an estimated 1,000 people per day began losing protections.
Under the injunctions, however, those who have been approved for DACA are eligible to keep renewing it until the courts decide otherwise.
Because President Barack Obama created the program by executive action, Trump has the authority to scrap it. But the consolidated New York lawsuit ― which combines a case originally filed on behalf of DACA recipient Martín Jonathan Batalla Vidal with a suit filed by attorneys general from 15 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia ― argues that the administration violated DACA recipients’ due process rights and the terms of the Administrative Procedure Act when changing the policy. The APA requires federal officials to offer a reasonable justification before changing a major policy.
The Trump administration’s claim that the program is unconstitutional isn’t likely to stand up in court, according to Garaufis’ order. Trump’s decision to end DACA appears instead to be “arbitrary and capricious” and “an abuse of discretion,” the judge wrote.
“The question before the court is thus not whether Defendants could end the DACA program, but whether they offered legally adequate reasons for doing so,” the order says. “Based on its review of the record before it, the court concludes that Defendants have not done so.”
In a statement, Justice Department spokesman Devin O’Malley responded, “Today’s order doesn’t change the Department of Justice’s position on the facts: DACA was implemented unilaterally after Congress declined to extend these benefits to this same group of illegal aliens.”
The judge did not weigh in on the plaintiffs’ argument that Trump violated the Constitution by discriminating against DACA recipients based on animus toward Latinos. Nearly 80 percent of DACA recipients are originally from Mexico, a country the president has accused of sending rapists and other criminals into the U.S.
These injunctions are just a stop-gap solution for DACA recipients. Although they can still apply for renewal, it can take months for permits to be reviewed and approved, and many people’s protections are likely to lapse in the meantime. And, of course, the Trump administration is fighting to overturn the rulings and go back to rejecting applicants.
The president has said he wants to help young undocumented immigrants ― and maybe even grant them a pathway to citizenship ― but only if Democrats agree to fund his southern border wall, detain and deport more children and others at the border, and restrict legal immigration. His framework for a deal is considered dead on arrival in Congress because of heavy opposition from Democrats and some Republicans to slashing legal immigration, but the president hasn’t budged."

This ruling by Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District Court of New York, combined with a ruling from a California judge in January, means the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program could end past its planned March 5 date, CNN reports.
The judge said the decision to end the program was based on the ""plainly incorrect factual premise"" that the program was illegal.
""The question before the court is thus not whether defendants could end the DACA program, but whether they offered legally adequate reasons for doing so,"" wrote Judge Garaufis, a Clinton appointee to the court, according to the Washington Times.

6757,"2 senators offer bipartisan bill protecting young immigrants, but Trump quickly rejects it'",PBS NewsHour,2/5/2018,,,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/2-senators-offer-new-bipartisan-bill-protecting-young-immigrants,"WASHINGTON — A bipartisan immigration proposal has surfaced in the Senate, only to be quickly knocked down by President Donald Trump via Twitter on Monday.
Republican Sen. John McCain and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons planned to propose legislation Monday that would shield from deportation immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally as children, known as “Dreamers” helped by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. The bill also would strengthen border security, but it wouldn’t provide the $25 billion Trump wants for a U.S.-Mexico border wall.
But before the Senate had a chance to consider the narrow plan, Trump seemed to reject it on Twitter.
“Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal!” Trump tweeted.
Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2018
McCain, R-Ariz., and Coons, D-Del., said in a statement that their bill was designed to focus on two “pressing” border issues — the “Dreamers” and border security — so lawmakers could focus on completing a long-overdue budget deal.
The McCain-Coons plan is a more modest approach than Trump has sought for protecting the estimated 1.8 million young immigrants. The measure lacks Trump’s demands for limiting the relatives that “Dreamers” can sponsor for citizenship, and ending a visa lottery aimed at admitting more immigrants from diverse places including Africa.
The senators’ plan would create a road to legal status for “Dreamers” who arrived in the U.S. by the end of 2013 and meet other criteria, including no convictions for serious crimes. Once they’ve become lawful permanent residents, they can follow existing procedures to apply for citizenship.
Democrats and some Republicans want to give “Dreamers” a pathway to citizenship, but oppose cuts Trump would make in the number of legal immigrants allowed to enter the U.S. Conservatives oppose letting “Dreamers” become citizens. That stalemate has led many to believe the likeliest outcome is a narrowly focused bill or even no legislation at all.
The senators’ proposal is similar to a bipartisan House package by Reps. Will Hurd, R-Texas, and Pete Aguilar, D-Calif.

Sens. John McCain, R., Ariz. and Chris Coons, D., Del., plan to unveil a proposal that offers a path to citizenship for young immigrants known as “Dreamers” who have lived in the U.S. since Dec. 31, 2014, the Wall Street Journal reported. That is expected to be a larger group than would be covered by President Trump’s proposal to provide legal status to 1.8 million young immigrants.
“It’s time we end the gridlock so we can quickly move on to completing a long-term budget agreement that provides our men and women in uniform the support they deserve,” McCain said in a statement to the Journal.
McCain was part of a failed effort in 2013 known as the Gang of Eight that would have provided a path to citizenship for immigrants living in the country illegally.
“While reaching a deal cannot come soon enough for America’s service members, the current political reality demands bipartisan cooperation to address the impending expiration of the DACA program and secure the southern border,” he said, referring to former President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, that protected young immigrants from deportation and provided them work permits.
The bipartisan Senate bill also orders a comprehensive study to determine border-security measures to implement. It would provide a $110 million annual grant for five years to improve coordination between border-patrol agents and state and local law-enforcement officials.
It would call for hiring 55 new immigration court judges annually for three years, to clear a backlog of asylum cases. And it would order the State Department to provide a three-year strategy to help Central American countries address the causes of illegal immigration to the U.S., such as drug and gang violence.
The bill does not include some proposals preferred by Trump.
In exchange for protecting “Dreamers,” Trump wants funding for a border wall and changes to other parts of the immigration system, such as ending the visa lottery program and limiting family-based immigration.
The immigration debate is challenging Congress’ need to reach a long-term government funding deal.
Trump announced last year he would end the DACA program, and he gave Congress until March 5 to address the status of the immigrants.
Lawmakers are unlikely to reach an immigration deal before Feb. 8, when they must vote on another short-term government spending bill.
Parts of the government temporarily shut down last month because Democrats wanted a vote on an immigration deal to be tied to a government funding bill."

In unearthing rare data that details the crimes and sentences of illegals in Arizona, the Crime Prevention Research Center reported that immigrants age 15-35, the general population of the 700,000 in Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, “commit crime at twice the rate of young U.S. citizens.”
The impact of illegal aliens on crime rates https://t.co/yivtkhQuax — CrimeResearch (@CrimeResearch1) January 12, 2018
John R. Lott Jr., president of the center, said that if the Arizona data were averaged out nationally, the crime numbers would be stunning.
“If undocumented immigrants committed crime nationally as they do in Arizona, in 2016 they would have been responsible for over 1,000 more murders, 5,200 rapes, 8,900 robberies, 25,300 aggravated assaults, and 26,900 burglaries,” he wrote in the report.
Proponents of letting DACA recipients stay in the United States, the topic of debate in the White House and on Capitol Hill, have often portrayed the illegals as law abiding students and workers.
Those claims however has come under fire by groups armed with new statistics like Lott’s treasure trove.
“Undocumented immigrants are at least 142 percent more likely to be convicted of a crime than other Arizonans. They also tend to commit more serious crimes and serve 10.5 percent longer sentences, more likely to be classified as dangerous, and 45 percent more likely to be gang members than U.S. citizens,” he found.
And it’s worse for DACA-aged illegals.
For example, he wrote, “while undocumented immigrants from 15 to 35 years of age make up about 0.81 percent of the Arizona population, they make up almost 8 percent of the prison population.”
According to his estimates in Arizona:
DACA-age immigrants represent 71.2 percent of the undocumented immigrants in prison.
DACA-age eligible undocumented immigrants are 884 percent more likely to be convicted of crimes than their share of the population.

6987,Restrictionists Are Misleading You About Immigrant Crime Rates',Reason,2/2/2018,,,http://reason.com/archives/2018/02/01/immigrants-and-crime,"President Donald Trump never misses an opportunity to depict unauthorized immigrants—especially of the Hispanic variety—as ""rapists and criminals."" He
did it again in his State of the Union address when he drew attention to two Long Island teenage girls killed by the El Salvadorian gang MS13. Those deaths are tragic, but they don't say much one way or the other about the propensity of these immigrants to commit crimes.
You wouldn't, however, know that from restrictionist pundits who are working overtime to sell the ""illegal immigrants are criminals"" narrative. A case in point is former US Civil Rights Commission member Peter Kirsanow's recent piece in National Review purporting to show that these immigrants are more likely to commit crimes than the native born. But Kirsanow uses incomplete and cherry-picked data—and makes rookie mistakes in interpreting it to boot—that eviscerate the credibility of his case.
Kirsanow is correct that most of the disagreements over the criminality of undocumented immigrants could be resolved by better data. But that doesn't absolve us from accurately reading the data we do have. Kirsanow, however, does not. His entire case is based on a gross misreading of the 2011 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), a federal program that partially reimburses states and localities for the cost of incarcerating certain criminal aliens.
The SCAAP report shows that in 2009, there were 295,959 criminal aliens incarcerated in state and local prisons at any given time that year. From this number, he subtracts those in the country legally and assumes that the balance gives one the total number of illegal immigrants incarcerated that year. He compares that number with the population of illegals in various states to estimate their crime rates. Then he compares that rate with the crime rate of citizens to come up with a massively inflated ""incarceration rate"" of these aliens.
But here's the problem with his analysis:
Kirsanow assumed, as some others before him with only a passing familiarity with these databases, that the 295,959 figure refers to the number of individuals incarcerated. In fact, it is the total number of incarcerations. In other words, if a criminal alien was incarcerated for 10 short sentences, released after each one, and then re-incarcerated, then that single alien would account for 10 incarcerations under the SCAAP figure for that year. But Kirsnaow counts that as 10 individuals.
However, when it comes to estimating the incarceration rate of natives, Kirsanow compares the number of individuals incarcerated with their total population. This nonsensical apples-to-oranges comparison yields an exceedingly unfavorable ""incarceration rate"" for undocumented immigrants. Indeed, for three of the five states he examines, the undocumented incarceration rate is 10-100 points higher than the natives, when more credible studies show that the reality may be closer to the opposite.*
Kirsanow failed to appreciate that the purpose of the GAO report was to estimate the reimbursement that Uncle Sam owes state and local governments for incarcerating criminal illegal immigrants. Thus, the agency was only interested in the total number of incarcerations over the course of a year. It didn't care to separate out the number of offenses from the number of offenders. That is why the GAO report is nearly worthless for any scholarly attempt to estimate illegal immigrant crime rates.
A quick look at American Community Survey (ACS) data further confirms just how out-of-line Kirsanow's estimate is. (The ACS is an annual mini-census that, among other things, gathers information about prisoners in adult correctional facilities. It doesn't report on the broad legal status of immigrants but does indicate whether they are American citizens and their country of birth, making it possible to separate immigrants from Americans.)
For 2008, the ACS reported that there were 156,329 non-citizens incarcerated in all three—federal, state, and local—adult correctional facilities. This is only half of the 296,959 incarcerations that SCAAP reports in just state and local prisons making it logically impossible for the 296,959 figure to be referring to the total number of criminal aliens incarcerated.
Kirsanow is merely an individual whose analysis can be discounted. But there is no discounting the Alien Incarceration Report jointly released by the Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Homeland Security (DHS) last December. It too misrepresented data when it estimated that ""one-in-five of all persons in the [federal] Bureau of Prisons custody were foreign born, and that 94 percent of confirmed aliens in custody were unlawfully present."" That seems shockingly high as illegal immigrants are, at most, about 4 percent of the population. But if this report were right, they would be 19 percent of all prisoners.
But the report had no solid basis for its conclusion because it did not have all the prison data. If you scroll down beyond the report's press release and Summary of Findings, it admits as much. It notes:
This report does not include data on the foreign-born or alien populations in state prisons and local jails because state and local facilities do not routinely provide DHS or DOJ with comprehensive information about their inmates and detainees. This limitation is noteworthy because state and local facilities account for approximately 90 percent of the total U.S. incarcerated population. DHS and DOJ are working to develop a reliable methodology for estimating the status of state and local incarcerated populations in future reports. Of course that didn't stop Fox News and other similar outfits from using it to peddle their ""illegal immigrants are hardened criminal"" line.
It is really important to bear in mind that the federal prison population is not representative of the incarcerated populations in state and local prisons. That's because federal prisons house illegal immigrants who commit immigration offenses. The ones who commit more serious crimes tend to be housed in state adult correctional facilities.
Only 85 total people who were convicted of murder were sentenced to federal prison in 2016. But the total number of murder convictions nationwide that year was 17,785. Clearly, only a small fraction of a percent of all murderers are incarcerated in federal prisons so most undocumented immigrants in these facilities are not hardened criminals.
As Kirsanow acknowledged, the government doesn't keep good data on illegal immigrant incarcerations in state correctional facilities. But the data we do have suggests that they are actually much less crime-prone than native-born Americans.
The Texas Tribune reported, after examining data obtained from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, that illegal immigrants are underrepresented in local jails. They are only 4.6 percent of Texas inmates while they make up 6.3 percent of that state's total population.
Some academic researchers have examined quasi-natural policy shifts to see how crime rates change due to more intense immigration enforcement. If illegal immigrants are more crime-prone, then more aggressive immigration enforcement in an area should lower crime rates. But they found no overall reduction. This suggests, at a minimum, that illegal immigrants' crime rate is no higher than that of the broader population.
More recent research conduced by Michelangelo Landgrave and me finds similar results. We applied a statistical technique that is used to figure out the employment, age, and occupations of immigrants in the census to the incarcerated population data in the American Community Survey. This allowed us to estimate the percentage of illegals among the incarcerated. We found that even if one includes in the mix those in detention facilities—most whom are there for immigration-related offenses—illegal immigrants are 44 percent less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans. Excluding those in immigration detention yields an incarceration rate that is almost identical to that of legal immigrants: A dramatic 69 percent lower than that of natives.
Restrictionists want the public to believe that undocumented immigrants are criminals in order to justify harsh enforcement policies and crackdowns. But before America goes down this draconian path, it is vital that it gets the facts straight. Taking amateur analyses or government spin at face value will hurt peaceful and hardworking immigrants without making Americans safer.
*CORRECTION: Due to an editing error, this sentence initially stated that the undocumented incarceration rate was higher in all the states examined. It is higher in three of the five."
6418,Trump\xe2\x80\x99s claim that immigrants bring \xe2\x80\x98tremendous crime\xe2\x80\x99 is still wrong',Washington Post,2/2/2018,,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/01/18/trumps-claim-that-immigrants-bring-tremendous-crime-is-still-wrong/,"— President Trump, in remarks at the White House, Dec. 6
Trump earned Four Pinocchios the last time we looked into his claim that immigrants cause crime rates to rise in the United States. Fresh data and several new studies have been released since that fact-check in 2015, and we took another look at the body of knowledge to see how the president’s view holds up.
AD
When we fact-checked him as a candidate in 2015, Trump spoke of immigrants generally and without distinguishing between legal and unauthorized residents. But in his most recent statements on Dec. 6, the president narrowed it down to “illegal immigrants … bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.” (We’re not evaluating Trump’s claim that Democrats “want to have illegal immigrants.”)
AD
Is Trump on solid ground now when he says unauthorized immigrants make the country less safe?
The Facts
As we found in 2015, it’s all but impossible to determine whether Trump’s statement is accurate concerning either legal or undocumented immigrants.
The Department of Justice says 90 percent of prisoners are housed at the state or local levels. That’s because almost all crimes are prosecuted by state and local law enforcement agencies, not the federal government.
AD
States generally do not track how many of their prisoners are undocumented immigrants. But most states do report their total number of noncitizen prisoners every year to the Justice Department, without breaking down their legal status.
Noncitizens accounted for 4 percent of the total prison population in the states, according to reports from the Bureau of Justice Statistics from 2013 to 2016, the most recent year for which data are available. (This figure excludes California and a handful of other states that did not provide data on noncitizen prisoners to the Justice Department.)
AD
At the federal level, noncitizens made up 11 percent to 12 percent of the total prison population from 2013 to 2015, the reports show. The Bureau of Justice Statistics changed its methodology in 2018 at the request of the Justice Department, said Elizabeth Ann Carson, the bureau’s statistician. So in the 2016 report, the number of noncitizen federal prisoners jumped from 21,479 to 39,956, or from 11 percent of the federal prison population to 21 percent, because of this methodology change, she said.
AD
The difference is that the Bureau of Justice Statistics previously reported the number of noncitizens housed in federal prisons, but now it adds those in privately run or community correctional facilities. The BJS data do not factor in persons detained by the Department of Homeland Security, which enforces immigration laws.
The 21 percent rate now appears to track with separate data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which found that noncitizens accounted for 20 percent of total federal prison sentences in fiscal year 2016, excluding immigration offenses.
AD
Trump’s campaign pointed to Sentencing Commission data to support its claims in 2015. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
AD
Some experts say the BJS data are unreliable because, among other reasons, state officials ask prisoners to self-report whether they are legal or undocumented residents. As we noted, a handful of states do not report their number of noncitizen prisoners to the Justice Department, which means the BJS data undercount the total.
But since it’s the closest thing to a yardstick provided by the federal government, it’s worth analyzing the data. (Incidentally, the Homeland Security and Justice departments “are working to develop a reliable methodology for estimating the status of state and local incarcerated populations in future reports,” according to a December report they released.)
AD
Excluding five states that did not provide data, state and federal correctional facilities in 2016 housed 1.3 million prisoners, of which 83,556, or 6 percent, were noncitizens, according to the latest BJS report. The total immigrant population stood at 43.7 million in 2016, or 13.5 percent, according to Census data.
AD
A comparison of these figures shows that noncitizens are far underrepresented in the prison population at the state level (4 percent), overrepresented at the federal level after excluding immigration offenses (21 percent), and far below their share of the population when combining both state and federal prisons (6 percent).
Let’s move on to the new research studies released since our fact-check from 2015.
The majority of the research available on this question continues to show that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born and that overall crime rates decline in areas where immigrants settle. However, many of these studies use statistical modeling in the absence of reliable and standardized state-level data about immigrant prisoners or convicts.
AD
AD
A March 2017 study by the pro-immigration Cato Institute found that “all immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than natives relative to their shares of the population” and that “even illegal immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans.”
Analyzing Census data from the 2014 American Community Survey, authors Michelangelo Landgrave and Alex Nowrasteh found that 2,194,435 individuals were incarcerated in 2014. The imprisonment rate for unauthorized immigrants was 0.85 percent, and 0.47 percent for legal immigrants, they found. Subtracting immigration-related offenses, the rate was lower for unauthorized immigrants: 0.5 percent.
The American Immigration Council, another pro-immigration group, estimated that there were 11.2 million undocumented immigrants in 2013. The total population that year was 316.2 million, according to the Census, which means illegal immigrants made up 3.5 percent of the total population when using the council’s estimate.
AD
AD
Cato’s study suggests that unauthorized immigrants are dramatically underrepresented in the U.S. prison population, including or excluding immigration offenses. Meanwhile, 45 percent of Americans say immigrants make the crime situation worse, 9 percent say they make the crime situation better, and 43 percent say there is not much effect, according to a Gallup survey from 2017.
“We’re running against the popular current,” Nowrasteh said. “We’re not running against the weight of empirical evidence on this claim. Our findings are actually pretty consistent with those in peer-reviewed journals as well as other scholarly publications.”
According to “The Integration of Immigrants into American Society,” a 2015 peer-reviewed study of years of academic research, the perception that immigrants bring crime to the United States has been popular for nearly a century and “is perpetuated by ‘issue entrepreneurs’ who promote the immigrant-crime connection in order to drive restrictionist immigration policy.”
AD
AD
“Far from immigration increasing crime rates, studies demonstrate that immigrants and immigration are associated inversely with crime,” the study, published by the National Academy of Sciences, concludes. “Immigrants are less likely than the native-born to commit crimes, and neighborhoods with greater concentrations of immigrants have much lower rates of crime and violence than comparable nonimmigrant neighborhoods. However, crime rates rise among the second and later generations, perhaps a negative consequence of adaptation to American society.”
But, once again pointing to the dearth of good data, the authors added: “While the research is conclusive on the statistical relation between immigration and crime, there is still a lot to be learned because of limitations in the available data. The extent to which this relationship is truly generalizable or robust for all immigrant groups needs further study.”
As the Fact Checker reported in 2015, one study showed that between 1990 and 2013, “the foreign-born share of the U.S. population grew from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent and the number of unauthorized immigrants more than tripled from 3.5 million to 11.2 million.
AD
“During the same period, FBI data indicate that the violent crime rate declined 48 percent — which included falling rates of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, and murder. Likewise, the property crime rate fell 41 percent, including declining rates of motor vehicle theft, larceny/robbery, and burglary,” according to the American Immigration Council.
In short, the violent crime rate was cut nearly by half during a period in which unauthorized immigrants tripled, according to the council.
Some experts caution that this study and Cato’s — which are based on Census data — and the Bureau of Justice Statistics figures should all be taken with a heavy dose of salt. State authorities and census workers are relying on offenders to self-report whether they are legal residents or undocumented, which is not an easy proposition for those facing possible deportation.
“Is the ACS doing a good job of capturing the foreign-born? It didn’t in the past,” said Steven A. Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which has documented several issues with the quality of Census data on immigrant prisoners. “The question is, How good is it now? … What I can say is that the incarceration data in the ACS looks more consistent over time, but that sometimes means it could be consistently undercounting.”
Across the spectrum, experts agree that Trump’s claims are nearly impossible to verify without reliable and standardized data on state-level offenders who are undocumented immigrants.
Camarota’s group opposes sanctuary city policies and advocates for less legal immigration. He added that without solid data from the states, it’s not possible to reach sound conclusions on immigrant crime rates. “It is not our contention that the data is clear that immigrants commit a disproportionate share of crime,” Camarota said.
John R. Lott of the Crime Prevention Research Center in December released a study of prisoner data from the Arizona Department of Corrections. “The murder and manslaughter rate for illegal immigrants is 2.7 times higher than the average for U.S. citizens,” Lott said of the study, which maps 32 1/2 years of prisoner statistics in a state with a history of making headlines for its tough immigration enforcement policies.
“While undocumented immigrants from 15 to 35 years of age make up a little over 2 percent of the Arizona population, they make up almost 8 percent of the prison population,” Lott found. “These immigrants also tend to commit more serious crimes.”
He added that undocumented immigrants in the Arizona data, which cover 1985 to 2017, had the highest incarceration rate compared with legal immigrants and U.S. citizens. Legal immigrants had a lower rate than U.S. citizens, he said.
“What we’re finding is that people who are legal immigrants tend to be extremely law-abiding,” Lott said. “But illegal immigrants commit crimes at extremely high rates. And when you lump them together you get something in the middle.”
The Arizona figures are “great data in the sense that it doesn’t lump the two together” and because they do not rely on offenders self-reporting their immigration status, Lott said.
Lott’s review appears to be unique — no other comparable research on state correctional data has been conducted — and an outlier, since the majority of other studies have come to diametrically opposite conclusions, including those in peer-reviewed publications. [Update: After we published this fact-check, Lott’s methodology was called into question. We dive into that debate in a separate fact-check.]
The Pinocchio Test
Trump for years has argued that immigrants pose a threat to public safety, bringing higher crime to the communities where they settle. When we last fact-checked his statements in 2015, Trump was speaking about immigrants generally and without separating legal residents from unauthorized ones. Most recently, on Dec. 6, the president said “illegal immigrants” were “bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.”
The Justice Department reports that 90 percent of U.S. prisoners are housed in state or local institutions, and because states generally do not report data breaking down how many of their prisoners are undocumented immigrants, experts on several sides of the immigration debate say it is not possible to verify Trump’s claim. The admittedly incomplete data that the Justice Department does publish on noncitizen prisoners does not support Trump’s claims.
Almost all the independent research on this question — do immigrants bring more crime? — contradicted Trump in 2015 and continues to do so today as we look at newer studies. One report based on Arizona reaches a different conclusion: that undocumented immigrants do commit crimes at higher rates than U.S. citizens or legal immigrants. But it’s not scientific to extrapolate Arizona’s figures to form nationwide conclusions.
The bottom line is that a great majority of research on this question contradicts Trump’s claim, even in its narrower form focused only on “illegal immigrants.” There is a possibility that Census data on which many of these studies are based could be giving an inaccurate count of who is and is not undocumented. But there is no way to prove it because of the lack of reliable, standardized data from the states, where 90 percent of prisoners are housed. As always, the burden of proof rests with the speaker, so the president once again earns Four Pinocchios.

4672,"Trump offers 'Dreamers' a path to citizenship, wants other immigration curbs""",Reuters,1/26/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration/trump-offers-dreamers-a-path-to-citizenship-wants-other-immigration-curbs-idUSKBN1FE2QX,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is offering a path to citizenship for up to 1.8 million young illegal immigrants but insists on measures that would curb some legal immigration programs and provide a border wall with Mexico, senior White House officials said on Thursday.
The White House offered to more than double the number of “Dreamers” - people brought to the country illegally as children - who would be protected from deportation, describing it as a major concession aimed at attracting enough votes for an immigration deal from Democrats.
But the plan comes with significant strings attached to appeal to Republicans, including requirements to slash family sponsorship of immigrants, tighten border security and provide billions of dollars in funding for a border wall with Mexico that Trump made one of his major campaign promises.
The package was immediately panned by pro-immigration groups, which said the plan was a bad trade-off. It was also slammed by some conservative groups, which decried the expansion of “amnesty” for illegal immigrants.
The head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Democratic Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, said the Trump plan used Dreamers as “bargaining chips for sweeping anti-immigrant policies.”
Early reaction from Republicans in the Senate - where the plan may receive a vote in early February - was positive. Conservative Republican Senator Tom Cotton called the plan “generous and humane, while also being responsible.” Republicans narrowly control the chamber by 51-49 and need Democratic votes to pass legislation.
The fight over protections for Dreamers, which are set to expire in March, was part of the standoff between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that resulted in a three-day government shutdown that ended on Monday.
They agreed to extend funding until Feb. 8, leaving a small window to come to a deal on immigration. Trump’s plan will help provide guidance for those talks, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement.
Negotiations will be tough. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, who has championed the cause of the Dreamers, said the plan put Trump’s “entire hardline immigration agenda - including massive cuts to legal immigration - on the backs of these young people.”
‘HORRENDOUS TRADE-OFF’
Trump, whose tough immigration stance was a key part of his 2016 presidential campaign, said in September he was ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program for Dreamers that was created by Democratic predecessor Barack Obama.
The DACA protections apply to about 700,000 people, but White House officials said there were at least that many illegal immigrants who qualified for the program but did not sign up for it.
Officials said the 1.8 million people could apply to become citizens in 10 to 12 years providing they had jobs and did not commit crimes.
Trump’s plan would require Congress to set up a $25 billion “trust fund” to build a wall on the southern border with Mexico, and invest in better protections at the northern border with Canada.
Congress would have to allocate additional money to border guards and immigration judges, a figure that the Republican president pegged at $5 billion on Wednesday, but which White House officials said was up for further discussion.
The White House also wants Congress to change rules to allow for the rapid deportation of illegal immigrants from countries other than Mexico and Canada who arrive at the U.S. border, the officials said.
White House officials made clear that a deal could not only address DACA and the border wall but must also end a visa lottery program for certain countries and limit family sponsorship of immigrants to spouses and minor children - ending sponsorship for parents, older children and siblings.
Stephen Legomsky, who was chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration, called the plan a “horrendous tradeoff” and predicted Democrats would reject it.
“It offers a one-time citizenship path to innocent Dreamers and expects in return a massive permanent cut to family immigration, the permanent elimination of the entire diversity program, and a huge expenditure for a border wall,” said Legomsky, now at Washington University Law School in St. Louis.
A group of immigrant youth called United We Dream said the deal was “pitting us against our own parents, Black immigrants and our communities.”
Groups that oppose allowing illegal immigrants to remain in the United States also voiced criticism, and urged Congress to take its time.
“While it includes a number of tough immigration enforcement provisions, it includes an amnesty that is more than twice the size of the DACA population,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors restrictions.
HOUSE PATH UNCLEAR
To become law, the measures would also need to pass the House of Representatives, where Republicans have a bigger majority. A senior White House official declined to speculate on whether the plan would pass the chamber.
“I think the House will have an independent vehicle,” the second official said. “We’re not trying to force something on the House.”
Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, a Republican Cuban-American from Miami and longtime advocate of immigration reform, praised Trump for putting forward a “serious proposal.”

Democratic Representative Luis Gutiérrez said, however, that the plan “doesn’t pass the laugh test.
“It would be far cheaper to erect a 50-foot concrete statue of a middle finger and point it towards Latin America, because both a wall and the statue would be equally offensive and equally ineffective,” the Illinois lawmaker said on Twitter."
6572,Trump immigration proposal could provide path to citizenship for 1.8 million in US illegally',Fox News (Online),1/26/2018,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/25/trump-immigration-proposal-could-provide-path-to-citizenship-for-1-8-million-in-us-illegally.html,"The White House Thursday released an immigration plan that would offer a path to citizenship for approximately 1.8 million of the so-called ""Dreamers,"" along with a $25 billion investment in border security -- including for President Trump's long-promised wall.
The White House was expected to provide more details of the president's proposal early next week. But the proposal represents a reversal for Trump and could provoke resistance among his conservative allies.
In September, Trump ended the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which currently covers roughly 690,000 immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.
""We're not looking at citizenship,"" Trump told reporters at the time. ""We're not looking at amnesty. We're looking at allowing people to stay here.""
On Wednesday, however, Trump said he was open to a pathway to citizenship for younger immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as children.
""We're going to morph into it,"" Trump told reporters. ""It's going to happen, at some point in the future, over a period of 10 to 12 years.""
The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute said it believes the largest share of the White House's 1.8 million people who'd be eligible for citizenship -- 1.3 million -- are people who currently meet all of DACA's eligibility requirements. These include years in the U.S., their ages now and when they entered this country, and whether they have a high school or equivalent education.
Another 400,000 are people who'd be eligible for DACA protection but for their education. And 100,000 more are people who are under age 15 --the minimum age allowed for most people requesting protection under the program.
Legal status for the recipients would be revocable for criminal behavior and national security threats, sources familiar with the plan told Fox News, and eventual citizenship would require still-unspecified work and education requirements -- and a finding that the immigrants are of ""good moral character.""
Trump's plan would restrict new family-based immigration to spouses and minor children, doing away with provisions allowing parents, adult siblings and others to enter the country. The sources said it would only end new applications for visas, allowing those already in the pipeline to be processed.
It would also end the diversity visa lottery program, which drew Trump's attention after the New York City truck attack last year, redirecting the allotment annually to bringing down the existing backlog in visa applications.
Trump had deferred to a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers to craft an immigration proposal, saying he would sign whatever they passed. But as talks on Capitol Hill broke down -- in part because of controversy Trump ginned up using vulgar language to describe other countries -- the White House decided to offer its own framework.
The release follows on concerns raised by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that the president had not sufficiently laid out his priorities. One official said the Thursday release represents a plan for the Senate, with the administration expecting a different bill to pass the House.
In a statement, McConnell said the White House plan ""indicates what is necessary for the president to sign a bill into law.""
""I am hopeful that as discussions continue in the Senate on the subject of immigration, Members on both sides of the aisle will look to this framework for guidance as they work towards an agreement,"" McConnell added.
Doug Andres, a spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., echoed the sentiment saying: ""We're grateful for the president showing leadership on this issue and believe his ideas will help us ultimately reach a balanced solution.""
But a spokesman for House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., blasted the plan as part of a ""hateful anti-immigrant agenda.""
Drew Hammill accused White House aide Stephen Miller, a staunch opponent of illegal immigration, of ""trying to ransom the lives of innocent DREAMers for a $25 billion anti-immigrant wish list.""
""The White House strategy of moving the goal posts every time the President isn't paying attention continues to complicate this process,"" he said in a statement.
The president's most loyal media ally, Breitbart News, attacked Trump as ""Amnesty Don."" The conservative group Heritage Action for America said the proposal ""should be a non-starter.""
However, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who played a key role in immigration talks earlier this month, said Trump's proposal was ""generous and humane, while also being responsible.""
""It protects those eligible for DACA, who are here through no fault of their own. But it also will prevent us from ending up back here in five years by securing the border and putting an end to extended-family chain migration.""
Among other Republicans, Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford said he supports the citizenship pathway Trump described Wednesday. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., called Trump's words ""positive"" and said Trump's description ""gives us a better sense"" of his views, but added, ""We have a long way to go yet.""
Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., said the White House framework was ""something that both Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate should be eager to support.
""We all want a good deal,"" Perdue added, ""and here it is.""
Some of Congress' more conservative members seemed unwilling to open the citizenship door for the Dreamers.
""DACA itself didn't have a pathway to citizenship,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who battled Trump in 2016 for the GOP presidential nomination. ""So I think it would be a profound mistake and not consistent with the promises we made to the voters, to enact a pathway to citizenship to DACA recipients or to others who are here illegally.""
Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said he supports a more conservative, more sweeping immigration bill proposed by House members, including House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., which has won strong support from House conservatives. Ryan has promised to push for support for that measure.
Meanwhile, immigration activists blasted the plan. Lorella Praeli, with the American Civil Liberties Union, called it ""a hateful, xenophobic immigration proposal that would slash legal immigration to levels not seen since the racial quotas of the 1920s, eliminate legal immigration channels for African countries, and spend $25 billion for a harmful, wasteful border wall and an increase in Border Patrol and ICE agents. ""

I was at the Museum of American History.” “Before DACA I always felt like I was in between two worlds. I was born in Honduras. But if I were to go back to Honduras, it’s like I’m foreign to them.” “It’s a tug of war. When you’re undocumented, you’re always just aware of the situations, of the locations, who you were talking to, how you are interacting with folks, ensuring that you don’t do anything that will bring attention to you because you live a life of shadows.” “You know, I have been able to accomplish a lot more than when I was undocumented.

""Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fully understands, especially after his humiliating defeat, that if there is no Wall, there is no DACA,"" the president tweeted around 11 p.m. ET. ""We must have safety and security, together with a strong Military, for our great people!""
Earlier Tuesday evening, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley slammed Schumer during an appearance on Fox News' ""Outnumbered Overtime.""
“He comes over here with a phony plan and a fake promise,” Gidley said, referring to Schumer, D-N.Y.
A Schumer aide confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that the leader withdrew his offer of a boost in funding for the president’s proposed border wall. It was initially made during negotiations over the government spending bill with the president last Friday, the aide said.
Schumer’s office says he pulled the wall offer on Sunday.
But Gidley said they didn’t take the offer seriously, saying the Democrat offered less than one-tenth of what was needed to secure the border in his “bogus negotiation.” The administration wants $18 billion for a border wall.
“You can't rescind money you never really offered in the first place,” he said.
After a three-day government shutdown, Democrats agreed to re-open the government Monday after Republicans assured them the Senate would soon consider legislation that would protect the so-called Dreamers.
SCHUMER BASHED BY LEFT OVER SHUTDOWN-ENDING DEAL
During Tuesday’s press briefing at the White House, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the president opposes an immigration proposal brokered by Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois.
“In a bipartisan meeting here at the White House two weeks ago we outlined a path forward on four issues: serious border security, an end to chain migration, the cancellation of the outdated and unsafe visa lottery and a permanent solution to DACA,” Sanders said. “Unfortunately, the Flake-Graham-Durbin agreement does not meet these benchmarks.”

3981,"Democrats withdraw offer to fund Trump's border wall""",Reuters,1/24/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration/democrats-withdraw-offer-to-fund-trumps-border-wall-idUSKBN1FC236,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats said on Tuesday they had withdrawn an offer to fund U.S. President Donald Trump’s border wall, as tough negotiations over the future of young illegal immigrants known as “Dreamers” resumed in the Senate.
A day after the end of a government shutdown linked to wrangling over immigration, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he pulled the offer because of what he said was Trump’s failure to follow through on the outlines of an agreement the two men discussed on Friday.
“So we’re going to have to start on a new basis and the wall offer is off the table,” Schumer told reporters. An aide said the offer was withdrawn on Sunday.
Trump said on Twitter late on Tuesday night: “Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fully understands, especially after his humiliating defeat, that if there is no Wall, there is no DACA. We must have safety and security, together with a strong Military, for our great people!”
The Congressional Hispanic Caucus expressed fears on Tuesday that Republicans in the House of Representatives would pursue a harsh immigration bill written by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte.
The House measure would allow Dreamers to renew their legal status for three years, instead of putting them on a pathway to citizenship, and would call for hiring 10,000 more agents at U.S. borders while shutting down some visa programs and taking other steps to find people who are in the country illegally.
Republican Trump said during the 2016 election campaign Mexico would pay the cost of building a wall along the southwestern border of the United States to keep out illegal immigrants. Mexico has rejected the idea.
As a result, Trump has been forced to ask Congress for U.S. taxpayer funds for the wall. Government estimates are that it could cost more than $21 billion.
With Democrats and many Republicans arguing there are more effective border enforcement tools than a wall, the proposal has become a major sticking point in immigration negotiations, which in turn have complicated talks about funding federal agencies.
The Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, Dick Durbin, asked by a reporter whether Schumer offered Trump $25 billion for the wall in a major concession to the president, did not dispute the figure, but said: “He did it in the context of a negotiation.”

PROTECTING THE ‘DREAMERS’
Democrats have been spearheading an effort to protect about 700,000 young Dreamers after Trump announced in September the end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program instituted by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.
The program, which began in 2012, gave qualified Dreamers, who were brought illegally to the United States as children, temporary protection from deportation and the ability to study and work in the United States.
Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, criticized Schumer for pulling the wall funding offer.
“That basically sets the DACA discussion back,” he told reporters.
Cornyn said there had been discussions of he and Durbin being a “clearing house” for suggestions from senators on legislation to rescue Dreamers from the threat of deportation and provide permanent protections for them.
In agreeing on Monday to end a three-day government shutdown - the first since 2013 - and fund the government until Feb. 8, Senate Democrats got a promise from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he would allow an immigration debate on the Senate floor in the near future.
Durbin said a similar commitment was now needed from Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, where a Dreamer bill would presumably face a much harder path to passage than in the Senate.
The White House on Tuesday rejected the idea that a bipartisan bill sponsored by Durbin and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham could be the core of a solution.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the proposal was “totally unacceptable to the president and should be declared dead on arrival.”

Trump himself has vacillated on immigration between tough rhetoric demanding a U.S. border wall and a softer tone urging a “bill of love” for Dreamers.
“Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans & Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8, but everyone will be trying,” Trump tweeted."
3075,Trump Denies Changing His Position on Border Wall',New York Times (Online News),1/18/2018,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/us/politics/trump-kelly-border-wall.html,"Asked whether he minded Mr. Kelly telling lawmakers he had not been fully informed about immigration, Mr. Trump said: “No, he did not say that. He didn’t say it the way you would like him to say it.”
But according to one person familiar with the president’s thinking, Mr. Trump was livid when he learned that Mr. Kelly had described him as “evolving” in his immigration position. Throughout the evening on Wednesday, Mr. Trump fielded calls from allies who described Mr. Kelly’s comments to Congress as undermining the president, stoking Mr. Trump’s fury.
The president — who never likes it when someone characterizes his thinking — vented his anger to Mr. Kelly and to allies, according to the person familiar with the president’s thinking. It was similar to a moment during the campaign in April of 2016, when Paul Manafort — who had just been hired to the Trump campaign — was caught on tape at a meeting with Republican National Committee members saying of Mr. Trump, “the part he’s been playing is evolving.”
When a president’s chief of staff speaks to members of Congress, it should be a “consistent message,” Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat of Texas, said on Thursday in an interview with CNN. Mr. Cuellar, who attended Wednesday’s meeting with Mr. Kelly, said the inconsistency “makes it hard” to negotiate.
Lawmakers who attended the meeting on Wednesday described Mr. Kelly’s remarks. Representative Luis V. Gutiérrez, a Democrat of Illinois who was at the meeting, said Mr. Kelly told the group that “a 50-foot wall from sea to shining sea isn’t what we’re going to build.”
Mr. Gutiérrez told reporters that Mr. Kelly referenced Mr. Trump’s campaign promises to build a wall and said, “There were statements made about the wall that were not informed statements.”
In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday night, Mr. Kelly defended his comments to the Democratic lawmakers and said, “There’s been an evolutionary process that this president has gone through, as a campaign, and I pointed out to all of the members that were in the room that they all say things during the course of campaigns that may or may not be fully informed.”"

“The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it,” Trump wrote in an early-morning tweet.
The tweet came after lawmakers who met with White House chief of staff John Kelly John Francis KellyMORE told The Washington Post and other news outlets that the top aide said some of Trump’s campaign promises on immigration, including the wall, are “uninformed.”
The Post reported that Kelly told lawmakers some parts of the border do not need a wall and there will be no physical barrier “that Mexico will pay for.”

Trump tweeted that “parts will be, of necessity, see through” and wrote that the wall “was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains, wastelands or tough rivers or water.”
He added that it “will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S.”

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2018
The exchange marks a rare public break between Trump and Kelly, whom the president tapped as chief of staff last summer to bring stability to a White House that had been wracked by chaos.
Kelly’s claim that Trump’s views on immigration have evolved came as Congress struggles to broker a deal on shielding hundreds of thousands of immigrations from deportation.
Those immigrants, who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, benefitted from the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which Trump scrapped last year. The program winds down on March 5.
Trump and Republican lawmakers have said they would support protections for DACA recipients if they are tied to strict border security measures, including wall funding, and sweeping reforms to the nation’s legal immigration system. Democrats have balked at some of those demands.
Kelly echoed his comments during an interview with Fox News, hours after he reportedly first made them during the meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
“He's very definitely changed his attitudes toward the DACA issue and even the wall once we briefed him,” Kelly said, referring to Trump
Kelly said he told the Hispanic lawmakers that Trump has “evolved in the way he's looked at things” and that all politicians “say things during the course of campaigns that may or may not be fully informed.”
“Campaigning to governing are two different things, and this president has been very, very flexible in terms of what is within the realm of the possible,” he added.
Kelly’s comments may have irked the president because they suggested Trump did not know enough about border security during the campaign, when he promised to build a “great, great wall on our southern border” and “make Mexico pay for that wall.”
The wall was one of Trump’s core campaign promises, and he has repeatedly pledged to fulfill it as president. Kelly’s comments, however, acknowledged that campaign promises might not always be completely fulfilled.
Trump has previously chafed at aides who have been framed as wise men keeping him on the right path. He was reportedly angered by a Time magazine cover last year that cast his former chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, as “The Great Manipulator”
The president also has not been afraid to publicly undercut comments made by his senior staff. He tweeted last summer that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Rex Wayne TillersonMcEnany: Trump likes to hire people with 'countervailing viewpoints' Bolton book shows nastiness rules at Trump White House The Memo: Bolton exposé makes Trump figure of mockery MORE was “wasting his time” by seeking talks with North Korea over its nuclear-weapons program.
Kelly has been one of Trump’s go-to people in dealing with Congress with regard to a DACA fix. He formerly led the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the nation’s immigration system, and was the top U.S. military commander in Latin America.
Despite Kelly’s efforts, lawmakers have been frustrated with Trump’s shifting position on DACA and a broader immigration deal.
Last week, he hosted Republican and Democratic lawmakers at the White House for an extraordinary public negotiating session, during which he said he would sign virtually any immigration bill they put on his desk.
But he helped throw a wrench in the talks by reportedly making comments about ""shithole countries"" during a meeting where a bipartisan group of lawmakers offered a compromise proposal. Trump later called the measure “horrible” on border security.
“We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country,” Trump tweeted Thursday morning. “We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico, now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall, there is no Deal!""

“There’s been an evolutionary process that this president has gone through,” Kelly said in an interview with Fox News host Bret Baier, pointing out that Trump had “very definitely changed his attitude” towards DACA recipients and the wall.
But Trump pushed back on Twitter against the suggestion that he had evolved on the wall.
“The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it,” Trump said.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2018
He explained that parts of the wall would be “see-through” and that it was never meant to stretch across the whole 2,000-mile border where there were already natural barriers.
Kelly said that he and border experts told Trump that 800 miles of wall would “suffice” which included 600 miles of existing fencing.
“He has evolved in the way he’s looked at things,” Kelly said. “Campaign to governing are two different things and this president has been very, very flexible in terms of what is within the realm of the possible.”
Kelly also suggested that the wall would not be paid “directly” by Mexico, something that Trump also corrected.
“The Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S.,” he wrote. “The $20 billion dollar Wall is ‘peanuts’ compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S. NAFTA is a bad joke!”

5627,"DACA Renewal Applications Resume After Judge's Ruling""",Townhall,1/14/2018,,,https://townhall.com/tipsheet/timothymeads/2018/01/14/daca-renewal-applications-resume-after-judges-ruling-n2434382,"Yesterday, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it would resume the application renewal process for illegal aliens seeking protection from deportation after being brought into the United States as children. These “Dreamers”, as they are known in some circles, had previously been shielded from deportation under President Barack Obama’s executive order known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA).
On Tuesday January 9th, U.S. District Judge William Allsup ruled that President Donald J. Trump did not have the legal authority to rescind some parts of the program. In September 2017, Trump pledged to end DACA altogether unless Democrats and Republicans in Congress could craft a bill addressing serious legal and immigration issues that he could sign. Allsup ruled that the DHS must accept applications from individuals seeking to renew their ""Dreamer"" status, but did not have to accept new applications from individuals applying for the first time.
""These individuals had submitted substantial personal identifying information to the government, paid hefty fees and planned their lives according to the dictates of DACA,"" the Judge wrote. ""The administrative record includes no consideration to the disruption a rescission would have on the lives of DACA recipients, let alone their families, employers and employees, schools and communities.""
He added that the government's arguments were ""arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion.""
After hearing Allsup’s decision, the White House strongly condemned what some may say is judicial overreach. ""An issue of this magnitude must go through the normal legislative process,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. ""President Trump is committed to the rule of law, and will work with members of both parties to reach a permanent solution that corrects the unconstitutional actions taken by the last administration.""
And President Trump tweeted on Wednesday, ""It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.”
On Sunday morning, President Trump once again took to Twitter to slam America’s immigration policy. ""DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don’t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military,” he proclaimed.
Moments the president later called for a merit based immigration system.
“I, as President, want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again, people coming in through a system based on MERIT. No more Lotteries! #AMERICA FIRST,” he added.
So far, Republicans and Democrats have not been able to compromise on an immigration reform bill that would also address the problem of illegal aliens and ""Dreamers"" currently in the United States."

The Department of Homeland Security says it will once again accept renewal requests from recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in response to a court order.
""Until further notice, and unless otherwise provided in this guidance, the DACA policy will be operated on the terms in place before it was rescinded on Sept. 5, 2017,"" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a part of DHS, wrote on its website Saturday.
The Obama administration began the program in 2012, which enabled certain young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children to apply for work permits and protection from deportation. As of September, about 700,000 people are currently protected under the program.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in September that the Trump administration would wind down the DACA program. The administration said it was executive overreach and called on Congress to come up with a solution to the status of DACA recipients, also called DREAMers.
But a federal judge in San Francisco halted that plan late Tuesday and ordered the administration to resume processing DACA renewals while a lawsuit against the September decision moves forward.
The statement from USCIS says people who have already been granted deportation deferral under DACA can request renewal, but the agency will not accept new requests from people who have never received deferred action before. If someone's DACA expired on or after Sept. 5, 2016, that person may file a renewal request, the agency says; people who received DACA that expired before then can file a new DACA request.
President Trump held a meeting with lawmakers on Tuesday about passing new legislation to allow the DREAMers to stay in the country, though he has pushed for funding for a wall with Mexico to be part of any immigration policy overhaul. He also received widespread criticism this past week after reports that he referred to immigrants from certain countries using a vulgar slur."

In his ruling, Judge Alsup laid out a road map for the government that officials appeared to follow. He said that previous beneficiaries of DACA, known as Dreamers, must be allowed to renew their status in the program, though the government would not be required to accept new applications from immigrants who had not previously submitted one.
On Sunday morning, Mr. Trump blamed Democrats for preventing progress on a legislative deal that would permanently legalize the young immigrants and give them an eventual path to citizenship in exchange for tougher border security and enforcement measures.
The president criticized Democratic lawmakers, some of whom have suggested that they will not support efforts to fund the government by a deadline later this week unless Congress passes the DACA legislation.
“DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don’t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla.
In a second tweet, Mr. Trump said that immigration legislation should include an end to the diversity visa lottery system, in which the State Department encourages diversity in immigration by holding a lottery for those wanting to come to the United States.
The president has criticized the program as a threat to the country’s security even though people selected are screened in the same ways that other immigrants are. Mr. Trump has also said that the program undermines efforts by the administration to allow immigrants who have skills that will be beneficial to the United States.
“I, as President, want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again, people coming in through a system based on MERIT,” he said. “No more Lotteries! #AMERICA FIRST.”"

U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled the Obama-era program must remain in place while litigation plays out.
Alsup, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, also said the program should continue, allowing those already approved for the program to renew their DACA protections and work permits.
New applications will not be allowed to be submitted under the ruling, however.
""Dreamers' lives were thrown into chaos when the Trump Administration tried to terminate the DACA program without obeying the law,"" said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. ""Today's ruling is a huge step in the right direction.""
""America is and has been home to Dreamers who courageously came forward, applied for DACA and did everything the federal government asked of them,"" he added. ""They followed DACA's rules, they succeeded in school, at work and in business, and they have contributed in building a better America. We will fight at every turn for their rights and opportunities so they may continue to contribute to America.""
But the Department of Justice said the ruling doesn’t change the facts about the program.
""DACA was implemented unilaterally after Congress declined to extend these benefits to this same group of illegal aliens. As such, it was an unlawful circumvention of Congress, and was susceptible to the same legal challenges that effectively ended DAPA,"" the DOJ said in a statement.
During Tuesday’s bipartisan immigration meeting, President Trump said he would support a plan those in the room came up with, adding that he'd be open to taking on his political base in order to support a bipartisan agreement.
“I’ll take the heat off both the Democrats and the Republicans,” he said.
UPDATE: The White House and President Trump blasted the judge's ruling.
""We find this decision to be outrageous, especially in light of the President's successful bipartisan meeting with House and Senate members at the White House on the same day,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.
""An issue of this magnitude must go through the normal legislative process,"" she added. ""President Trump is committed to the rule of law, and will work with members of both parties to reach a permanent solution that corrects the unconstitutional actions taken by the last administration.""
Trump also weighed in.
""It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts,"" he said on Twitter."

On Tuesday, a San Francisco federal district court judge enjoined—that is, blocked—Trump’s attack on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. This injunction is temporary, in place until the court rules on the substance—or the merits—of the challenge to Trump’s plan to terminate DACA.
The good news is by granting a preliminary injunction the judge has indicated that he thinks DACA’s backers are likely to prevail. The bad news is that the injunction isn’t complete.
A federal judge in San Francisco issued a nationwide preliminary injunction Tuesday blocking the Trump administration’s decision to phase out a program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation. The injunction by U.S. District Judge William Alsup says those protections must remain in place for the nearly 690,000 immigrants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program while a legal challenge to ending the Obama-era program proceeds. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the decision to terminate the program on Sept. 5 and said no renewal applications would be accepted after Oct. 5. Under the administration’s plan, permits that expired after March 5 could not be renewed. But Alsup ruled that while the lawsuit is pending, anyone who had DACA status when the program was rescinded Sept. 5 can renew it, officials said.
The White House is in a rage over yet another defeat in court. (Granted, the threshold is low.)

As a result, DACA recipients who failed to renew their status by last year’s deadline will have a chance to submit renewal applications. The decision does not, however, allow new applications to be submitted.

The White House's third attempt at the travel ban targeted foreigners from six Muslim-majority countries, Venezuela, and North Korea.
Rather than take apart the entire ban, however, three members of the 9th Circuit ruled that only the prohibitions on ""foreign nationals who have a bona fide relationship"" within the United States should be stopped.

A three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said Trump had exceeded his authority in ordering that more than 150 million nationals of predominantly Muslim countries be barred from entering the United States.
The court faulted the president for failing to make a “legally sufficient” finding that entry of those barred would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States.”
Trump’s order “nullified” a federal immigration law passed by Congress and overrode “broad swaths of immigration laws that Congress has used its considered judgment to enact,” the court said.

The 9th Circuit, limiting an injunction against the ban by a Honolulu-based federal judge, said it should not be enforced against those who have a “bona fide relationship” to a person or entity in the United States. Those would include people with close family in the United States or a formal relationship with an entity, such as a university or corporation.
However, the Supreme Court this month ruled the president’s full travel ban could go into effect while legal appeals are weighed in lower courts.
Trump issued the ban in September, after two earlier efforts to restrict travelers were overturned by federal courts. The current version targets those coming to the United States from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.

Under the policy being considered, families could be separated, with parents being kept in detention facilities as they await deportation while children would be kept under protective custody at shelters for juveniles or with an approved sponsor.
The measure is among those being considered by Trump administration officials to curb illegal border crossings, especially those involving young children.

The proposed plan means families could face separation because parents would be held at detention facilities prior to being deported and their children would remain under protective custody at juvenile shelters. Alternatively, they would remain with an approved sponsor.

4446,Trump Administration Considers Tearing Families Apart In New Immigration Crackdown',HuffPost,12/22/2017,,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-family-separation-immigration-crackdown_us_5a3cfc08e4b0b0e5a7a19c6d,"In a renewed push to clamp down on the influx of illegal crossings along the southern U.S. border, the Trump administration is reportedly weighing a policy that would separate parents from their children in detention centers.
The measure could also penalize migrants who live in the U.S. illegally and try to bring their children into the country, The Washington Post first reported Thursday.
Families apprehended at the border have historically been detained together. This new policy, according to The New York Times, would place parents in adult detention centers and children either in separate shelters or in the care of “sponsors.”
The new Department of Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen hasn’t yet given her official approval, the Times reported. But the White House is on board, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement has approved the policy.
A DHS official said the agency has spent the year reviewing “procedural, policy, regulatory and legislative” changes to address illegal immigration. “The administration is committed to using all legal tools at its disposal to secure our nation’s borders and as a result we are continuing to review additional policy options.”
While DHS wouldn’t confirm or deny whether this specific policy had been reviewed, acting press secretary Tyler Houlton did say the agency is exploring “all possible measures” to protect children.
“It’s cruel for parents to place the lives of their children in the hands of transnational criminal organizations and smugglers who have zero respect for human life and often abuse or abandon children,” he said in a statement.
Immigration officials floated this type of draconian tactic in March, reasoning that it could sway people not to cross the border illegally, but never moved forward with the proposal. The decision may have been tied to a drop in illegal immigration in the first few months of Donald Trump’s presidency.
Then-DHS secretary John Kelly said the agency would only separate people in circumstances that presented a danger to the child.
People have the right to seek asylum and it is fully within U.S. and international law. Jen Smyers, Church World Service
Illegal border crossings then shot up in the second half of 2017. Official statistics show a 45 percent increase in family units and a 26 percent increase in unaccompanied children between October and November.
Yet some families have still been separated and prosecuted for improper entry, The Houston Chronicle found. The Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project, a legal service provider in Arizona, said it had identified 155 cases of family separation as of late October 2017. Lawyers have argued that the practice is unconstitutional, while the administration has repeated the claim that separation is sometimes necessary to protect children from smugglers.
Jose Demar Fuentes, for instance, entered the U.S. on Nov. 12 with a 1-year-old boy who authorities couldn’t confirm was his son due to a lack of identification documents, ICE said in a statement. Authorities placed the child in the care of the Department of Health and Human Services, while Fuentes was put in a detention center.
“Historically, some criminal smuggling organizations have paired non-relative children and adults with each other to minimize the chance of being detained if caught being smuggled across the border,” said ICE spokeswoman Liz Johnson.
Advocacy groups decried the possible measure.
“Formalizing a policy of forcibly separating families seeking asylum in the U.S. is inhumane, traumatic, and unnecessary and will not make America any safer,” said Michelle Brané, director of the Migrant Rights and Justice program at the Women’s Refugee Commission. “Such a policy flies in the face of domestic and international child welfare and refugee principles and laws and would even further undermine U.S. obligations to ensure policies protecting family unity.”
As we prepare to celebrate Christmas, we are painfully aware that these families are seeking safety just as Joseph, Mary, and the infant Jesus did long ago.” Jen Smyers, Church World Service
Jen Smyers, the director of policy and advocacy for the Church World Service’s refugee resettlement program, told HuffPost that the policy proposal is “inhumane.”
“Donald Trump’s war on immigrants has reached a sad new low. Separating families who are fleeing gang violence is unconscionable. And yet we find ourselves in the position of once again issuing a statement that we are against proposals that are clearly inhumane — just days before Christmas no less,” she said in a statement. “People have the right to seek asylum and it is fully within U.S. and international law. Especially as we prepare to celebrate Christmas, we are painfully aware that these families are seeking safety just as Joseph, Mary, and the infant Jesus did long ago.”
“The United States should not be in the business of separating children from their parents to fulfill some immoral campaign promise,” the statement continued. “CWS urges the administration to allow these families to have their case for asylum fully considered, and we stand ready to help them through legal services, materials goods, and solidarity through advocacy for their protection.”"

(CNN) The United States notified the United Nations that it will no longer take part in the global compact on migration, saying it undermines the nation's sovereignty.

It calls for the negotiation of a global compact on migration, which is expected to be adopted next year.

In a statement released Saturday, United States Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said the country’s participation in the Global Compact on Migration was incompatible with President Trump’s immigration policies.
""[Our] decisions on immigration policies must always be made by Americans and Americans alone,"" the statement reads. ""We will decide how best to control our borders and who will be allowed to enter our country. The global approach in the New York Declaration is simply not compatible with U.S. sovereignty.""
According to a report in Foreign Policy, Haley had wanted the U.S. to stay in the pact but was “overruled by the president,” diplomatic sources said.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson defended the administration’s decision, arguing it was not an isolationist move but a defense of the U.S.’s power to determine who crosses its borders.
“While we will continue to engage on a number of fronts at the United Nations, in this case, we simply cannot in good faith support a process that could undermine the sovereign right of the United States to enforce our immigration laws and secure our borders,” he said in a statement on Sunday.
The global pact in question was birthed September 2016, when the 196 U.N. member countries voted unanimously to adopt the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, a nonbinding declaration with a goal to enhance international cooperation in dealing with present and future waves of immigration. The declaration was made up of commitments designed to protect migrants’ human rights, enhance international border security cooperation and further prevent governments from detaining child immigrants. (Newsweek)
U.N.'s President of the General Assembly Miroslav Lajcák expressed regret over the U.S.’s decision, saying in a statement that no country ""can manage international migration on its own.""
""The role of the United States in this process is critical as it has historically and generously welcomed people from all across the globe and remains home to the largest number of international migrants in the world,"" the statement reads.

3447,Cards Against Humanity Is Trying To Sabotage Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Border Wall Construction',The Daily Caller,11/15/2017,,,http://dailycaller.com/2017/11/15/cards-against-humanity-is-trying-to-sabotage-trumps-border-wall-construction/,"A company behind a popular card game is trying to sabotage President Donald Trump’s plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border by purchasing up portions of land in that long horizontal area, and offering potential customers a cut.
Known as “a party game for horrible people,” Cards Against Humanity is asking for $15 from visitors to its site in a holiday promotion claiming that in return they’ll receive “six surprises.”
One of those gifts, according to the company, is a formal opportunity to buy a plot of land on or right near the border and be covered by legal representation specializing in eminent domain — rendering it not a surprise at all. The goal for the company is “to make it as time-consuming and expensive as possible for the wall to get built.”
“Donald Trump is a preposterous golem who is afraid of Mexicans,” reads the website’s promotion called “Cards Against Humanity Saves America.”
Ironically, despite the company’s sympathy for immigrants and foreigners, it says in its Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section that if a would-be customer doesn’t live in U.S. or Canada, they can’t sign up.
“No. This is ‘Cards Against Humanity Saves America,’ not ‘Cards Against Humanity Saves The Dumb Country You Live In,'” the company’s answer reads.
Nevertheless, the company says “America will be saved,” specifically from “injustice, lies, racism, the whole enchilada” if people send $15.
The jabs at Trump and his administration are aplenty. The business admits that “we’re liars, just like the president.” Furthermore, surprises don’t contain sexual content “or footage of Donald Trump watching Russian prostitutes urinate on a bed Obama slept in,” according to the company.
When asking in the FAQ section of the website “Why don’t you just stick to card games?” and not get political, the company retorts in typical sassy fashion: “Why don’t you stick to seeing how many Hot Wheels cars you can fit up your asshole?” (RELATED: In Strange Move, DNC Knocks Trump For Lack Of Progress On Border Wall)
All 150,000 slots to sign up for the peculiar gifts sold out within the first day.

Yet, its latest promotional stunt — a sick burn on President Donald Trump's border policies — reveals that it very well may be a force for good.
""Donald Trump is a preposterous golem who is afraid of Mexicans. He is so afraid that he wants to build a twenty-billion dollar wall that everyone knows will accomplish nothing,"" Cards Against Humanity explained on its website. ""So we’ve purchased a plot of vacant land on the border and retained a law firm specializing in eminent domain to make it as time-consuming and expensive as possible for the wall to get built.""

Customers buying into the company's new promotion will each become property owners of a sliver of this land, making a government takeover of it that much more difficult.
There is, naturally, a commercial angle here. For customers who were willing to spend $15, the company offered five other ""America-saving surprises"" that would be shipped to them throughout the month of December. The past tense is used here, as the offer has already sold out. Indeed, the effort has already raised $2 million to fight the border wall.
The company wouldn't elaborate on the nature of the surprise gifts, saying instead that ""The nature of a surprise is that it surprises you when it occurs."" Fair enough. Still, it assured customers that the surprises would ""contain no sexual content, graphic violence, or footage of Donald Trump watching Russian prostitutes urinate on a bed Obama slept in."" Good to know.

As well, its website included a promotional video that followed very much the mold of ""American Experience"" documentaries, adding regular PBS narrator Peter Coyote for flair. Featuring images of the far-right Charlottesville demonstrators, global warming, Trump's bad hair (with Jimmy Fallon obsequiously tousling it) and anti-Black Lives Matter protests, it captures with nostalgia of the moment Cards Against Humanity ""saved America,"" in the past tense.
Trolling Trump isn't new for the company. Past expansion decks and products have been themed to highlight his many faults and, during the 2016 election, Cards Against Humanity funneled proceeds from the sales of similar packs to Hillary Clinton's campaign.
While it's Trump's legislative incompetence that makes it rather unlikely that he'll ever actually be able to build his much-touted wall and not the company's strategy, it is still theoretically possible that Cards Against Humanity's decision to purchase border land could become more than just a gimmick. Fingers crossed on that.

In Maryland, U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang ruled late Tuesday that the travel ban continues to have the same problems, and violate the same constitutional principles, as previous versions of the ban. Despite tweaks made by the administration, Chuang ruled that it still constituted a “Muslim ban” that violates the Constitution’s protections against religious discrimination.
Earlier in the day in Hawaii, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson struck down the ban on different grounds, arguing it violates a federal law that prohibits discrimination based on nationality. Watson said Trump overstepped his legal authority by banning 150 million people from countries targeted in the ban, and that the law does not give him “unbridled discretion to do as he pleases.”
The two rulings combined provide opponents of the ban with multiple legal attacks as the cases make their way through the appeals process.
“They demonstrate the breathe of legal problems that the administration is facing as it tries again and again to impose the ban,” said Omar Jadwat, an ACLU attorney involved in the Maryland case. “They really undermine how any way you look at it, they lose.”
The White House insists that will not be the case. Both judges who ruled Tuesday were appointed by former president Barack Obama. And for all the legal wrangling over the travel ban during the past nine months, the Supreme Court has not yet fully weighed in.
When it does, the high court will have Trump’s nominee — Justice Neil Gorsuch — on the bench, meaning the more conservative court could end up saving the travel ban for Trump.
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday that she was, “confident that the judiciary will ultimately uphold the president’s lawful and necessary action and swiftly restore its vital protections for the safety of the American people.”
At issue is Trump's third attempt to implement a travel ban set to begin Wednesday. The ban would block specific travelers from five of the original nations cited in Trump's first ban issued in January — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen — along with Chad, North Korea and Venezuela.
Iraq and Sudan were subtracted from the list in March and September, respectively.
Watson, issuing a nationwide block against the travel ban, said the measure was ""simultaneously overbroad and underinclusive"" because it targets entire countries rather than dangerous individuals. Watson ruled the new ban fails to show that nationality alone makes a person a greater security risk to the U.S.
“The categorical restrictions on entire populations of men, women and children, based upon nationality, are a poor fit for the issues regarding the sharing of ‘public-safety and terrorism-related information’ that the president identifies,” Watson wrote.
Watson's ruling affects only the six majority-Muslim countries and does not include North Korea and Venezuela. But few people are affected by the ban in those countries.

Chuang, in his ruling a few hours later, said the president's own words make clear the focus is not on national security but on instituting a ban against Muslims. The judge said the administration had “not shown that national security cannot be maintained without an unprecedented eight-country travel ban.”
Chuang's ruling was more limited. It prohibits the administration from enforcing the ban against people who can prove they have a ""bona fide"" — or good faith — relationship with U.S. persons or entities, such as businesses or universities.
In using that wording, the judge followed guidance from the Supreme Court over the summer, when it allowed the Trump administration to implement a scaled-back version of an earlier travel ban. The court dismissed that case after Trump issued the latest version.
The Trump administration continues defending the ban, arguing that a president has broad authority to restrict immigration in the name of national security.
The administration points to a section of federal law that allows a president to bar admission to ""any aliens or of any class of alien"" that he declares are ""detrimental to the interests of the United States."" And it says the latest version of the travel ban is a carefully constructed measure implemented after a thorough review by the departments of Homeland Security, State, Defense and Justice.
The Justice Department has said it will appeal Watson's ruling."
4259,"Second judge issues halt to Trump\xe2\x80\x99s travel ban, rules on \xe2\x80\x98extreme vetting\xe2\x80\x99'",Washington Times,10/18/2017,,,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/oct/18/second-judge-issues-halt-revised-travel-ban/,"A federal judge in Maryland added a new legal blockade to President Trump’s travel ban early Wednesday, ruling that the White House’s third attempt at “extreme vetting” is still poisoned by the president’s campaign-season “religious animus” toward Muslims.
The ruling by Judge Theodore D. Chuang, an Obama appointee to the bench, came just hours after another Obama-appointed judge in Hawaii issued a similar injunction.
Both judges have said Mr. Trump’s attempt to severely curtail admission of visitors and would-be immigrants from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen is likely illegal.
They have, however, allowed restrictions to go into effect for North Korea and Venezuela, two non-Muslim countries.
Judge Chuang, like his Hawaii colleague, had ruled previous versions of the travel ban illegal, and said little has changed in Mr. Trump’s effort to revive the policy with an updated and more supported plan, which the president laid out in a proclamation last month.
“The proclamation’s ban generally resembles President Trump’s earlier description of the Muslim ban,” Judge Chuang wrote in his 91-page ruling.
He said the fact that the current list of eight countries subject to severe restrictions is similar to the previous list of six suggests little has changed.
The earlier ban applied to Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The new list, which came after months of study by the Homeland Security and State departments of nearly 200 countries’ level of cooperation in information-sharing, drops Sudan and adds Chad, North Korea and Venezuela.
The ruling is likely to be quickly appealed.
Administration officials were already working on their appeal of the Hawaii ruling.
The Supreme Court had been slated to hear arguments on the earlier version of the travel ban last week, but after Mr. Trump’s revisions in September they called off the hearing, saying the lower courts needed to evaluate the new policy.
While Tuesday’s ruling affects the country-specific travel ban, another part of the original executive order — a 120-pause on refugee admissions — remains mostly in effect, with some court-ordered exceptions.
The 120-day period expires at the end of this month, and analysts are waiting to see whether Mr. Trump tries to extend the pause. He’s already slashed the overall refugee target from 110,000 people in 2017 to 45,000 in 2018.

6596,"Second judge rules against latest travel ban, saying Trump\xe2\x80\x99s own words show it was aimed at Muslims'",Washington Post,10/18/2017,,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/second-judge-rules-against-latest-travel-ban-saying-trumps-own-words-show-it-was-aimed-at-muslims/2017/10/18/5ecdaa44-b3ed-11e7-9e58-e6288544af98_story.html,"A federal judge in Maryland early Wednesday issued a second halt on the latest version of President Trump's entry ban, asserting that the president's own comments on the campaign trail and on Twitter convinced him that the directive was akin to an unconstitutional ban on Muslims.
U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang issued a somewhat-less-complete halt on the ban than his counterpart in Hawaii did a day earlier. Chuang blocked the administration only from enforcing the directive on those with a ""bona fide"" relationship with a person or entity in the United States, such as family members or some type of professional or other engagement in the United States.
[Syrian family fears reunion would be out of reach under Trump travel ban]
But in some ways, Chuang's ruling was more personally cutting to Trump, as he said the president's own words cast his latest attempt to impose an entry blockade as the ""inextricable re-animation of the twice-enjoined Muslim ban.""
Omar Jadwat, director of the Immigrants' Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union and represented those suing in Maryland over the ban, said: ""Like the two versions before it, President Trump's latest travel ban is still a Muslim ban at its core. And like the two before it, this one is going down to defeat in the courts.""
The third iteration of Trump's ban on U.S. entry by certain foreign nationals had been set to go fully into effect early Wednesday, barring various types of travelers who are citizens of Syria, Libya, Iran, Yemen, Chad, Somalia, North Korea and Venezuela. Even before Chuang's ruling, though, a federal judge in Hawaii blocked the ban — at least temporarily — for all of the countries except North Korea and Venezuela.
That judge, Derrick K. Watson, prohibited the administration from applying the measure to any citizen of the six countries, not just those with a ""bona fide"" U.S. tie. But his ruling did not address whether Trump's intent in imposing the directive was to discriminate against Muslims. He said the president had merely exceeded the authority Congress had given him in immigration law.
The Justice Department already had vowed to appeal Watson's ruling, which the White House said ""undercuts the President's efforts to keep the American people safe and enforce minimum security standards for entry into the United States."" Both Watson's temporary restraining order and Chuang's preliminary injunction are also interim measures, meant to maintain the status quo as the parties continue to argue the case.
[Federal judge blocks Trump’s third travel ban]
The administration had cast the new measure as necessary for national security and as a step that was taken only after officials conducted an extensive review of the information they needed to vet those proposing to come to the United States. Those countries that were either unwilling or unable to produce such information even after negotiations, officials have said, were included on the banned list.
""These restrictions are vital to ensuring that foreign nations comply with the minimum security standards required for the integrity of our immigration system and the security of our Nation,"" the White House said in a statement after Watson's ruling.
Like Watson's order, Chuang's 91-page ruling also found that Trump had exceeded his authority under immigration law, but only to a degree.
Trump's order — which has ""no specified end date and no requirement of renewal"" — violated a nondiscrimination provision in the law in that it blocked entry to the United States on the basis of nationality, Chuang wrote.
But Chuang said he could not determine, as Watson did, that Trump had violated a different part of federal immigration law requiring him to find that entry of certain nonimmigrant travelers would be ""detrimental"" to U.S. interests before blocking them.
Chuang instead based much of his ruling on his assessment that Trump intended to ban people of the Islamic faith, and thus his order had run afoul of the Establishment Clause in the First Amendment to the Constitution. When Trump was a presidential candidate in December 2015, Chuang wrote, he had promised a ""complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,"" and all of his comments since then seemed to indicate his various entry bans were meant to fulfill that promise.
After his second ban was blocked, Chuang wrote, Trump described the measure as a ""watered down version"" of his initial order, adding, ""we ought go back to the first one and go all the way, which is what I wanted to do in the first place."" The president had then revoked and replaced his first travel ban, which had also been held up in court.
In August, with courts still weighing the second version, Chuang noted that Trump ""endorsed what appears to be an apocryphal story involving General John J. Pershing and a purported massacre of Muslims with bullets dipped in a pig's blood, advising people to 'study what General Pershing . . . did to terrorists when caught.' ""
[Trump said to study Gen. Pershing. Here’s what the president got wrong.]
In September, as authorities worked on a new directive, Trump wrote on Twitter that ""the travel ban into the United States should be far larger, tougher and more specific — but stupidly, that would not be politically correct!""
Chuang had pressed challengers at a hearing this week on what the government would have to do to make the new ban legal, and he noted in his ruling that the new directive had changed from the previous iterations. The government, for example, had undertaken a review process before issuing the new measure and had added two non-majority-Muslim countries to the banning list.
But Chuang wrote that he was unconvinced that government officials had simply relied on the results of their review and instead believed they made ""certain subjective determinations that resulted in a disproportionate impact on majority-Muslim nations."" He wrote that the government offered ""no evidence, even in the form of classified information submitted to the Court, showing an intelligence-based terrorism threat justifying a ban on entire nationalities,"" and he asserted that even the new measure ""generally resembles President Trump's earlier description of the Muslim ban.""
""The 'initial' announcement of the Muslim ban, offered repeatedly and explicitly through President Trump's own statements, forcefully and persuasively expressed his purpose in unequivocal terms,"" Chuang wrote.
The suits in federal court in Maryland had been brought by 23 people and seven organizations that said they would be harmed by the new ban.

5308,"Trump administration releases hard-line immigration principles, threatening deal on \xe2\x80\x98dreamers\xe2\x80\x99'",Washington Post,10/9/2017,,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/10/08/trump-administration-releases-hard-line-immigration-principles-threatening-deal-on-dreamers/,"The demands were quickly denounced by Democratic leaders in Congress who had hoped to forge a deal with President Trump to protect younger immigrants, known as “dreamers,” who were brought to the United States illegally as children. Trump announced plans last month to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, an Obama-era program that had provided two-year work permits to the dreamers that Trump called “unconstitutional.”
AD

About 690,000 immigrants are enrolled in DACA, but their work permits are set to begin expiring in March. Trump had met last month with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and agreed to try to strike a deal, worrying immigration hawks who feared that Trump would support a bill that would allow dreamers to gain full legal status without asking for significant border security measures in return.
The list released by the administration, however, would represent a major tightening of immigration laws. Cuts to legal immigration also are included. And, while Democrats have called for a path to citizenship for all dreamers, a group estimated at more than 1.5 million, a White House aide said Sunday night the administration is ""not interested in granting a path to citizenship"" in a deal to preserve the DACA program.
“The administration can't be serious about compromise or helping the Dreamers if they begin with a list that is anathema to the Dreamers, to the immigrant community and to the vast majority of Americans,” Schumer and Pelosi said in a joint statement Sunday evening. “We told the President at our meeting that we were open to reasonable border security measures ... but this list goes so far beyond what is reasonable. This proposal fails to represent any attempt at compromise.”
AD

In a conference call with reporters, White House aides described the proposals as necessary to protect public safety and jobs for American-born workers, which was a centerpiece of Trump's campaign. The president has moved to tighten border security through executive orders, including curbs on immigration and refugees from some majority-Muslim nations and an increase in deportations.
The number of immigrants who have attempted to enter the country illegally across the Mexican border has decreased sharply since Trump took office.
Democrats had hoped that Trump, who had equivocated over the DACA program before deciding to terminate it in the face of a legal challenge from Texas, would be open to crafting a narrow legislative deal to protect the dreamers. But White House aides emphasized that they expect Congress to include the principles released Sunday in any package deal, a nonstarter for Democrats and some moderate Republicans.
AD

""These findings outline reforms that must be included as part of any legislation addressing the status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients,"" Trump wrote in a letter to Congress. ""Without these reforms, illegal immigration and chain migration, which severely and unfairly burden American workers and taxpayers, will continue without end.""
Immigration hard-liners expressed support for the administration's immigration proposals. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) praised the administration for “a serious proposal” and said that “we cannot fix the DACA problem without fixing all of the issues that led to the underlying problem of illegal immigration in the first place.”
Trump had said several times over the past month that he did not expect a DACA deal to include funding for a border wall, emphasizing that the money could be included in separate legislation. But ensuring funding for the wall, which is projected to cost more than $25 billion, is the top priority on the list. White House aides declined to specify during the call how much money the president would expect from Congress.

Despite the White House's calls for the complete construction of a southern border wall and the support of some ardent conservatives in Congress, several GOP lawmakers from border states have expressed skepticism about such projects in the past. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), the second-ranking Republican, has introduced legislation that would fund only partial wall construction and mostly renovations of existing barriers.
Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a frequent sparring partner of Trump's, has also cast doubt on building a wall, saying that such barriers would require accounting for the flow of rivers that run north and south across the two countries.
Others, including Rep. Will Hurd (R-Tex.), whose south Texas district includes more than 800 miles of border, has proposed using technology -- not brick and mortar -- to track the border for potentially illegal crossings.

In its principles, the Trump administration also is proposing changes aimed at reducing the flow of unaccompanied minors from Central America, tens of thousands of whom have entered the United States illegally in recent years. Immigrant rights groups have said the minors, as well as women and families, have fled gang violence and other dangers in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
Under current law, minors who arrive from noncontiguous nations are afforded greater protections than those from Mexico and Canada, but the Trump administration is proposing to treat them all the same in a bid to be able to deport the minors more quickly. Such proposals will probably face fierce resistance from Democrats and human rights groups.
The administration also has sought to increase pressure on sanctuary cities, which refuse, in some cases, to cooperate with federal immigration agents seeking personal information about undocumented immigrants who've committed other crimes in their jurisdictions. Under the immigration priorities released Sunday, the administration is proposing that Congress withhold federal grants to such jurisdictions and that it clarify the authority of state and local jurisdictions to honor detainers issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“There is no justification for releasing a public safety threat back into the public,” said Thomas Homan, the acting director of ICE. “We will not stop illegal immigration unless we stop the pull factors that are driving it. ... Entering this country illegally is a crime but there are no consequences for sneaking past the border or overstaying visas.”
Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.), vice chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said that “Congress should reject this warped, anti-immigrant policy wish list. The White House wants to use dreamers as bargaining chips to achieve the administration’s deportation and detention goals.”
Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), a longtime advocate for comprehensive immigration reform, in an interview called Trump's proposals “an extension of the white supremacist agenda.” He said it is “fanciful thinking that you can sit down with a man who has based his presidential aspirations and has never wavered from his xenophobic positions. I never understood — I just never got it, how you go from Charlottesville and white supremacists to reaching an agreement with him.”
AD

Gutierrez renewed calls for Democrats to withhold support for an upcoming bill that would raise the debt limit or extend government spending, saying that “if you want a budget with Democratic votes, then it's got to have some Democratic priorities.”
Trump aides said the administration's priorities are imperative because legalizing the dreamers without fixing other parts of the immigration system would allow the problem to continue. The last major legislative overhaul to the nation's immigration laws came in 1986 and included a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, but more than 11 million undocumented immigrants are living in the country now.
The White House's list of immigration principles will move the debate over the fate of the dreamers toward the prospect of broader comprehensive reform. Efforts to forge a comprehensive bill failed under the past two presidents, Barack Obama and George W. Bush.

During his campaign, Trump had threatened to end DACA on his first day in office, but he equivocated for months, suggesting that the decision over the fate of the dreamers was among the most difficult he faced. After Texas and several other states announced plans to sue the administration over the program, Trump moved to end it but said he would hold off the most drastic measures for six months to give Congress time to find a legislative solution.
“We would expect Congress to include all the reforms in any package that addresses the status of the DACA recipients,” said one White House aide on the conference call who was not authorized to speak on the record. “Other views had their fair day in the democratic process.”
Noting that the Republicans swept the White House and both chambers of Congress in November, the aide added: “The American public voted for the reforms included in this package.”"
5686,Trump\xe2\x80\x99s DACA demands met with outrage from \xe2\x80\x98Chuck and Nancy\xe2\x80\x99',Fox News (Online),10/9/2017,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/10/09/trump-s-daca-demands-met-with-outrage-from-chuck-and-nancy.html,"President Trump's political dalliance with ""Chuck and Nancy"" already is running into problems, as the top congressional Democrats balk at the president's new terms for a deal to help the roughly 800,000 young illegal immigrants known as 'Dreamers.'
“This proposal fails to represent any attempt at compromise,” House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement, after the administration announced the demands Sunday night.
The friction comes roughly three weeks after Pelosi and Schumer left a White House dinner with Trump saying they’d agreed to a framework deal to help the young illegal immigrants, as Trump moves to end their protections under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA).
The Trump administration outlined an extensive list of conditions late Sunday.
“The administration can't be serious about compromise,” Pelosi, of California, and Schumer, of New York, also said in their Sunday night statement. “We told the president at our meeting that we were open to reasonable border security measures … but this list goes so far beyond what is reasonable.”
Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, on Monday questioned what Schumer thinks is “reasonable.”
“You have people who are losing loved ones because they are killed by an illegal immigrant,” Conway said on “Fox & Friends.” “What's reasonable is to stop the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the border. I'd like to know what Chuck Schumer thinks is reasonable.”
Trump in recent weeks has turned to Schumer and Pelosi amid frustration with Senate Republicans, after they repeatedly failed to repeal and replace ObamaCare, denying him a major legislative victory and the ability to fulfill a top campaign promise.
Trump left the earlier meeting touting his efforts with “Chuck and Nancy” but was not specific about whether wall funding was a necessity.
The administration's requirements announced Sunday include additional crackdowns on “sanctuary cities” that protect illegal immigrants; reducing the number of incoming refugees; 10,000 more Customs and Border Patrol agents; and new initiatives curbing the number of unaccompanied immigrants who come to the U.S. illegally as children.
“Over the last several decades, respect for the rule of law has broken down and immigration enforcement has been sacrificed for the sake of political expediency,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said after the announcement. “This plan will work.”
House Speaker Paul Ryan’s spokesman Doug Andres said the GOP-controlled chamber’s immigration working group would review the roughly 70-point White House list, then consult with the entire Republican caucus and the administration.
The White House plan is considered a starting point for congressional negotiations.
While the plan is already being embraced by Capitol Hill’s most conservative members, including a number of immigration hawks, backlash is growing among Democrats.
“It is immoral for the president to use the lives of these young people as bargaining chips in his quest to impose his cruel, anti-immigrant and un-American agenda on our nation,” said New Mexico Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
The House Freedom Caucus, the chamber’s most conservative wing, is backing the plan.
“We applaud the administration's leadership on principles that will be critical to any immigration policy changes,” said caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C. “We look forward to the administration's insistence on these principles in any deal that is signed into law.""
In dismantling DACA, the administration has argued it was forced to act because federal courts were ready to rule the program was unconstitutional, which would have put the Dreamers’ future in jeopardy.
Trump, in announcing the end of DACA, gave Congress six months to find a legislative alternative.
The White House on Sunday night also asked to limit family-based green cards to spouses and the minor children of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, in addition to creating a point-based system.
And it called for boosting fees at border crossings, making it easier to deport gang members and unaccompanied children, and overhauling the asylum system.
Conway also said Monday that the White House requests are the result of collaborations with such agencies as the departments of Justice, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol.

2590,Trump demands border wall funds for Dreamer proposal',The Hill,10/9/2017,,,http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/354481-trump-sends-congress-hardline-immigration-plan,"The White House on Sunday said it would seek more funds from Congress to finance building a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as the resources to hire thousands more immigration officers.
The Trump administration's new ""immigration principles and policies"" call for a crackdown on border security, more resources to catch individuals residing in the country illegally and a merit-based system that limits chain migration to spouses and children.
The new demands would have to be met for President Trump to agree to legislation that would protect from deportation young immigrants who entered the country illegally as children. These recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, often called ""Dreamers,"" have been the focal point of recent talks between Trump and Democratic leaders of Congress.

""These findings outline reforms that must be included as part of any legislation addressing the status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients,"" Trump said in a statement following the announcement of the proposal on Sunday. ""Without these reforms, illegal immigration and chain migration, which severely and unfairly burden American workers and taxpayers, will continue without end.""
Trump announced the winding down of the DACA program last month but has expressed interest in a legislative fix.
The tough demands on enforcement may make it harder for the two sides to reach a deal, however, as Democrats were quick to criticize the White House announcement on Sunday.
The White House said in order to properly protect the nation's borders, Congress must approve of the construction of a border wall to deter human and drug trafficking.
""Success of border walls are undeniable from the perspective of their operators,"" U.S. Customs and Border Protection acting Deputy Commissioner Ronald Vitiello said Sunday.
The plan also takes a hard-line stance against unaccompanied minors who enter the country, advocating for the removal of the legal limitations, or what it calls “loopholes,” currently in place that prevent “unaccompanied alien children” from being deported from the U.S.
""These loopholes in current law create a dramatic pull factor for additional illegal immigration and in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the apprehensions of [unaccompanied alien children] at our southern border. Therefore, the Administration proposes amending current law to ensure the expeditious return of UACs and family units,"" a press release stated.
Trump is also calling on Congress to reduce funding for so-called sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal authorities in enforcing immigration law. The proposal calls on Congress to cut funding from certain grants and agreements to punish the ""states and localities that refuse to cooperate with Federal authorities.""
Additionally, the administration is advocating for a ""refugee ceiling"" that caps how many are let into the country to an unspecified ""appropriate level.""
""The refugee ceiling needs to be realigned with American priorities,"" the press release continued, pointing to the nation's historically high average of resettling refugees compared to ""the rest of the world combined.""
The plan suggests measures that allow for a swift deportation process once Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or other authorities detect and catch those residing in the country illegally.
Administration officials also emphasized the need to change the immigration system from family-based to merit-based, a proposal made by Sens.

That idea was panned by Democrats and many Republicans, because it also mandated a drastic cut in total immigration numbers.
The new demands represent a shift for the administration in that officials previously had signaled a willingness to not demand money for the wall, but money for border security instead. Now the administration is insisting on money for the wall.
Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke said the new principles aim to ""enforce our immigration laws, secure our border, and protect American communities across this country.""
""[Department of Homeland Security] frontline personnel identified many of the principles outlined today, including closing loopholes in our ability to enforce immigration laws and eliminating the magnets for illegal immigration,"" Duke said in a statement Sunday night, adding that she looks ""forward to working with Congress"" on the legislation and possible reforms.

""This plan will work. If followed it will produce an immigration system with integrity and one in which we can take pride. Perhaps the best result will be that unlawful attempts to enter will continue their dramatic decline,"" Sessions said in a statement.

Motel 6 added that the company is issuing a directive to all of its locations that sending ICE daily lists of guests staying at Motel 6s is ""prohibited.""

Robert McWhirter, an attorney for a former guest of the motel, Jose Renteria Alvarado, said the business shared its guest logs with the agents, KPHO reported. Alvarado was arrested in June while staying at the motel and could face deportation.
""I imagine what went on here is they probably took a look at the names on the guest registry and compared that to a database of people that have been deported,"" McWhirter told KPHO.
Alvarado has been deported once previously due to a criminal record, and could now face six months in prison and then be deported.

""The agency receives viable enforcement tips from a host of sources, including other law enforcement agencies, relevant databases, crime victims, and the general public via the agency’s tip line and online tip form…” Kice said.
She added: ""It’s worth noting that hotels and motels, including those in the Phoenix area, have frequently been exploited by criminal organizations engaged in highly dangerous illegal enterprises, including human trafficking and human smuggling.""

Motel 6’s parent company, G6 Hospitality LLC, said locations in the Phoenix-area have been voluntarily handing over guest information to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) employees.
“This was implemented at the local level without the knowledge of senior management,” G6 spokeswoman Raiza Rehkoff wrote in an email. “When we became aware of it last week, it was discontinued.” ​She said the company is investigating the incidents. The Blackstone Group acquired Motel 6 in 2012 as part of a $1.9 billion deal. At least 20 undocumented people were arrested at two Motel 6 locations between February and August, according to the Phoenix New Times.
Clerks at “multiple” Motel 6 properties around Phoenix said they regularly share customer information with federal immigration authorities, the New Times reported. “We send a report every morning to ICE—all the names of everybody that comes in,” a front-desk clerk told the newspaper. “Every morning at about 5 o’clock, we do the audit, and we push a button, and it sends it to ICE.” Rehkoff didn’t respond to a question about whether other Motel 6 properties had operated similarly with ICE or other law enforcement agencies.
In a second statement issued later Thursday, Motel 6 said it plans to direct all of its more than 1,400 locations nationwide not to voluntarily provide daily guest lists to ICE. “Motel 6 apologizes for this incident and will continue to work to earn the trust and patronage of our millions of loyal guests,” the company said.
“Most people probably don’t realize they’re talking about the light of a police siren”
The role of Motel 6 outposts in aiding U.S. immigration enforcement raises the question of whether ICE agents are soliciting guest data from other lodging chains. An ICE spokeswoman, Virginia Kice, declined to discuss how the agency collects enforcement leads, but in an email Wednesday, she wrote “it’s worth noting” that hotels and motels have been frequently used “in highly dangerous enterprises, including human trafficking and human smuggling.”
Innkeepers routinely comply with search warrants and other court orders when law enforcement agents seek customer data and may reveal customer information when police are summoned to a property for an emergency or other public-safety situation. But the largest U.S. hotel trade group says most lodging companies prohibit the voluntary offer of such data. Rosanna Maietta, a spokeswoman for the American Hotel & Lodging Association, said guest and employee privacy is a “high priority” for the industry.
“We understand that the standard practice is that guest information of any type is not turned over to anybody asking for it absent a subpoena or other compulsory process, except under extenuating circumstances such as when the safety of other guests comes into question,” she said.
Legally, there could be constitutional violations if ICE agents enlisted the help of Motel 6 operators, effectively making them agents of the government. Additionally, state privacy laws could mean civil or criminal penalties for motels who disclose customer information. A spokesperson for a New York-based group called the Center for Popular Democracy said a boycott of Motel 6 and protests would begin tomorrow in Arizona and Texas.
Another large chain, Choice Hotels International Inc., which franchises several brands, including Comfort Inn, Rodeway Inn, and Sleep Inn, will give guest information to law enforcement only “pursuant to a valid subpoena,” according to a spokeswoman. Each of the company’s hotels, however, is independently owned and operated.
Motel 6 traces its history to 1960, when two California real estate contractors saw a need for low-cost lodging. Its signature tag line, “We’ll leave the light on for you” began with a 1986 radio advertising campaign.
Two years ago, the American Civil Liberties Union criticized G6 Hospitality’s practices after a Motel 6 property in Warwick, R.I., acknowledged sharing its daily guest list with local police. Over a year, Warwick police arrested 75 people at the motel, which sits adjacent to the busy I-95, a local ABC television station reported in March 2015.
“When Motel 6 says in its ads that they’ll ‘leave the light on for you,’ most people probably don’t realize they’re talking about the light of a police siren,” the ACLU’s Rhode Island chapter said.
The incidents in Arizona come as suburban Dallas-based G6 Hospitality is expanding into the Latin American market with a brand called Estudio 6. The first two of an envisioned 55 properties are scheduled to open this year in Salamanca and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.
Brian Frieda, president of the Texas Police Chiefs Association and chief of police in Sweetwater, Texas, said he wasn’t aware of departments that routinely gather such information. He also said he doesn’t allow such police solicitations of motels in his area, a West Texas town of 11,000. “To the best of my knowledge, no hotel/motel in my jurisdiction just makes this data available unless … it is under a court order,” Frieda said.
This spring, the association and chiefs of several major Texas cities expressed strong opposition to a proposed state bill that would have allowed police officers to inquire about a person’s immigration status. The cities said they didn’t want to shoulder a federal immigration enforcement role, which would “further strain the relationship between local law enforcement and these diverse communities.” They also argued the law would make it more difficult to apprehend criminals, since witnesses may be afraid to contact or speak with police because of their immigration status.

6258,Motel 6 Admits Arizona Sites Were Reporting Guests To ICE Without Chain\xe2\x80\x99s Approval',HuffPost,9/14/2017,,,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/motel-6-admits-immigration-reports_us_59b9e79be4b086432b04471f,"Employees at Motel 6 locations in Phoenix have ceased working with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents in light of a new report that revealed motel staffers were reporting guests who appear to be undocumented immigrants, according to a spokeswoman for the motel chain.
Raiza Rehkoff, the director of public relations and marketing for the motel chain’s parent company, G6 Hospitality, told HuffPost that staff members were working with ICE without the approval of senior management, but it ended last week when management found out.
“Regarding recent media story on Phoenix-area location, this was implemented at the local level without the knowledge of senior management,” Rehkoff said in an emailed statement. “When we became aware of it last week, it was discontinued. We are currently investigating and will provide more information shortly.”
Rehkoff did not respond to HuffPost’s questions about whether Motel 6 condemned the employees actions ― i.e., sharing guest information with ICE ― or whether any staff members would face disciplinary actions.
ICE agents have arrested at least 20 people who were staying at two Motel 6 locations in Phoenix, according to an investigative report published Wednesday by the Phoenix New Times. Employees at both motels told the weekly newspaper that they were sharing customers’ personal information with ICE on a regular basis.
“We send a report every morning to ICE — all the names of everybody that comes in,” an unidentified front-desk clerk explained to the New Times. “Every morning at about 5 o’clock, we do the audit and we push a button and it sends it to ICE.”
Staff at the Motel 6 on North Black Canyon Highway declined to answer questions from HuffPost about the New Times report and instead directed HuffPost to call its national media phone number. There was no answer at the Motel 6 on 52nd Drive; instead, HuffPost was automatically routed to a national Motel 6 reservation service.
The New Times report revealed that, of the 20 arrests made at Motel 6 properties in Phoenix, one-third involved agents knocking on a suspect’s motel room door without a search warrant and asking for permission to enter.
Yasmeen Pitts O’Keefe, a spokeswoman for ICE’s Phoenix division, told the New Times that these so-called “knock and talks” were typical, but she would not reveal how the agency received the guest information, saying that they were confidential “investigative techniques.”
Law enforcement officials are barred by a 2015 Supreme Court ruling from forcing hotels to turn in guest information, which may suggest that the Motel 6 employees had volunteered to work with ICE agents.
Empowered by the Trump administration and President Donald Trump’s promise to severely crack down on illegal immigration, ICE agents have ramped up efforts to arrest undocumented immigrants. In June, ICE Director Thomas Homan had warned that all undocumented immigrants “need to be worried” and said that ICE would also go after non-criminal undocumented people. The agency “shouldn’t play favorites,” he told the House Appropriations Committee’s Homeland Security Subcommittee.
And these efforts have seen results: Within Trump’s first 100 days in office, the arrests of suspected illegal immigrants rose nearly 40 percent.
Phoenix attorney Robert McWhirter, whose client was arrested at a Motel 6 in June, told the New Times that reports of ICE agents knocking door-to-door for people who appeared to be Latino would raise concerns of racial profiling.
“We just don’t know enough about what’s going on,” he told the newspaper, adding, “I’ll tell you one goddamned thing for sure — I’m not staying at a Motel 6 from now on.”
McWhirter isn’t alone. Since news broke of Motel 6 employees ratting out undocumented immigrants, many have vowed to boycott the chain.

US President Donald Trump has said he is ""fairly close"" to a bipartisan deal to protect young undocumented migrants known as Dreamers.
Mr Trump told journalists at the White House that any agreement must include ""massive border security"".
The president said funding for his proposed border wall on the US border with Mexico was not part of the pact.
Mr Trump spoke a day after talks with top Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer at the White House.
The president's right-wing supporters are infuriated.
Only last week Mr Trump stunned fellow Republicans by making a budget deal with the Democrats.

The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme allows some 800,000 people to remain in the US, and provides temporary permits for work and study.
The Obama-era scheme was put in place to protect so-called ""Dreamers"" - migrants who entered the US illegally as children - from deportation.
What next for 'Dreamers'?
Flip flops mock Trump contradictory tweets
Only last week Mr Trump announced he would cancel the programme.
He said he was giving Congress six months to enact a replacement plan for Daca recipients.
Deal or No Deal - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Washington
Welcome to another episode of Deal or No Deal, White House edition. Unlike the classic game show, however, Donald Trump appears to be playing against himself.
In a series of tweets, the president denied he had struck an immigration/border security agreement with Democratic congressional leaders, then effectively endorsed the same terms they set out in a press release Wednesday night.
When speaking to reporters, he even echoed Democratic justifications for why undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children should be given normalised residency status.
This comes as a shock to some of Trump's diehard anti-immigration supporters, who view any Daca-like agreement as amnesty for law-breakers. Congressional Republicans, who were working on their own deal with Democrats, are in a daze as well.
There is the possibility that this could be a Nixon-in-China moment for the president, where only a man who campaigned vociferously against undocumented immigrants could agree to give legal residency to hundreds of thousands of them.
Unlike Nixon's China diplomacy, however, Mr Trump will need congressional Republicans to go along with his deal. Many voted against his earlier agreement to raise the debt limit and avoid a government shutdown.
This could be an even heavier lift.
Decoding Trump's Daca dalliances
Heading to Florida on Thursday morning to view the damage from Hurricane Irma, Mr Trump told journalists: ""We're working on a plan subject to getting massive border control, we are working on a plan for Daca. People want to see that happen.""
He added: ""So we met last night with, as you know, with Schumer, Pelosi and a whole group and I think we're fairly close but we have to get massive border security.""
The president said the congressional Republican leadership was ""on board"" with the plan.

""The wall is going to be built,"" he added. ""It will be funded a little bit later.""
Democrats have repeatedly vowed to block any legislation that includes funding for the border wall - a key campaign pledge by Mr Trump.
After arriving in Florida, Mr Trump denied that he would back a path to citizenship for Dreamers.
""We're not looking at amnesty,"" he said.
During the presidential campaign, in August 2015, Mr Trump said in a TV interview that Dreamers ""have to go"".
But on Thursday, he voiced support for the young immigrants in language that echoed former President Barack Obama.
""Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military? Really!"" Mr Trump tweeted.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The US president said he had ""great love"" for Daca Dreamers
Paul Ryan, the top Republican in Congress, said Mr Trump's meeting with Democrats ""was a discussion not an agreement or a negotiation"".
Ms Pelosi told reporters no deal had been finalised with the president.
But she added: ""We had an agreement to move forward in our view, with a Dream Act as the basis for how we protect the Dreamers, and for further discussions on what provisions relating to the border might be and an accompanying bill or whatever as we go forward.""
Democrats failed to get Daca on to the statute books during the Obama administration, so it would be a political coup to succeed in doing so when Republicans control the White House and Congress.
Mr Trump's ultraconservative supporters are now upset.
Congressman Steve King of Iowa tweeted at the president that, if the latest reports are true, ""Trump base is blown up, destroyed, irreparable, and disillusioned beyond repair. No promise is credible.""
One of Mr Trump's earliest backers, media commentator Ann Coulter, tweeted: ""At this point, who DOESN'T want Trump impeached?""
Breitbart, the website run by Mr Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon, ran the headline, ""Amnesty Don"" and accused the president of ""a full-fledged cave"".
Fox News host Sean Hannity tweeted that ""weak Republicans have betrayed voters"" and pushed Mr Trump ""into arms of political suicide"".
What is Daca?
The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme was created in 2012 by then-President Barack Obama to shield children of undocumented immigrants from deportation.
It also provided work and study permits for those it covered - popularly known as ""Dreamers"".
In order to qualify for Daca, applicants under the age of 30 were required to submit personal information to the Department of Homeland Security, including addresses and phone numbers.
They had to pass an FBI background check, have a clean criminal background, and either be in school, recently graduated or have been honourably discharged from the military.
In exchange, the US government agreed to ""defer"" any action on their immigration status for a period of two years.
The majority of Dreamers are from Mexico and other Latin American countries.
The Department of Justice has said no new Daca applications will be taken."
2756,"Trump: 'No deal' yet with Pelosi and Schumer on DACA, wall will be built""",Fox News (Online),9/14/2017,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/14/white-house-disputes-schumer-pelosis-border-wall-claim.html,"President Trump on Thursday denied reports that he struck a ""deal"" overnight with top Democrats to protect so-called “Dreamers,” while insisting “massive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent.”
Trump’s Twitter post was in response to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announcing after a dinner meeting at the White House that they had ""agreed to a plan to work out an agreement to protect our nation’s DREAMers from deportation.""
They also said ""we would review border security measures that didn’t include building a wall.""
The president clarified Thursday morning that he intends for the wall to be built -- and while he wants to helps Dreamers, there's no deal yet.
""No deal was made last night on DACA. Massive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent. Would be subject to vote,"" Trump tweeted. ""The WALL, which is already under construction in the form of new renovation of old and existing fences and walls, will continue to be built.""
Trump, on the ground in Florida to survey hurricane damage, later told reporters they were “fairly close” on a deal but insisted a border wall “is vital.” He said they must have an understanding in some legislation to fund the wall, “otherwise we’re not doing anything.”
Pelosi and Schumer called Wednesday night's dinner at the White House “very productive.""
Shortly after their statement, the White House issued its own statement agreeing that the sit-down was productive, but the exclusion of the border wall ""was certainly not agreed to.""
Trump, before and after the dinner meeting, has voiced concern about the fate of the young illegal immigrants who had been protected under the Obama-era DACA program that he aims to reverse. The program shielded illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children from deportation. While Trump is rolling back the executive action that allowed it, he is giving Congress time to pass a legislative alternative -- a point he underscored Thursday.
""Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military? Really! ... They have been in our country for many years through no fault of their own - brought in by parents at young age. Plus BIG border security,"" he tweeted.
Pelosi and Schumer, though, tried to dial down tensions by mid-morning, releasing a joint statement suggesting they’re actually all on the same page.
“President Trump’s Tweets are not inconsistent with the agreement reached last night,” they said. “As we said last night, there was no final deal, but there was agreement on” working to protect Dreamers with legislation.
They said they agreed the wall would not be part of this agreement, though Trump wants to pursue it later, and both sides agreed to “work out a border security package.”
Tensions between the White House and top Democrats remain on the issue, despite the dinner meeting.
Pelosi's Twitter account still has a pinned tweet that reads: ""Trump’s cowardice is on full display today. His cruelty must not stand! #ProtectDREAMERS.""
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said earlier Wednesday that Trump was “committed to the wall. It doesn’t have to be tied to DACA, but it's important and he will get it done.”
Matt House, Schumer’s communications director, responded on Twitter: “The President made clear he would continue pushing the wall, just not as part of this agreement.”
The New York Times cited a White House official who said Trump pushed for border wall funding at the meeting.
Beside the border wall issue, the Democrats said Trump agreed to enshrine protections for the nearly 800,000 immigrants brought illegally to this country as kids who had benefited from the DACA program.
House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also sat down with Pelosi to talk immigration Wednesday, said in an interview that deporting the so-called Dreamers was “not in our nation’s interest,” and said the president had “made the right call.”
“I wanted him to give us time. I didn’t want this to be rescinded on Day One and create chaos,” Ryan said, arguing the time would allow Congress to “come up with the right kind of consensus and compromise to fix this problem.”
The dinner took place in the White House’s Blue Room, sources told Fox News. The Congress members sat at a rectangular table with Trump at the head with Pelosi to his right, and Schumer to his left. Eleven people were in the room, sources said. The first half-hour addressed trade issues with China.
The meeting between the three came shortly after Trump overruled congressional Republicans and cut a deal with Democrats to raise the federal debt ceiling for three months. Some conservatives criticized the deal as a capitulation by Trump.
Trump, however, appears to see bipartisanship as a key to get legislation out of the starting gate.
“More and more we’re trying to work things out together,” Trump explained Wednesday, calling the development a “positive thing” for both parties.
“Some of the greatest legislation ever passed, it was done on a bipartisan manner. And so that is why we’re going to give it a shot,” Trump said.

One day after Mr. Trump hosted Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi for dinner at the White House, the president said he could support legislation to protect the young immigrants known as “Dreamers” from deportation if it were accompanied by a “massive” border security upgrade. Acceding to a key Democratic demand, Mr. Trump said such a package did not need to have funding for a border wall.
It was the second time this month that a tentative agreement announced by Democrats left Republican leaders in Congress scrambling to adjust a legislative agenda that appears increasingly set by the party out of power in the House, the Senate and the White House.
“We’re working on a plan for DACA,” Mr. Trump told reporters, referring to protections for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, as he prepared to leave the White House for Florida. He added, “The wall will come later.”"
3606,"The clock is ticking': Graham and Durbin urge action on bipartisan DREAM Act by the end of September""",Business Insider,9/6/2017,,,http://www.businessinsider.com/daca-lindsey-graham-dick-durbin-urge-action-on-dream-act-trump-immigration-news-2017-9,"Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., left, with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Sept. 5, 2017 Associated Press/Manuel Balce Ceneta Two senators on Tuesday urged Congress to move quickly on bipartisan legislation that would provide legal status to the hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants who have lived in the United States since they were children, and now face losing protection from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program.
The latest call for action on the DREAM Act, issued by Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, came just hours after the Trump administration said it would phase out DACA over the next six months.
""Today this announcement that was handed down, first by Attorney General Sessions and then by the president, tells us that the clock is ticking,"" Durbin told media.
""We are now in a countdown toward deportation for 780,000 protected by DACA today. For those young men and women across America, I can tell you this is a moment of great concern, great fear, and great anxiety about what's going to happen to their lives.""
The most recent version of the DREAM Act, introduced in July, would offer legal permanent residence — and eventually a pathway to citizenship — to young immigrants if they arrived in the US as children, obtained a high school degree or GED, and are enrolled in higher education, employed, or serve in the military.
Immigrants would also have to undergo background checks, demonstrate English-language proficiency, and have a criminal record clear of felonies or other ""serious crimes.""
Durbin has introduced the DREAM Act in various iterations throughout the last 16 years and received minor victories, although none of the bills managed to pass both the House and Senate at the same time. Durbin and Graham both expressed hope that the latest version of the legislation would be passed by the end of September.
""I am committed to fixing this problem once and for all,"" Graham said at the news conference. ""This is a defining moment … we are the party of a constitutional process. We believe in doing it right. But 'right' means taking care of these kids.""
Graham praised Trump's decision to rescind DACA and pass the issue over to Congress, but noted that some of his Republican colleagues will likely be reluctant to offer young undocumented immigrants legal status, lest the move encourage more illegal immigration.
""I think most Republicans believe you have to have a secure border or you'll have 11 million more [undocumented immigrants] in the future,"" he said, adding that his solution is to work on subsequent legislation that would address border security, after the DREAM Act is passed.
Passing DREAM in the near future will be difficult. Congress is gearing up for a busy month packed with must-pass legislation, including bills to raise the debt ceiling, fund the government, overhaul the tax code, and stabilize the individual health-insurance exchanges."

In the statement, Gardner added that he had ""long called for"" comprehensive immigration reform, saying finding a legislative fix to the DACA scheme signified ""an important step.""

The bill was called the Dream Act, and in Congresses Democratic and Republican, and in the Bush and Obama administrations, whether by stand-alone bill or comprehensive immigration legislation, it failed again and again.
Now, with 800,000 lives in the balance and a fiercely anti-immigration current running through the Republican Party, lawmakers are being asked to try again — with a six-month deadline, to boot. The prospects for success after more than a decade of false starts would already be daunting, but President Trump may have made the odds even longer after he promised voters last year that Republicans would take a hard line on immigration, then punted the issue to Congress.
His invitation to lawmakers on Tuesday to “do something and do it right” for the so-called dreamers will run into the headwinds of his own politics. On the other hand, lawmakers who for 16 years have been unwilling to grant legal status to a sympathetic group of unauthorized immigrants may find that taking their legal status away is even harder than conferring it.
“I’m hoping that this is a moment where we are forced to finally do something,” said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and an original author of the Dream Act — the letters stand for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors. “We want to call this bill for a vote on the floor of the House and the floor of the Senate. I am hoping that we will have enough votes to pass it.”"
3244,Obama Speaks Out On Trump Ending Dreamer Protections',HuffPost,9/5/2017,,,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-trump-daca_us_59a40c37e4b06d67e338f449,"WASHINGTON ― Former President Barack Obama said Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s decision to dismantle the program protecting young undocumented immigrants was “contrary to our spirit, and to common sense.”
Trump announced Tuesday that he will end Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, in six months. Unless Congress steps in, ending the program could put nearly 800,000 undocumented young people at risk of deportation and unable to work legally when their two-year permits expire.
Obama said it was a “political decision, and a moral question” ― and one of basic decency.
“To target these young people is wrong ― because they have done nothing wrong,” he said in a statement. “It is self-defeating ― because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love. And it is cruel. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we’d want our own kids to be treated. It’s about who we are as a people ― and who we want to be.”
Obama started the program in 2012 and urged undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to come forward to the government, pay a fee and undergo a background check before receiving a two-year work permit and reprieve from deportation.
He did so after legislative efforts to help Dreamers ― which are being revived now because of Trump’s decisions ― failed multiple times, as he noted in his statement.
″[B]ecause it made no sense to expel talented, driven, patriotic young people from the only country they know solely because of the actions of their parents, my administration acted to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people, so that they could continue to contribute to our communities and our country,” Obama said.
To target hopeful young strivers who grew up here is wrong, because they’ve done nothing wrong. My statement: https://t.co/TCxZdld7L4 — Barack Obama (@BarackObama) September 5, 2017
Trump promised during his presidential campaign to immediately end DACA, but Obama urged him not to, both publicly and in private conversations. In his final press conference as president, Obama said he would speak out if Trump targeted Dreamers “who have grown up here and for all practical purposes are American kids and send them someplace else when they love this country; they are our kids’ friends and their classmates, and are now entering into community colleges or, in some cases, serving in our military.”
“The notion that we would just arbitrarily, or because of politics, punish those kids when they didn’t do anything wrong themselves I think would be something that would merit me speaking out,” Obama said at the time.
By ending DACA, Trump dismantled one of Obama’s most significant immigration policy achievements. Trump already dramatically reshaped immigration enforcement from how it was under Obama, who began his presidency with record deportation numbers before changing enforcement priorities to focus on certain undocumented immigrants over others.
Trump immediately eliminated those priorities as president and has detained and deported people whom Obama allowed to remain in the country if they checked in with the government or met other requirements.
Trump said that Congress should act on Dreamers, although his statements were vague and the only legislation he mentioned specifically during his statement on DACA focused on limiting legal immigration, not actually undocumented immigrants.
Obama said it was time for Congress to act as well.
“Now that the White House has shifted its responsibility for these young people to Congress, it’s up to Members of Congress to protect these young people and our future,” Obama said. “I’m heartened by those who’ve suggested that they should. And I join my voice with the majority of Americans who hope they step up and do it with a sense of moral urgency that matches the urgency these young people feel.”
Former Vice President Joe Biden, who served with Obama, similarly condemned Trump’s decision to end DACA.
″[L]et’s be clear: throwing [Dreamers] out is cruel,” Biden said in a statement. “It is inhumane. And it is not America. Congress and the American people now have an obligation to step up and show our neighbors that they’re welcome here, in the only place they’ve ever called home.”"

The former president said he had asked Congress to send him an immigration bill. When that bill never came, the Obama administration decided to act by creating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
""We did so based on the well-established legal principle of prosecutorial discretion, deployed by Democratic and Republican presidents alike, because our immigration enforcement agencies have limited resources, and it makes sense to focus those resources on those who come illegally to this country to do us harm,"" he said.
As young people stepped forward and deportations of criminals went up, ""America grew stronger as a result,"" he wrote.
Now that the issue has been punted back to Congress, Obama called on its members to ""protect these young people and our future.""
""Ultimately, this is about basic decency,"" he said. ""This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we'd want our own kids to be treated. It's about who we are as a people — and who we want to be.""

“To target these young people is wrong – because they have done nothing wrong.

“What if our kid’s science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer? Where are we supposed to send her? To a country she doesn’t know or remember, with a language she may not even speak?”
“Let’s be clear: the action taken today isn’t required legally. It’s a political decision, and a moral question. Whatever concerns or complaints Americans may have about immigration in general, we shouldn’t threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own, who pose no threat, who are not taking away anything from the rest of us,” Obama claimed.
“They are that pitcher on our kid’s softball team, that first responder who helps out his community after a disaster, that cadet in ROTC who wants nothing more than to wear the uniform of the country that gave him a chance. Kicking them out won’t lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone’s taxes, or raise anybody’s wages.”

They called on lawmakers to determine the ultimate fate of DACA recipients, known as “dreamers,” and emphasized that no work permits would be revoked for at least six months to give Congress time to act.

In a sign of the political sensitivities involved, Trump did not make public remarks, deferring to Attorney General Jeff Sessions to unveil the decision at the Justice Department.
In a written statement, Trump asserted that Obama made “an end-run around Congress” that violated “the core tenets that sustain our Republic.” He added that there can be “no path to principled immigration reform if the executive branch is able to rewrite or nullify federal laws at will.”
A wide array of politicians, civic leaders and business executives spoke out against Trump’s move, including the Mexican government, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and the Catholic Charities of New York. Some Democrats, including New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman, vowed to pursue legal action to protect the dreamers.

In a lengthy post on his Facebook page, Obama called Trump’s move “cruel” and said it represented a “political decision” to a “moral question.”
""Ultimately,"" Obama wrote, “this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we’d want our own kids to be treated. It’s about who we are as a people — and who we want to be.”
Senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security said the agency would no longer accept new applications for DACA other than those submitted before Tuesday. Immigrants enrolled in the program will be permitted to continue until their two-year work permits expire. And those whose permits expire through March 5, 2018, are allowed to seek renewals provided they do so by Oct. 5, officials said.

If Congress fails to act, dreamers would not be high priorities for deportation, the DHS officials said, but they would be issued notices to appear at immigration court if they are encountered by federal immigration officers. There are no plans for DHS to use personal information, including home addresses, of dreamers who registered for work permits to aid in deportation operations unless there is an immediate concern over national security, officials said.
“Our enforcement priorities remain unchanged,” Trump said in his statement. “We are focused on criminals, security threats, recent border-crossers, visa overstays, and repeat violators. I have advised the Department of Homeland Security that DACA recipients are not enforcement priorities unless they are criminals, are involved in criminal activity, or are members of a gang.”
Congressional leaders from both parties said the time was right to pursue a legislative solution to the dreamers, but they did not lay out a clear path on an issue that has vexed lawmakers since President Ronald Reagan signed the last major comprehensive immigration bill in 1986. The Dream Act, which would have offered a path to citizenship to dreamers, failed narrowly in the Senate in 2010 after passing in the House.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who last week had urged Trump not to end the program until Congress acted, called DACA a “clear abuse of executive authority” by Obama.
“It is my hope that the House and Senate, with the president’s leadership, will be able to find consensus on a permanent legislative solution that includes ensuring that those who have done nothing wrong can still contribute as a valued part of this great country,” Ryan said.
Trump had equivocated for months as pressure mounted among immigration hawks to fulfill a campaign promise to end DACA. Reflecting his personal ambivalence, he had vowed to show “great heart” in his decision and declared that dreamers could “rest easy.”
AD
But a threat from Texas and several other states to sue the administration if it did not end DACA by Tuesday forced Trump to make a decision. Several senior aides, including Sessions, who declared the Justice Department would be unable to defend the program in court, lobbied the president to end DACA. Others, including Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, the former DHS secretary, cautioned that terminating the program would cause chaos for young immigrants who enjoy broad popular support.
AD
The Obama administration had defended the creation of the 2012 program by citing the precedent of “prosecutorial discretion” in which law enforcement agencies with limited resources set priorities to fulfill their obligations. With more than 11 million immigrants in the country illegally, the government had the ability to deport only a small fraction each year, Obama aides said at the time.

Sessions wrote a memo Monday concluding that DACA is unconstitutional, prompting acting Homeland Security secretary Elaine Duke to issue orders Tuesday to phase out the program, officials said. In his remarks, Sessions said Obama “sought to achieve specifically what the legislative branch refused to do” and added that “the Department of Justice cannot defend this overreach.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton applauded Trump’s decision, saying DACA “went far beyond the executive branch’s legitimate authority.” Paxton said that as a result of Trump’s decision, the states would lift their threat of legal action.

DACA supporters expressed skepticism that an administration that has taken a hard line on immigration would exercise restraint with dreamers once the work permits begin to expire.
More than 300 immigration activists protested front of the White House, calling Trump a “liar” and a “monster,” and more than two dozen demonstrators were reportedly arrested outside Trump Tower in New York. Javier Palomarez, president of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, resigned from Trump’s presidential diversity committee over the “disgraceful action.”
In a tweet, former vice president Joe Biden wrote: “Brought by parents, these children had no choice in coming here. Now they’ll be sent to countries they’ve never known. Cruel. Not America.”
AD
And in a sign that both sides could seek to use the dreamers to rally their political bases, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sent out a fundraising pitch to Democratic supporters, calling the decision “quite possibly the cruelest thing President Trump has ever done.”
AD
That prompted White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to counter that Pelosi’s fundraising was the “most heartless” act of the day.
The fight over the dreamers now shifts to Congress, where several new proposals have been put forward. Those include the Bridge Act, a bipartisan bill with 25 co-sponsors that would extend DACA protections for three years to give Congress time to enact permanent legislation.
AD
But the White House and conservative Republicans are likely to demand additional provisions to boost border security, such as funding for Trump’s proposed border wall or new measures to restrict legal immigration. In his statement, Trump expressed support for the Raise Act, a proposal from conservative Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) to slash legal immigration levels by half over a decade.

“We will resolve the DACA issue with heart and compassion — but through the lawful Democratic process,” Trump said, “while at the same time ensuring that any immigration reform we adopt provides enduring benefits for the American citizens we were elected to serve.”"

""I do not favor punishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents,"" Trump said Tuesday in a written statement. Still, he added, ""we must also recognize that we are nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws.""
Trump insisted Congress should be responsible for immigration policy. ""The legislative branch, not the executive branch, writes these laws,"" he said.
Speaking later with reporters, Trump said he has ""a great heart"" for those involved in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and said ""hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly.""
More:DACA fix could 'overwhelm' Congress that has failed to devise an immigration solution
The Department of Homeland Security will immediately stop accepting applications to the DACA program – but current recipients would not be affected until March 5 of next year. This gives Congress time to find a legislative solution to replace the program, which currently shields some 800,000 young immigrants from deportation.
Yet many lawmakers are already questioning whether Congress, already bogged down on health care and tax reform among other issues, will be able to pass a hot-button immigration bill before March. And either way, the courts are also expected to be involved in resolving the dispute over DACA.
Announcing that the U.S. would rescind the 2012 order that created the DACA program, Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the protections provided by former President Barack Obama an ""unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch.""
Providing ""amnesty"" for young undocumented immigrants, Sessions said, meant ""aliens"" took jobs from Americans. It also contributed to a surge of unaccompanied minors on the southern border that yielded terrible humanitarian consequences, he added.
""To have a lawful system of immigration that serves the national interest, we cannot admit everyone who would like to come here,"" Sessions said. ""It's just that simple.""
Obama, in a Facebook posting criticizing Trump's decision, described the policy's reversal as wrong, self-defeating, and ""cruel.""
""Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we’d want our own kids to be treated.""
Obama also noted that Congress couldn't agree on an immigration plan during his presidency, so he acted ""because it made no sense to expel talented, driven, patriotic young people from the only country they know solely because of the actions of their parents.""

Obama on Trump's DACA decision: 'To target these young people is wrong'
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Tuesday the announcement came today due to deadlines from a group of Republican attorneys general from 10 states, who threatened to file a lawsuit against the DACA program if Trump didn't end it.
Rather than risk a judicial decision suddenly ending DACA, Sanders said, Trump authorized an ""orderly wind down"" and placed the responsibility for immigration back where it belongs: Congress.
“We have confidence that Congress is going to step up and do its job,"" she said.
Yet attorneys for undocumented immigrants involved in the program have also threatened lawsuits if DACA ends – and the state attorneys general of New York and Washington have vowed to challenge the administration's action in court.
""DREAMers are Americans in every way,"" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Tuesday, adding that more than 40,000 New Yorkers are shielded under current DACA protections. ""They played by the rules; they pay their taxes; and they've earned the right to stay in the only home they have ever known.""
Schneiderman, Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson and other attorneys general were expected to join forces to mount a legal challenge.
“We have been working closely with legal teams around the country, and we expect to be joined by other states in this action,"" Ferguson said in a statement Monday night. “I will use all the legal tools at my disposal to defend the thousands of DREAMers in Washington state.""
The American Civil Liberties Union, which has also pledged to defend DACA in court, accused Trump of ""manufacturing a crisis.""
""Today is a cruel day for dreamers, our families and all Americans,"" said Lorella Praeli, the ACLU's director of immigration policy and campaigns.
""There is no humane way to end DACA before having a permanent legislative fix in place. President Trump just threw the lives and futures of 800,000 dreamers and their families, including my own, into fearful disarray.""

Hispanic Chamber CEO resigns from Trump's diversity council over DACA decision
According to a statement from the department of Homeland Security, immigrants with DACA permits that expire before March 5 can apply for a two-year renewal, but must do so before Oct. 5.
The Department of Homeland Security reports that 201,678 enrollees are set to see their protections expire in calendar year 2017; another 275,344 are set for expiration during the entire year of 2018.
Their fates remain uncertain.
Even if Congress does not take action by next March, officials said there is no guarantee that DACA members will be deported – the priority will continue to be on undocumented migrants who have committed crimes.
In his statement, Trump said, ""I have advised the Department of Homeland Security that DACA recipients are not enforcement priorities unless they are criminals, are involved in criminal activity, or are members of a gang.""
Trump's announcement quickly drew scorn from Democratic lawmakers and even some Republicans who accused Trump of seeking to get rid of hundreds of thousands of immigrants who contribute to the U.S. economy, and were brought into the country as children.
Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., called Trump's decision ""a heartless and grave mistake. We should never be a country that kicks out some of our best and brightest students.""
And Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain called rescinding DACA ""the wrong approach to immigration policy at a time when both sides of the aisle need to come together to reform our broken immigration system."" McCain added that children ""who were illegally brought into this country through no fault of their own should not be forced to return to a country they do not know.""
While some Republicans had cautioned against tasking Congress with a major immigration push considering its already crowded legislative agenda, congressional leaders said they would take action.
House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., who described DACA as well-intentioned but an abuse of executive authority, said Congress needs to address ""a permanent legislative solution that includes ensuring that those who have done nothing wrong can still contribute as a valued part of this great country.”
American business leaders also objected to Trump's immigration moves.
Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, tweeted that ""250 of my Apple coworkers are #Dreamers. I stand with them. They deserve our respect as equals and a solution rooted in American values.""
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also objected, saying that cutting off hundreds of thousands of young people from employment eligibility ""runs contrary to the president’s goal of growing the U.S. economy.""
Yet organizations that say loose immigration policies have undercut the wages of working Americans applauded Trump's move.
Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, an organization that seeks to reduce immigration to the U.S., said Congress needs ""to focus on strong immigration enforcement measures and reforms to our legal immigration system that put American workers first."""
4740,"Trump administration ends DACA, with 6-month delay'",Fox News (Online),9/5/2017,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/09/05/trump-administration-ends-daca-with-6-month-delay.html,"The Trump administration on Tuesday announced the “orderly wind down” of the Obama-era program that gave a deportation reprieve to illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children – putting pressure on Congress to come up with a replacement.
“I do not favor punishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents. But we must also recognize that we are a nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws,” President Trump said, in a lengthy written statement explaining the decision.
The Department of Homeland Security formally rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, with a six-month delay for current recipients. According to Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke, the interval is meant to give Congress “time to deliver on appropriate legislative solutions.”
“However, I want to be clear that no new initial requests or associated applications filed after today will be acted on,” Duke said in a written statement.
READ TRUMP'S DACA STATEMENT
The decision touched off a firestorm on Capitol Hill, where Democrats blasted the president and Republicans blamed the prior administration for putting Trump in a legal bind.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, speaking to reporters, decried what he called the Obama administration's ""disrespect for the legislative process"" in enacting the 2012 policy. He said the “unilateral executive amnesty” probably would have been blocked by the courts anyway.
“The executive branch, through DACA, deliberately sought to achieve what the legislative branch specifically refused to authorize on multiple occasions,” Sessions said, blaming the policy for the recent “surge” at the border. “Such an open-ended circumvention of immigration laws was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch.”
The Trump administration was facing a Tuesday deadline to make a decision on DACA or face legal action by Republican state AGs who hoped to force the president’s hand in discontinuing the program. A day earlier, Sessions sent Duke a letter with his legal determination that the 2012 executive action was unconstitutional.
Administration officials cast their approach Tuesday at the least disruptive option.
In his statement, Trump stressed that while new applications for work permits won’t be accepted, “all existing work permits will be honored until their date of expiration up to two full years from today.”
Trump also said applications in the pipeline will be processed.
“This is a gradual process, not a sudden phaseout,” he said. “Permits will not begin to expire for another six months, and will remain active for up to 24 months. Thus, in effect, I am not going to just cut DACA off, but rather provide a window of opportunity for Congress to finally act.”
Trump vowed to resolve the issue “with heart and compassion,” only this time working through Congress.
During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump had promised to terminate DACA, though he appeared to soften his stance since taking office. In ending the program with a six-month delay, Trump put the onus on Congress to pass a legislative fix.
According to DHS, no current beneficiaries will be impacted before March 5, 2018.
“Congress, get ready to do your job - DACA!” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.
While some Republicans support the goals of the DACA program, many opposed the use of executive action to institute it, describing the move as a presidential overreach.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is among those who now support the call to protect so-called “Dreamers” with legislation.
“I have always believed DACA was a presidential overreach,” he said in a statement. ""However, I equally understand the plight of the Dream Act kids who -- for all practical purposes -- know no country other than America.”
On a conference call, administration officials said Tuesday they are still prioritizing criminal aliens for deportation. But they described the original DACA criteria as very broad and cited the legal determination of the Justice Department.
During the presidential campaign, Trump referred to DACA as “illegal amnesty.” However, he seemed to edge away from that stance in April when he told the Associated Press that DACA recipients could “rest easy.”
WHAT IS DACA AND WHY WOULD TRUMP DISMANTLE IT?
The DACA program was formed through executive action by former President Barack Obama in 2012, allowing recipients to get a deportation reprieve – and work permits – for a two-year period subject to renewal. Under the program, individuals were able to request DACA status if they were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012, came to the U.S. before turning 16 and have continuously lived in the country since June 15, 2007. Individuals must also have a high school diploma, GED certification, been honorably discharged from the military or still be in school. Recipients cannot have a criminal record.
Congress had been considering legislation to shield young illegal immigrants from deportation for years, dating back to the George W. Bush administration. Lawmakers tried again to pass a bill during the Obama administration, but couldn’t muster the votes amid flagging Republican support before Obama formed the program in 2012.
Nearly 800,000 undocumented youth are currently under the program's umbrella.
HILL REPUBLICANS REVIVE ‘DREAM ACT’ TALKS AS TRUMP DECIDES FATE OF OBAMA PROGRAM
On Friday, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said he supported a legislative solution to protect undocumented minors, but also urged the president to reconsider scrapping DACA.
Following Tuesday's announcement, however, Ryan called DACA a “clear abuse of executive authority” and urged Congress to act.
“Congress writes laws, not the president, and ending this program fulfills a promise that President Trump made to restore the proper role of the executive and legislative branches. But now there is more to do, and the president has called on Congress to act,” he said in a statement. “At the heart of this issue are young people who came to this country through no fault of their own, and for many of them it’s the only country they know.”
But opposition to the DACA termination is already fierce.
Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement that, with the decision, ""Donald Trump has secured his legacy as a champion for cruelty.""
""President Trump’s decision to end DACA is a deeply shameful act of political cowardice and a despicable assault on innocent young people in communities across America,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement
Even as they blasted the president, Democrats called for legislative action, leaving open the possibility that the two parties could pass a bill in the coming months.

Politico and Reuters, citing unnamed sources, reported that Trump had decided to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, known as DACA, which Trump inherited from President Barack Obama.
Reuters, citing sources familiar with the situation, said Trump will give Congress six months to craft a bill to replace DACA. But a senior White House aide told Politico that John Kelly, Trump's chief of staff, “thinks Congress should’ve gotten its act together a lot longer ago.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions helped persuade the president to terminate the program, Politico reported, but White House aides cautioned that “nothing is set in stone” until an official announcement has been made. The White House could still change its mind.
The White House informed House Speaker Paul Ryan of the president’s decision on Sunday morning, Politico reported, citing a source close to the administration.
It's not clear from the reports how the six-month delay would work or whether or not Congress will act in that time period.
Ending DACA would fulfill a campaign promise that is sure to please Trump's supporters but terrify DREAMers — immigrants illegally brought to the United States as children — whose lives will be upended.
Reaction Sunday night was swift: Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., tweeted: ""If Trump decides to end DACA, it will be one of the ugliest and cruelest decisions ever made by a president in our modern history.""
More:Democrats take to Twitter to react to reports of Trump ending DACA
Sanders added that if Trump ends DACA, Congress must act immediately to restore it. ""Taking legal protections away from 800,000 young people raised in this country is absolutely counter to what we stand for as a nation,"" he said.
U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said: ""For all the members of Congress over the past 5 years who said DACA should've been done 'legislatively' here's your chance. #DefendDACA.""
Although Trump has taken a clear stand against illegal immigration throughout the campaign and his presidency, he had wavered on the future of DACA. During the campaign, he vowed to end it. After winning the November election, he said he would treat DREAMers with ""great heart"" and said they ""shouldn't be very worried.""
DACA was created in 2012 by the Obama administration after several failed attempts in Congress to pass a law to protect these undocumented immigrants. While announcing the program during a speech in the Rose Garden, Obama said those DREAMers didn't make the decision to enter the U.S. illegally and shouldn't be punished as a result.
""They are Americans in their heart, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper,"" Obama said. ""It is the right thing to do.""
The program he established grants two-year stays for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States before their 16th birthday who have attended school or joined the military and have not committed any serious crimes. It also grants them work permits. Enrollees can renew their status after each two-year period, and some are currently on their third term.
More:1,850 U.S. leaders to Trump: Don't kill DREAMer protection program
More:What is DACA?
The program was created through a memorandum from the Department of Homeland Security, which means it could be rescinded at any time without any input from Congress. That was always a concern of applicants, who knew their protections could be taken away by a future president and the personal information they provided could be used to arrest and deport them.
Obama later tried to expand the number of undocumented immigrants he could protect from deportation. In 2014, he proposed a new program that would extend similar protections to undocumented immigrants whose children were born in the U.S. and thus are citizens.
That's when Republicans decided to fight back. Republican leaders from 25 states sued in court to block the deportation program for adults, convincing a federal judge in Texas to halt the program two days before it was to go into effect. The Department of Justice appealed that ruling up to the Supreme Court, but a 4-4 split left the lower court's ruling intact, effectively killing the program for adults.
With Trump in office, those Republican leaders assumed Trump would move quickly to end DACA. As the months dragged on, they grew impatient. Republican leaders from 10 states, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, sent a warning to Trump: end DACA or we'll sue. They gave Trump a deadline of Sept. 5.
Kelly, the president's chief of staff and his former secretary of Homeland Security, told members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in July that DACA would probably not survive that kind of lawsuit. He hinted that the program's days could be numbered.
A variety of groups have pleaded with the Trump administration in recent weeks to maintain the program. On Aug. 14, more than 100 law professors signed a letter to Trump insisting that DACA is perfectly legal. On Wednesday, a group of more than 1,850 governors, state attorneys general, faith leaders, police chiefs, sheriffs and civic leaders signed a statement urging Trump to keep the program.
""As the leaders of communities across the country—individuals and institutions that have seen these young people grow up in our communities—we recognize how they have enriched and strengthened our cities, states, schools, businesses, congregations, and families,"" the statement read. ""We believe it is a moral imperative that the administration and the country know we are with them."""

It’s been debated. And now the Trump White House supposedly has a final decision: The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that originated under the Obama administration is over. There will be a six-month enforcement delay, however. Eliana Johnson of Politico has more [Emphasis mine]:
President Donald Trump has decided to end the Obama-era program that grants work permits to undocumented immigrants who arrived in the country as children, according to two sources familiar with his thinking. Senior White House aides huddled Sunday afternoon to discuss the rollout of a decision likely to ignite a political firestorm — and fulfill one of the president’s core campaign promises. Trump has wrestled for months with whether to do away with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA. He has faced strong warnings from members of his own party not to scrap the program and struggled with his own misgivings about targeting minors for deportation. Conversations with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who argued that Congress — rather than the executive branch — is responsible for writing immigration law, helped persuade the president to terminate the program, the two sources said, though White House aides caution that — as with everything in the Trump White House — nothing is set in stone until an official announcement has been made. In a nod to reservations held by many lawmakers, the White House plans to delay the enforcement of the president’s decision for six months, giving Congress a window to act, according to one White House official. But a senior White House aide said that chief of staff John Kelly, who has been running the West Wing policy process on the issue, “thinks Congress should’ve gotten its act together a lot longer ago.”
Katie reported on Friday that a decision was imminent, though the White House said an official announcement is slated for Tuesday. Under DACA, there are around 800,000 illegal aliens benefitting from the program and they’ve been preparing “for the worst” (via USA Today):
We're taking it day by day, because one day it's one thing and another day it's another, but we must be prepared for the worst,"" said Luz Gallegos, community programs director at TODEC Legal Center. ""We're making sure the community has all their family plans in place, making sure kids are aware, you know, if something were to happen to parents, what next steps to take."" […] Gary Finn, an Indio immigration attorney, said the effects of a DACA repeal would not be immediate. Some people would lose their jobs when their work permits expired, if not sooner. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could begin removal proceedings for DACA recipients, but that process takes years ""People may go into a panic, I'm kind of afraid of that, but it's not like ICE will be knocking on the doors the next day,"" Finn said.
Last week, Axios’ Jonathan Swan reported that one of the reasons why DACA was n the chopping block was that the Trump administration’s lawyers felt that they could not defend its legality. Moreover, Swan added that even the Department of Homeland Security noted that if Congress wanted to keep DACA as it is today, it would require an act of Congress. The constitutionality of this Obama-era executive action has been in legal limbo for years. In short, the program allows illegal aliens who entered the U.S. as minors to be shielded from deportation, with the possibility of a work permit, if they meet certain criteria. The application fee is $495. Donald Trump ran on a hardline immigration enforcement platform. It’s looking like this will be another promise kept by Trump."
5579,"Trump to end Daca 'Dreamers' program with six-month delay \xe2\x80\x93 reports""",The Guardian,9/4/2017,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/04/trump-to-end-dreamers-program-with-six-month-delay-reports,"Donald Trump has decided to scrap a program giving work permits to people who came to the United States illegally as children but will give Congress up to six months to find a legislative alternative, according to reports.
The US president decided to delay enforcement of his decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program in order to give Congress time to devise legislation to replace it, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Sunday.
The Obama administration policy protects nearly 800,000 young men and women often called “Dreamers” from deportation and allows them to work legally.
The decision to give Congress half a year to come up with an alternative represents a compromise after Republicans and business leaders asked Trump to keep the program. They included Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Apple chief executive, Tim Cook, who tweeted that 250 staff were “Dreamers” and “I stand with them”.
250 of my Apple coworkers are #Dreamers. I stand with them. They deserve our respect as equals and a solution rooted in American values. — Tim Cook (@tim_cook) September 3, 2017
“Dreamers” are a fraction of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, most of them Hispanic. Trump as a candidate promised to deport all of them, but many Americans have rallied to support the young adults who have spent large parts of their lives in the United States.
The decision, to be announced on Tuesday, will seek to placate both sides in the immigration debate at a time when the president is also grappling with North Korea’s nuclear program and Houston’s recovery from Hurricane Harvey.
House of Representatives speaker Paul Ryan urged Trump on Friday not to rescind the program and was joined by senator Orrin Hatch, also a Republican.
Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban-American Republican from Florida, tweeted her dismay with the decision to scrap Daca: “After teasing #Dreamers for months with talk of his ‘great heart,’ @POTUS slams door on them. Some ‘heart’.”
After teasing #Dreamers for months with talk of his ""great heart,"" @POTUS slams door on them. Some ""heart""... — Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (@RosLehtinen) September 4, 2017
Trump’s base may also be disgruntled about the president’s decision to leave open the option of a fix. Representative Steve King, a hawk on immigration and Iowa Republican, tweeted his opposition to the plan on Sunday night.
Democrats, such as Minnesota senator Al Franken, also wanted the program to continue. Franken called the reported decision a “disgrace”. Nancy Pelosi, the top House Democrat, last week asked Ryan to meet her party to discuss a “comprehensive legislative solution”.

Daca supporters argue that the people it protects are US-educated and integrated into American society, with little connection to the countries in which they are citizens. Opponents of the program argue that illegal immigrants take jobs from US citizens."
6041,Justice Department appeals latest travel ban setback to Supreme Court',Politico,7/15/2017,,,http://www.politico.com/story/2017/07/14/hawaii-judge-allows-grandparents-travel-ban-240543,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the Justice Department intends to return to the Supreme Court to overturn the district court's interpretation. | Getty Justice Department appeals latest travel ban setback to Supreme Court
The Justice Department on Friday appealed to the Supreme Court a federal judge's decision to allow grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles and other relatives of people in the U.S. to circumvent the Trump administration's travel ban policy.
The order, issued Thursday evening local time in Honolulu by Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii, deals a temporary blow to one of the president’s signature initiatives. It also prohibits the administration from blocking refugees with a commitment from a resettlement agency in the U.S., a move that could revive the flow of refugee admissions this year.

In its appeal to the High Court, the Justice Department argues that Watson's interpretation ""empties the Court's decision of meaning,"" because it includes ""not just 'close' family members, but virtually all family members.""
""Treating all of these relationships as 'close familial relationship[s]' reads the term 'close' out of the Court’s decision.""
Earlier Friday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions promised that the administration would ""directly"" appeal Watson's ruling.
The Supreme Court on Saturday morning filed a motion calling for the Hawaii court to respond to the Trump administration's request by noon on Tuesday.

The decision was a victory for opponents of the travel ban, who hoped to broaden the universe of people who could bypass the president’s policy, which temporarily bars travelers from six majority-Muslim nations and suspends the refugee resettlement program.
The ruling prompted a rebuke from Sessions, who released a statement Friday afternoon accusing the district court of issuing ""decisions that are entrusted to the Executive Branch, undermined national security, delayed necessary action, created confusion, and violated a proper respect for separation of powers.""
""By this decision, the district court has improperly substituted its policy preferences for the national security judgments of the Executive branch in a time of grave threats, defying both the lawful prerogatives of the Executive Branch and the directive of the Supreme Court,"" Sessions said.
Sessions said the Justice Department intends to return to the Supreme Court to overturn the district court's interpretation.
The Supreme Court issued an order on June 26 that allowed the embattled measure to go into effect, but included the caveat that affected travelers with “bona fide” ties to a person or entity in the U.S. should not be subject to the ban.
While the high court offered some guidance, it didn’t specifically list the categories of people or entities who might qualify as “bona fide.” When the Trump administration implemented the policy with a narrow definition that excluded grandparents and grandchildren, among others, advocates moved to take legal action.
In the realm of refugee resettlement, the administration stood by the contention that a connection to a resettlement agency alone would not meet the criteria to avoid the ban.
Judge Watson disagreed with those interpretations, however, and said the government’s guidance contradicted the Supreme Court’s order.
“Common sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents,” he wrote. “Indeed, grandparents are the epitome of close family members. The Government’s definition excludes them. That simply cannot be.”
The federal judge added that a refugee with a commitment from a resettlement agency met the standard for a “bona fide” relationship spelled out in the Supreme Court order.
“It is formal, it is a documented contract, it is binding, it triggers responsibilities and obligations, including compensation, it is issued specific to an individual refugee only when that refugee has been approved for entry by the Department of Homeland Security, and it is issued in the ordinary course, and historically has been for decades,” he wrote.
“Bona fide does not get any more bona fide than that.”
On Twitter, an attorney for the plaintiffs, the state of Hawaii and a local imam, celebrated the momentary legal win, which could be met with appeals by the federal government.
“Sweeping victory in #hawaiivstrump just now,” wrote Neal Katyal, going on to quote the order. “Court: ‘The government's definition represents the antithesis of common sense.’”
A State Department spokesperson said Friday morning that officials ""were reviewing the decision and will be in consultation with [the Justice Department] to ensure immediate implementation.""

3351,Trump administration appeals Hawaii court ruling on travel ban',Fox News (Online),7/15/2017,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/07/15/trump-administration-appeals-hawaii-court-ruling-on-travel-ban.html,"The Trump administration has told the Supreme Court that a lower court ruling earlier this week altering an executive order on immigration would bring thousands more refugees into the county and requires the justices’ “immediate intervention,” according to filing documents obtained early Saturday by Fox News.
The high court on Saturday gave the opposing parties in the case -- state of Hawaii et al -- until noon Tuesday to file responses to the Justice Department request.
In a victory for the administration, the Supreme Court late last month lifted key components of an injunction against President Trump's temporary travel ban on refugees and visitors from six mostly-Muslim countries.
The court reinstated much of the administration’s policy and promised to hear full arguments as early as this fall.
The high court’s ruling also exempted many refugees and travelers with a ""bona fide relationship"" with a person or an entity in the U.S.
The justices did not define those relationships but said they could include a close relative, a job offer or admission to a college or university.
The Trump administration defined the relationships as people who had a parent, spouse, fiancé, son, daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling already in the U.S.
However, U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson, in Hawaii, issued an order Thursday to expand the list of U.S. family relationships that refugees and visitors from the six countries can use to get into the United States to include grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins.
“The government therefore is left to seek this court’s immediate intervention,” Justice Department attorneys said in the 68-page filing submitted Friday.
The high court’s nine justices are on a three-month summer recess. But they are prepared to handle the emergency application and could issue an order on enforcement in coming days.
Beyond Watson’s order that would expand the scope of “bona fide” family relationship in the United States to allow refugees entrance, the Justice Department also raised a second argument about the relationship between the federal government, potential refugees and a resettlement agency involved in the process.
However, who is allowed into the United States is the focal point of the case, as Trump tries to limit in the influx of visitors as a means of national security, particularly keeping out terrorists.
Any immediate expansion of the refugee program will be on hold until the high court weighs in.
In the Justice Department appeal, agency lawyers argued that Watson's interpretation of the high court ruling on what family relationships qualify the refugees and visitors from the six countries to enter the U.S. ""empties the court's decision of meaning, as it encompasses not just 'close' family members, but virtually all family members. Treating all of these relationships as 'close familial relationship(s)' reads the term 'close' out of the Court's decision.""
Watson's ruling was the latest twist in a long, tangled legal fight that will culminate with arguments before the nation's high court.
It could help more than 24,000 refugees who had already been vetted and approved by the United States but would have been barred by the 120-day freeze on refugee admissions, said Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, a resettlement agency.
""Many of them had already sold all of their belongings to start their new lives in safety,"" she said. ""This decision gives back hope to so many who would otherwise be stranded indefinitely.""
Citing a need to review its vetting process to ensure national security, the Trump administration capped refugee admissions at 50,000 for the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, a ceiling it hit this week.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the administration will ask the Supreme Court to weigh in, bypassing the San Francisco-based 9th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals, which has ruled against it in the case.
The administration took a first step by filing a notice of appeal to the 9th Circuit, allowing it to use a rule to petition the high court directly.
The administration has lost most legal challenges on the travel ban, which applies to citizens of Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Iran and Yemen.
Hawaii Attorney General Douglas S. Chin, who sought the broader definition, said Thursday's ruling ""makes clear that the U.S. government may not ignore the scope of the partial travel ban as it sees fit.""

4401,Trump administration says it will go to Supreme Court after Hawaii judge expands travel ban exemptions',Los Angeles Times,7/15/2017,,,http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-hawaii-judge-travel-ban-07132017-story.html,"The Trump administration said Friday it would go to the Supreme Court to fight a Hawaii federal judge’s decision vastly expanding the number of people exempt from the government’s ban on travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries and all refugees.
U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson ruled Thursday that the government had failed to follow Supreme Court orders last month that established conditions for a partial revival of the ban, whose implementation had been blocked by the courts.
The decision does not halt the travel ban, which was reinstated by the Supreme Court on June 29 with exemptions for a limited list people with “bona fide” U.S. connections, such as close family members. But going against Trump administration policy, the ruling expands the exceptions to include travelers who have grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins and brothers- and sisters-in-law in the U.S.
The judge also said that contrary to government policy, refugees cannot be blocked if they have “formal assurance” from U.S. resettlement agencies for relocation to the country — even if the refugees do not have relatives in the U.S.

The administration’s implementation of the ban’s limits represented “the antithesis of common sense,” the judge said.
In a statement Friday, Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions accused Watson of trying to “micromanage” the president’s authority over ensuring national security.
“By this decision, the district court has improperly substituted its policy preferences for the national security judgments of the executive branch in a time of grave threats, defying both the lawful prerogatives of the executive branch and the directive of the Supreme Court,” Sessions said.
In the meantime, unless a higher court intervenes, Watson’s decision means that potentially thousands of refugees who had been vetted for U.S. admission but were blocked after the government cut off most refugee admissions on Wednesday — the day the country hit a cap of 50,000 refugee admissions for the fiscal year — may now be let in.

“We are reviewing the decision and will be in consultation with DOJ to ensure immediate implementation,” the Department of State said in a statement Friday.
The Department of Justice also said in a court filing Friday that it was challenging Watson’s order in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Refugee resettlement groups and immigrant advocates on Friday celebrated Watson’s decision.
The order “represents relief for over 24,000 refugees who had already been vetted and approved by the U.S. and assigned to resettlement agencies. Many of them had already sold all of their belongings to start their new lives in safety,” Becca Heller, director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, said in a statement. The group is among those suing the administration over the ban.

“This decision gives back hope to so many who would otherwise be stranded indefinitely,” Heller said. “Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for our refugee clients, who are still affected by the government’s attempts to freeze refugee resettlement.”
For two weeks, the Trump administration and the state of Hawaii have fought repeatedly in federal courts over whom the ban can block.
At issue is how to determine which travelers have “close” relatives living in the U.S. or are associated with the country in other ways that let them bypass the ban — standards set by the Supreme Court when it lifted the previous halt on enforcement of the ban.
President Trump’s executive order halts travel by nationals of Somalia, Syria, Sudan, Yemen, Libya and Iran but allows exceptions for those with what the Supreme Court called “bona fide” connections with the U.S. The government has said those connections include a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, sibling, fiance or fiancee, and in-law parents.

But the administration said grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins and brothers- and sisters-in-law are not close enough to qualify for admission during the duration of the order. Attorneys for the state of Hawaii successfully petitioned Watson to order the government to count all of those categories as “bona fide” U.S. connections.
In the case of refugees, state lawyers argued that a refugee resettlement organization’s interactions with a refugee constitute a bona fide relationship. The administration disagreed.
Hawaii’s win came after it was twice rejected in court attempts to weaken the ban.
On July 6, Watson denied a request from the state to “clarify” exceptions to the ban, saying that he did not have the authority to interpret Supreme Court orders. The next day, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a similar request from the state, saying it did not have jurisdiction over the matter.

But appellate judges told challengers that they could try a different legal maneuver in the district court. Judges said Hawaii attorneys could request Watson to issue an injunction against the ban’s implementation or modify an injunction he had issued that previously had halted the ban before his order was partially lifted by the Supreme Court. Hawaii filed both requests last week.
The travel ban calls for a three-month pause on travel to the U.S. by nationals of the six Muslim-majority countries and a four-month halt on all refugee resettlement.
Watson was one of the judges who granted a restraining order blocking implementation. His order was issued in a case filed in March by the state of Hawaii.
Successful challenges in that case and another filed in a Maryland federal court were upheld in the 9th Circuit and 4th Circuit appellate courts before requests were made to the Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of the ban.

On June 26, the Supreme Court said the ban could be put back into place with exceptions, but left it up to the government to define most of them. The court indicated its move was a temporary measure until justices hear full arguments on Trump’s executive order in the fall.

The Supreme Court granted the Trump administration's request earlier this week to reinstate part of the travel ban meant to temporarily block people from six predominately Muslim countries from entering the U.S.
Foreign nationals can enter the country if they have a ""credible claim of bona fide relationship"" in the U.S.

Otherwise, they are temporarily banned for 90 days, or 120 days if they're a refugee coming from any country in the world.
According to The Associated Press, the U.S. will not revoke visas that have already been approved.
People applying to come to the U.S. from the six countries — Syria, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Iran and Yemen — need to show they have a relationship with a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, or sibling in the U.S., the AP reported, citing State Department instructions.
Those trying to come to the U.S. for business or professional reasons need to show a relationship that is ""formal, documented and formed in the ordinary course rather than for the purpose of evading"" the order, the State Department said.
President Trump earlier this week hailed the Supreme Court's decision, calling it a ""clear victory for our national security.""
Trump said in a statement his ""number one responsibility"" is to keep the American people safe, adding that the court's ruling allows him to do just that.
“Today's unanimous Supreme Court decision is a clear victory for our national security,” the president said.
“Today's ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our nation's homeland,” he added. “I am also particularly gratified that the Supreme Court’s decision was 9-0.”
The court on Monday also agreed to hear the government's appeal of lower courts that had prevented the ban from going into place.
The court will hear the case when it returns for the fall term, which begins the first Monday in October. Arguments have not yet been scheduled.

Journalists, students, and workers who can prove they have invitations or employment contracts in the U.S. are exempt. Only those with ""formal, documented"" professional ties will be granted entry.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Visa applicants from six Muslim-majority countries must have a close U.S. family relationship or formal ties to a U.S. entity to be admitted to the United States under guidance distributed by the U.S. State Department on Wednesday.
NEW: Trump administration will put its travel ban on refugees and migrants from 6 countries into effect at 8 p.m. ET tomorrow. — Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) June 29, 2017
The guidance defined a close familial relationship as being a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling, including step siblings and other step family relations, according to a copy of a cable distributed to all U.S. diplomatic posts and seen by Reuters.
The cable, first reported by the Associated Press, said close family “does not include grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-laws and sisters-in-law, fiancés, and any other ‘extended’ family members.”
It also specified that any relationship with a U.S. entity “must be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading the E.O.,” a reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s March 6 executive order barring most U.S. travel by citizens of the six nations for 90 days.
The cable provides advice to U.S. consular officers on how to interpret Monday’s Supreme Court ruling that allowed parts of the executive order, which had been blocked by the courts, to be implemented while the highest U.S. court considers the matter.
The six nations whose citizens are covered by the executive order are Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.
Asked about the guidance issued on Wednesday night, the State Department declined to comment on internal communications.
The cable’s language closely mirrored the Supreme Court’s order on the travel ban, though it appeared to interpret it in a narrow manner, notably in its definition of close family.
It was unclear on Wednesday evening whether the State Department’s interpretation of the court’s order would spark further legal action by opponents of the ban.
The guidance gave several examples of what might constitute a bona fide relationship with a U.S. entity, and said broad categories would be exempt from the travel ban, such as those eligible for student visas, “as their bona fide relationship to a person or entity is inherent in the visa classification.”
Similarly, those eligible for family or employment based immigrant visa applications are exempt from the travel ban, the cable said.
The cable said “a worker who accepted an offer of employment from a company in the United States or a lecturer invited to address an audience in the United States would be exempt” from thetravel ban, but someone who simply made a hotel reservation would not count as someone with a bona fide relationship.
Trump’s executive order also imposed a 120-day ban on entry to the United States by refugees. Monday’s Supreme Court order, however, said the ban did not cover those refugees “who can credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity” in the United States.
The State Department guidance was unclear on what U.S. refugee agencies regard as a key question: whether their own dealings with refugees applying to come to the United States constituted a bona fide relationship.
The cable said that consulates should continue to interview applicants for so-called diversity visas, which are granted to individuals from countries that typically do not send many immigrants to the United States. In 2015, around 10,500 citizens from the six banned countries were selected for the diversity visa lottery, according to State Department figures.
The travel ban will likely bar such visas for citizens of the six countries, the cable acknowledged, stating that “we anticipate that very few DV applicants are likely to be exempt from the E.O.’s suspension of entry or to qualify for a waiver.”

USA TODAY
WASHINGTON — President Trump's Department of Homeland Security has rescinded former President Barack Obama's order shielding millions of migrants from deportation, but is letting stand a policy that grants reprieves to people who arrived in the United States as children.
Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly announced late Thursday that, after consulting with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, he is rescinding an Obama memorandum from 2014 that allowed immigrants to remain in the United States under certain conditions.
The rescinded memo created a program that protected undocumented immigrants from deportation if they have a child who is a U.S. citizen or lawful resident.
The program – known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA – was never implemented because it was challenged in court by 26 states and was put on hold by federal courts.
The DHS decision to rescind the memo came ahead of a court-ordered deadline to resolve the case.
Kelly said in a news release that he decided to rescind the memo because “there is no credible path forward” to litigate the policy.
The decision fulfills part of a campaign promise by Trump, who vowed to overturn two of Obama’s memos on illegal immigration.
However, Kelly said the decision would not impact an Obama program created in 2012 that granted reprieves from deportation to nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children.
The terms of that program, known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, will not change, Kelly said.
The rescinded program provided expanded work authorization for recipients under DACA.
But so-called Dreamers “who were issued three-year extensions before the district court’s injunction will not be affected and will be eligible to seek a two-year extension upon their expiration,"" the news release said. ""No work permits will be terminated prior to their current expiration dates.""

Advocates for undocumented immigrants warned that while Kelly left the DACA program in place for now, there’s nothing to keep the Trump administration from reversing it in the future.
“This memo and the response from the White House is not a permanent promise to protect” the program, said Greisa Martinez Rosas, advocacy director for United We Dream, which identifies itself as the largest immigrant youth-led organization in the nation.
“The DACA program still stands,"" she said, ""but it’s vulnerable.”
Advocacy groups also were incensed that the Trump administration rescinded the parental program on the fifth anniversary of DACA.
Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., praised Kelly's decision to rescind the DAPA program, calling it “a deeply irresponsible policy from the start.”
“It essentially said to illegal immigrants that we wouldn’t enforce our laws and encouraged them to risk their lives in coming to the United States,” Cotton said. “It was also a blatant attempt by the president to circumvent Congress that the courts swiftly shut down. I’m glad to see Secretary Kelly take it off the books. Such a high-handed fiat deserves nothing less than to be rescinded in full.”
Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., blasted Kelly’s decision, noting that it came as Democrats and Republicans had put aside partisanship and gathered for the Congressional Baseball Game following the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., during a practice session early Wednesday.
“Before the game had even finished, the Trump administration shattered this spirit of good feelings by announcing the rescission of the DAPA program,” Beyer said.
Beyer took some confront in noting that the DACA program would remain in place, but said that the need for comprehensive immigration reform giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship “has never been more urgent.”"

But White House officials said on Friday morning that Mr. Trump had not made a decision about the long-term fate of the program and might yet follow through on a campaign pledge to take away work permits from the immigrants or deport them.
The Department of Homeland Security announced that it would continue the Obama-era program intended to protect those immigrants from deportation and provide them with work permits so they can find legal employment.
A fact sheet posted on the department’s website says that immigrants enrolled in the 2012 program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, “will continue to be eligible” to renew every two years, and notes that “no work permits will be terminated prior to their current expiration dates.”"

DAPA was blocked by the courts from implementation, which the Department of Homeland Security cited as a reason for rescinding the program. A DHS press released said Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly signed a memorandum rescinding DAPA on Thursday because “there is no credible path forward to litigate the currently enjoined policy.” (RELATED: Texas AG Says Trump Has Done More To Stop Illegal Immigration Than Anyone In World History)
The program had been challenged by 26 states after Obama issued it in November 2014. The Supreme Court deadlocked when ruling on the constitutionality of the program in June 2016, splitting the vote 4-4 due to the empty seat at the time left by late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
One of Trump’s signature campaign promises was that he would rescind both DAPA and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program if elected president.
The DHS press release added, however, that the June 2012 Obama memorandum creating DACA will remain in effect. That program applies to certain illegal aliens in the U.S. who arrived as children and met specific criteria."
2076,Appeals court refuses to reinstate Trump travel ban',The Hill,6/12/2017,,,http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/337434-appeals-court-refuses-to-reinstate-trump-travel-ban,"The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday ruled against President Trump's so-called travel ban, delivering another blow to the administration as it waits for the Supreme Court to decide whether to intervene.
The California-based court affirmed in large part the Hawaii District Court ruling blocking parts of the order, which temporarily banned nationals from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S., suspended the entry of all refugees and reduced the cap on the admission of refugees from 110,000 to 50,000 for the 2017 fiscal year.
ADVERTISEMENT
In a unanimous ruling Monday, a three-judge panel on the court said Trump's revised order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality.
Though the Immigration and Nationality Act gives the president broad powers to control the entry of foreigners, the judges said the president’s authority is subject to certain statutory and constitutional restraints.
Trump stoked controversy last week by again labeling his order a “travel ban” on Twitter. White House officials had rejected that phrase, saying the administration action is not a ban, but is rather setting up a system of extreme vetting.
The judges on Monday cited Trump's tweets in defending their finding that the order does not provide a reason why permitting entry of nationals from the six designated countries under current protocols would be detrimental to the interests of the United States
“Indeed, the President recently confirmed his assessment that it is the ‘countries’ that are inherently dangerous, rather than the 180 million individual nationals of those countries who are barred from entry under the President’s ‘travel ban,’” they wrote in a footnote, citing Trump’s June 5th tweet.
""That’s right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS countries, not some politically correct term that won’t help us protect our people!” Trump had tweeted.
But the judges said the Hawaii District Court erred by blocking the government’s ability to conduct interagency reviews of its vetting procedures.
In their opinion, Judges Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald Gould and Richard Paez — all Clinton-era appointees — vacated that part of the lower court ruling and ordered the court to issue a new order that blocks the temporary ban but allows the government to proceed with its review.
The court also called the government’s argument that the District Court erred in issuing an injunction that runs against the president himself “well taken.”
“Generally, we lack jurisdiction of a bill to enjoin the President in the performance of his official duties,” the judges said.
They vacated that part of the District Court’s injunction to the extent the order runs against the president, but said it still applies to the remaining defendants and all their respective officers, agents, servants, employees and attorneys, and people in active concert or participation with them.
The decision marks the second time the 9th Circuit has ruled against Trump. In February, the court refused to reinstate Trump’s first travel ban after a federal District Court judge in Washington state blocked it.
Trump revised that order — removing Iraq from the list of banned countries, eliminating the indefinite ban on Syrian refugees and deleting language that gave preference to religious minorities when the refugee program resumed — to address the court’s concerns.
The administration has already asked the Supreme Court to step in.
The Department of Justice filed two emergency applications on June 1 asking the Supreme Court to block the 4th Circuit and Hawaii District Court rulings blocking the ban and to review its case.
The Supreme Court had asked the groups fighting the ban to respond to the department's requests by 3 p.m. on Monday.
The 9th Circuit is now the second federal appeals court to rule against Trump's revised travel ban.
A full panel of 13 judges on the Richmond, Va.-based 4th Circuit Court of Appeals also refused to reinstate it, but focused on the statements Trump made while on the campaign trail and in office in finding the order discriminatory.
The judges said in their 10-3 ruling that the revised order “speaks with vague words of national security, but in context drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination.""

6739,Trump gets another travel ban defeat \xe2\x80\x94 and the clock is ticking',Vox,6/12/2017,,,https://www.vox.com/2017/6/12/15783448/trump-muslim-ban-ninth-circuit,"The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Hawaii judge’s ruling barring Donald Trump’s travel ban — which would prevent all entries from six majority-Muslim countries for 90 days, and nearly all refugee admissions for 120 days — from going into effect on Monday.
The Supreme Court is now the last hope for the controversial executive order that sparked mass protests at airports around the country.
“Immigration, even for the President, is not a one-person show,” the court wrote in a per curiam opinion. “The President’s authority is subject to certain statutory and constitutional restraints. We conclude that the President, in issuing the Executive Order, exceeded the scope of the authority delegated to him by Congress.”
The Ninth Circuit’s ruling says the government should be allowed to resume its review of visa procedures — which is intended to lead to new “extreme vetting” tests for people seeking to enter the US — which the Trump administration had argued it hadn’t been able to do thanks to a lower-court order. But the parts of Trump’s executive order that prevent people from entering the US remain on hold.
The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Maryland also upheld a (narrower) ruling against the ban in May, and the Trump administration’s already appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court — in addition to asking it to stop both the East Coast and West Coast rulings from affecting policy while the Supreme Court considers the case, so that the ban could go into effect over the summer.
Now, though, the Ninth Circuit’s piled on yet another stinging defeat for the Trump administration. If the Supreme Court does what the administration wants and allows the travel ban to go into effect, it’ll be flying in the face of every ruling issued on the executive order so far.
The more the administration loses, the harder Trump makes it for them to win
The Ninth Circuit’s ruling doesn’t change the bottom line: The Supreme Court is the only thing that can save Trump’s travel ban now.
The ruling certainly doesn’t make it any easier for the administration. But the Supreme Court’s more conservative than either the Ninth or Fourth Circuits, there’s definitely a chance that the Supremes will overrule every judge who’s looked at the executive order so far and side with the administration.
But the courts, at this point, are no bigger a problem for the Department of Justice than the president himself. Every ruling against the administration on the travel ban sparks a potential temper tantrum from the president on Twitter; every temper tantrum provides more fodder for the travel ban’s opponents.
The Ninth Circuit offered its own proof of this; in a footnote, it cited Trump’s June 5 tweets criticizing the DOJ for revising the original executive order (issued in January) to make it more “politically correct” — effectively undermining the DOJ’s argument that the March executive order was the result of a thoughtful review of national-security policy.
The 9th Circuit decision on President Trump's revised travel ban cites his June 5 tweet https://t.co/qvc7rw61Gn pic.twitter.com/BAxD9pe6Io — Rebecca Berg (@rebeccagberg) June 12, 2017
In theory (though President Trump appears to see it differently) the purpose of the 90-day country-based ban, and the 120-day refugee ban, was to allow the government time to come up with a list of countries that weren’t providing the US with enough information, and ban entries from those countries indefinitely.
The Hawaii ruling put that whole process on hold. But the Ninth Circuit says the Hawaii decision improperly stopped “inter-agency review” and overturned that part of the Hawaii ruling. (It didn’t officially allow the process to start up again, but that ruling should be forthcoming.)
This doesn’t change anything on the ground. The most controversial parts of the executive order Trump signed on March 6 have been put on hold since March 15, when a Hawaii judge issued an injunction against them. The Ninth Circuit is just upholding that objection.
But it makes the question not just of whether the Supreme Court will take up the travel ban cases, but when, all the more relevant.
The Supreme Court has many ways to kill the ban — and it would have to act soon to save it
If it wants to, the Supreme Court can kill it without even taking up the case. It has the option of simply declining to hear the government’s appeals. For another, the Ninth Circuit has made a different legal argument against the ban than the Fourth Circuit did — so far, courts have ruled that the travel ban is unconstitutional because it discriminates against Muslims, while the Ninth Circuit argues that the ban violates the Immigration and Nationality Act by overstepping the president’s authority to suspend immigration into the US.
The biggest problem the administration is facing, though, might be the calendar.
The text of the executive order said that the ban would be in place for 90 days after the effective date of the order — and that the order would be effective on March 16. It didn’t make any exception for what would happen if courts put the ban on hold.
So theoretically, the 90-day, country-based is expiring on Wednesday, June 14. And theoretically, even if the Supreme Court overturned both the Fourth and Ninth Circuits and sided with the government, it wouldn’t be able to implement it. (It would be able to implement the remainder of the 120-day refugee ban.)
In practice, if the Supreme Court decided to allow the travel ban to go into effect, it might try to interpret the phrase “effective date” to mean whichever day the ban was allowed to start.
But if the Supreme Court grants the administration’s request to hear the case, it won’t do so before its next term in the fall. So unless the Court acquiesces to the administration’s request to allow the ban to go into effect now and ask questions later, the process that the government was supposed to be doing while the ban was in place — which it can now restart under the Ninth Circuit’s decision — will have had more than 90 days to unfold. That raises the question of why the government would still need a ban on the six majority-Muslim countries at all, rather than going forward with its semi-permanent blacklist.
Those aren’t questions the Department of Justice is likely to want to answer. To avoid them, it will need the Supreme Court to step in ASAP and allow the travel ban to happen over the summer — overruling literally every court that’s considered the ban to date."
2484,9th Circuit Upholds Injunction On Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Second Travel Ban',The Daily Caller,6/12/2017,,,http://dailycaller.com/2017/06/12/9th-circuit-upholds-injunction-on-trumps-second-travel-ban/,"The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an injunction barring enforcement of key provisions of President Donald Trump’s second executive order on refugees and migrants Monday, finding the president exceeded his lawful authority in issuing the directive.
The 9th Circuit’s decision comes as the Supreme Court reviews a petition submitted by the Department of Justice to review a separate ruling from the 4th Circuit, which also barred enforcement of the order.
The ruling keeps two provisions of the order from taking effect: the first suspends migration from six countries with high instances of terror, and the second reduces the number of refugees the U.S. will accept from 110,000 to 50,000.
“[I]mmigration, even for the President, is not a one-person show,” the court wrote. “The President’s authority is subject to certain statutory and constitutional restraints. We conclude that the President, in issuing the Executive Order, exceeded the scope of the authority delegated to him by Congress.”
The 9th Circuit’s ruling is largely restricted to a textual analysis of the relevant immigration law, unlike other federal courts who have concentrated their inquiry on constitutional arguments. The court argues that a careful reading of the Immigration and Nationality Act — the law the administration cites to justify the legality of the travel ban — reveals that the administration has not shown that the order is lawful.
The court explains:
Section 1182(f) requires that the President find that the entry of a class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. This section requires that the President’s findings support the conclusion that entry of all nationals from the six designated countries, all refugees, and refugees in excess of 50,000 would be harmful to the national interest. There is no sufficient finding in EO2 that the entry of the excluded classes would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.
The court discusses at some length the various ways in which the administration failed to show that migrant and refugee entry would be detrimental to the national interest; among other claims, the court says the order does not show that nationality alone makes one at heightened security risk, or that current vetting procedures are inadequate for national security.
The court also points out that the order is, in some ways, under inclusive, as it would not hinder a terrorist who was radicalized in one of the six countries named in the order, but was born some place else, from entering the United States.
Though the ruling comes as the Supreme Court is grappling with the travel ban litigation arising from the 4th Circuit, it is still a major development. The 4th Circuit’s ruling found that Trump’s order creates the perception that the administration’s purpose is to pursue a policy that disparages Muslims, a violation of the Constitution’s ban on establishing religion.
This ruling put the Supreme Court in a difficult position. The justices will generally avoid weighing in on constitutional questions when it can, — especially where those questions are novel or controversial — and are loath to take up ongoing political controversies. The 9th Circuit’s ruling provides a basis for the high court to leave the travel ban on hold without engaging the contentious constitutional issues the 4th Circuit raises.

6866,"Trump Is Still Pushing His Travel Ban, Potentially Harming His Legal Case'",HuffPost,6/5/2017,,,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-travel-ban-lawsuit_us_5935413ce4b075bff0f4ef18,"President Donald Trump on Monday reiterated his push for his executive order banning travel and immigration from six majority-Muslim countries, lashing out against his own Justice Department and potentially exacerbating the continued legal battle over the order.
Trump’s statements about the ban have already been used against him in court. A federal court in Virginia pointed to Trump’s anti-Muslim rhetoric when it ruled against the executive order last month. Federal judges in Hawaii and Maryland also cited statements from Trump, his administration officials and allies when they placed a nationwide hold on the ban in March.
Trump administration lawyers last week filed an emergency request with the Supreme Court, asking it to revive the ban after multiple courts determined that it intends to discriminate against Muslims.
Trump politicized a terror attack in London on Saturday evening, using it as evidence to promote and justify his order, even before the full details of the attack became known.
He continued to rail against the courts and his own administration on Monday, tweeting that the Justice Department should craft a “much tougher version” of the ban. After courts struck down the original executive order, Trump administration officials submitted “a watered down version,” but it did not hold up in court either.
People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017
The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017
The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017
In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017
When the executive order was originally introduced in January, Trump administration officials tried to argue that it was not a ban.
“The words being used to describe it derive from what the media is calling this,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said. “I think the president talked about extreme vetting and the need to keep America safe, and he made clear this is not a Muslim ban. And it’s not a travel ban. It’s a vetting system to keep America safe.”
But Trump has repeatedly referred to it as a ban in his tweets, undercutting his administration’s arguments. Spicer falsely claimed last month that the administration had been “consistent” in describing it as a ban.
On Monday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway argued on NBC’s “Today” show that the media should not focus on Trump’s tweets and instead cover his actions, criticizing “this obsession with covering everything he says on Twitter and very little of what he does as president.”
But as the president of the United States, Trump’s tweets are important and can be considered official statements.
White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that she did not believe that Trump’s tweets would hurt his legal case.
“The president is very focused on exactly what that order spells out: protecting national security,” she said.
Sanders accused reporters of quibbling over “semantics” when asked whether the executive order constitutes a ban.
“I don’t think the president cares what you call it,” she said.
Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union, which has sued Trump over the executive order, tweeted that it could include Trump’s tweets in its case against him.
Yes, we may incorporate @realDonaldTrump's tweets about the ban into our Supreme Court argument. — ACLU National (@ACLU) June 5, 2017

6927,"Trump rips DOJ for 'watered down' travel ban, seeks swift court hearing""",Fox News (Online),6/5/2017,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/06/05/trump-rips-doj-for-watered-down-travel-ban-seeks-swift-court-hearing.html,"President Trump called out the Justice Department on Monday morning for pushing a “watered down” version of his controversial travel ban executive order, while also urging the DOJ to seek an expedited hearing in front of the Supreme Court to begin the ban's enforcement.
Trump’s travel ban – placing temporary restrictions on travel from several Muslim-majority countries – has been blocked by the courts since Trump signed the original executive order in January. He signed a revised travel ban in March, and that also was blocked from implementation by judges.
“People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!” Trump wrote in the first of four tweets. “The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C. The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!”
“In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political!”
A Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment on Trump's tweets.
Trump’s tweets come in the wake of Saturday’s deadly London attacks, and an increasing string of Islamist assaults around the globe.
Both versions of the Trump travel ban prompted nationwide protests and fierce Democratic opposition. The ban's themselves were ""watered down"" versions of Trump's campaign proposal of a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States."
6364,"Trump says he's calling it a 'travel ban'""",CNN (Web News),6/5/2017,,,http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/05/politics/trump-travel-ban-courts/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump on Monday emphatically referred to his executive order on immigration as a ""travel ban"" and said his Justice Department should not have submitted a ""watered down, politically correct version"" to the Supreme Court.
Trump's suggestion that changes to the ban -- which, among other things, temporarily restricts travel to the US from several Muslim-majority countries -- were due to political correctness could hamper his administration's legal argument that the executive order did not target Muslims. As a candidate, Trump called for a ""total and complete shutdown"" of Muslim immigration to the United States, and Justice Department lawyers have gone to great lengths to avoid calling it a ""travel ban"" in court, referring to it as a ""temporary pause"" or simply ""the executive order.""
In a string of tweets, Trump reiterated comments he made in light of the London terror attacks that the travel ban was necessary.
""People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN,"" he tweeted at 6:25 a.m. ET.
""The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C."" he added.

He then tweeted: ""The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!"" before adding, ""In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe. The courts are slow and political!""
Last week, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to allow the ban after lower courts rebuked his national security justifications for the ban multiple times.
George Conway, the husband of White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway and who was once a top candidate to be the administration's solicitor general, lamented the President's remarks.
""These tweets may make some ppl feel better, but they certainly won't help OSG get 5 votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters. Sad,"" he tweeted
Sen. Ben Cardin said Trump's latest words attacking his own Justice Department revealed his true desire to use the ban to discriminate on religious grounds.
""It clearly shows his intent,"" the Maryland Democrat told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day"" Monday. ""His lawyers try to justify it by saying it wasn't a travel ban, but it was extreme vetting. The President made that clear. It is a travel ban.""

Legal ramifications
As Justice Department attorneys have worked to convince courts not to look at Trump's statements in weighing the legal justifications of the travel ban, the President is not backing down -- instead, he's commenting more.
While DOJ lawyers argue that the revised ban is a significant change from the original order, Trump is minimizing the differences by calling it a ""politically correct version.""
Challengers could read his statements Monday morning as intent to disfavor Muslims in the ban, a point that has doomed the executive orders in court so far. In court briefs, DOJ lawyers have said the orders are ""religion-neutral"" in operation, drawing ""distinctions among countries based on national-security risks identified by Congress and the Executive Branch, not religion, and applies evenhandedly in the six designated countries.""

It's also notable that the revised travel ban was authored by Trump's administration and signed by the President himself -- his Justice Department's role is defending its legality.
Sebastian Gorka, a White House national security aide, told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day"" Monday in the wake of the President's tweets that the travel ban was essential to protecting the US.
""The fact is, it's been the same since the beginning, from the first executive order to the second executive order. It's one thing, Chris: It's about protecting Americans,"" he said.
Monday afternoon, the American Civil Liberties Union, which is serving as co-counsel representing the plaintiffs in the case before the Supreme Court, confirmed it was considering using Trump's morning tweets in its argument.
""Yes, we may incorporate @realDonaldTrump's tweets about the ban into our Supreme Court argument,"" the ACLU tweeted from its flagship account.
And Neal Katyal, who is representing the state of Hawaii, which successfully sued for a nationwide injunction to the revised executive order, rifled off his own tweet:
""Its kinda odd to have the defendant in HawaiivTrump acting as our co-counsel.We don't need the help but will take it!"" he wrot e.

'Go all the way'
At times, Trump's administration has insisted the executive order is not a ""travel ban."" In late January, White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters Trump had made ""very clear that this is not a Muslim ban, it's not a travel ban. It's a vetting system to keep America safe. That's it, plain and simple.""

Less than a week later , Trump used the term ""travel ban"" on Twitter, and he has referred to it as such on multiple occasions since then.
And Trump has previously complained about the revised order, which removed Iraq from the initial seven countries listed in the first ban.
""The order he blocked was a watered-down version of the first order,"" Trump said at a rally in March after a judge in Hawaii blocked the second version of the ban. ""I think we ought to go back to the first (ban), and go all the way.""
""That's what I wanted to do in the first place,"" he added.
Trump revived his call for the travel ban shortly after news broke of the weekend's terror attacks in London. He was then harshly criticized when he appeared to misconstrue a statement while launching an attack on London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who said there was ""no reason to be alarmed"" by the visible increase in police activity in the wake of the attacks."
6502,President Trump Signs Revamped Executive Order Restricting Immigration From 6 Countries',The Daily Caller,3/6/2017,,,http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/06/trump-signs-revamped-executive-order-restricting-immigration-from-6-countries/,"The White House issued a new executive order on immigration Monday that temporarily bars the citizens of Sudan, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days. It has two major differences from the first version of the executive order: it does not include Iraq and removes the blanket ban on Syrian refugees.
Citizens with visas from the six countries listed in the order will not be affected by it and no visas will be revoked solely because of the order. Nationals who did not have a valid visa by Jan. 27 at 5 p.m. “are not eligible to enter the United States while the temporary suspension remains in effect.”
Iraq was excluded from the new order because the United States received “firm commitments” from the Iraqi government that U.S. will be able to vet and screen Iraq nationals as seen fit, a senior administration official said during a call Monday.
During the first 20 days of the ban, DHS will conduct a review of the security and identity information that each country included in the ban provides to the United States in the visa process. Those countries will then have 50 days to comply with whatever suggestions the U.S. makes to “update or improve the quality of the information they provide.”
The order suspends the refugee admissions program for 120 days while the Department of Homeland Security reviews its screening procedures. Once the program resumes, only 50,000 refugees will be allowed in during the fiscal year 2017 — down from the 110,000 accepted last year by Barack Obama’s administration.
It also removes the language that gave priority to Christian refugees applying from countries that are predominantly Muslim.
A Department of Justice official said they expect the new order to withstand the legal scrutiny that the first one did not because it cites specific examples where citizens from these countries were convicted of terrorism.
The order will take effect on March 16.
Though the press was not allowed in the Oval Office for the signing of the executive order, the White House did confirm to a pool reporter that the order was signed."
6622,"President Donald Trump signs new travel ban, exempts Iraq'",CNN (Web News),3/6/2017,,,http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/06/politics/trump-travel-ban-iraq/,"Washington (CNN) US President Donald Trump signed a new executive order Monday that bans immigration from six Muslim-majority countries, dropping Iraq from January's previous order, and reinstates a temporary blanket ban on all refugees.
The new travel ban comes six weeks after Trump's original executive order caused chaos at airports nationwide before it was blocked by federal courts. It removes out language in the original order that indefinitely banned Syrian refugees and called for prioritizing the admission of refugees who are religious minorities in their home countries. That provision drew criticism of a religious test for entry and would have prioritized Christians over Muslims fleeing war-torn countries in the Middle East.
The new ban, which takes effect March 16, also explicitly exempts citizens of the six banned countries who are legal US permanent residents or have valid visas to enter the US -- including those whose visas were revoked during the original implementation of the ban, senior administration officials said.
""We cannot compromise our nation's security by allowing visitors entry when their own governments are unable or unwilling to provide the information we need to vet them responsibly, or when those governments actively support terrorism,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Monday.
The new measures will block citizens of Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from obtaining visas for at least 90 days. The order also suspends admission of refugees into the US for 120 days, directing US officials to improve vetting measures for a program that is already widely regarded as extremely stringent.
Trump signed the executive order earlier Monday in the Oval Office outside the view of reporters and news cameras, after more than three weeks of repeated delays, the latest of which came after White House officials decided last week to delay the signing to avoid cutting into positive coverage of Trump's joint address to Congress.
The delays also came amid an intense lobbying effort from Iraqi government officials, including from the country's prime minister, to remove Iraq from the original seven-state list of banned countries.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Iraq's removal from the list came after an intense review from the State Department to improve vetting of Iraqi citizens in collaboration with the Iraqi government, though he did not specify how vetting had been improved.
""The United States welcomes this kind of close cooperation,"" he said. ""This revised order will bolster the security of the United States and our allies.""
The rollout of the revised travel ban marks an important moment for the administration, which has little room for error after the chaotic debut of the original plan. That failure raised questions about the new White House's capacity to govern and to master the political intricacies needed to manage complicated political endeavors in Washington. It also brought Trump into conflict with the judiciary in the first sign of how constitutional checks and balances could challenge his vision of a powerful presidency built on expansive executive authority.
The original order came under intense criticism as an attempt to bar Muslims from entering the country, and Trump's call during the campaign for a ""Muslim Ban"" was cited in court cases attacking the ban.
The new order does not prioritize religious minorities when considering refugee admissions cases.
Administration officials Monday stressed they do not see the ban as targeting a specific religion.
""(The order is) not any way targeted as a Muslim ban ... we want to make sure everyone understands that,"" an official told reporters.
""The Department of Justice believes that this executive order just as the first executive order is a lawful and proper exercise of presidential authority,"" Sessions said.
Democrats responded by calling Trump's order a repeat version of the first attempt.
""Here we go again...Muslim Ban 2.0 #NoBanNoWall"" tweeted Rep. Andre Carson of Indiana, one of two Muslims serving in the House of Representatives.
Working to contain fallout
The newly crafted order also revealed that the administration wasn't just paying attention to the legal criticism in the courts, but also recalibrating in light of the heavy political fire they faced after the first order's messy rollout.
While administration lawyers argued the original travel ban went into effect immediately to prevent terrorists from rushing into the country, the revised ban will phase in after 10 days. The previous order will be rescinded on that date.
Trump had previously said he opposed giving any advance notice of the ban.
""If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the ""bad"" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad ""dudes"" out there!"" he tweeted on January 30
The White House also abandoned the sense of urgency with which it implemented the first travel ban, delaying the signing of a new executive order multiple times over the last three weeks. Politics also came into play as White House officials delayed the signing from last Wednesday in part to allow positive coverage of the President's joint address to Congress to continue uninterrupted.
""We want the (executive order) to have its own 'moment,'"" a senior administration official told CNN last week.
The President signed the action Monday morning without the fanfare he has given to other executive orders. No media was present during the signing at the White House, an administration official confirmed. White House spokesman Sean Spicer tweeted a picture of Trump signing the order.
White House officials collaborated for several weeks with officials at the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and kept congressional leaders apprised of their progress this time around after the White House drew a backlash for keeping Congress and relevant federal agencies almost entirely in the dark during the first rollout.
To bolster its national security claims, the new executive order also states FBI has reported that approximately 300 people who entered the United States as refugees are ""currently the subjects of counter-terrorism investigations.""
""The fact remains that we are not immune to terrorist threats and that our enemies often use our own freedoms and generosity against us,"" Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said. ""We cannot risk the prospect of malevolent actors using our immigration system to take American lives.""
Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence committee, said the ban ""has the same fundamental flaws"" as the first order.
""We know that country of origin is a poor predictor of a propensity to commit acts of terror. If it were, Pakistan has been a far more problematic source of attack planning and would be at the top of the President's list, but that country merits not even a mention in the order,"" Schiff said in a statement.
Why Iraq was removed
But the new order was also delayed in part because of a debate within the administration over how to handle Iraq.
Tillerson, Secretary of Defense James Mattis and national security adviser Gen. H.R. McMaster had all advocated for Iraq to be removed from the Trump administration's list of banned countries in the new executive order for diplomatic reasons, including Iraq's role in fighting ISIS, sources told CNN's Elise Labott and Evan Perez. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly also supported the move.
Iraq was removed from the revised travel ban executive order after intensive lobbying from the Iraqi government at the highest levels, according to a senior US official.
That included a phone call between Trump and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on February 10 and an in-person conversation between Abadi and Vice President Mike Pence in Munich on February 18.
Those conversations were followed by discussions between Tillerson and members of the Iraqi government about vetting measures in place that would prevent suspected terrorists from leaving Iraq and coming to the United States. Iraq did not implement new measures; rather, the country provided more detail to US officials about how it screens travelers.
In Trump's call with Abadi, the President vowed to seek a resolution to his counterpart's concerns about his citizens' being unable to enter the United States, according to a readout of the phone call from Baghdad. The US official said Trump asked Tillerson to get greater clarity on vetting measures in Iraq.
Trump also faced pressure to remove Iraq from the order from some American national security officials, who argued the restriction burdened a key anti-ISIS partner. Some of those voices were holdovers from the Obama administration.
Iraq's Foreign Ministry welcomed reports of its removal from the list of countries affected by the travel ban.
""(The) Iraqi Foreign Ministry expresses deep relief regarding the executive order that was issued by the American president Donald Trump, which excludes the Iraqis from the travel ban to the United States,"" said Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Ahmad Jamal.

3605,"Hundreds of Immigrants Arrested in 'Routine' US Enforcement Surge""",Newsmax - News,2/11/2017,,,http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/immigrants-arrested-routine-us/2017/02/10/id/773101/,"U.S. federal immigration agents arrested hundreds of undocumented immigrants in at least four states this week in what officials on Friday called routine enforcement actions.
Reports of immigration sweeps this week sparked concern among immigration advocates and families, coming on the heels of President Donald Trump's executive order barring refugees and immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations. That order is currently on hold.
""The fear coursing through immigrant homes and the native-born Americans who love immigrants as friends and family is palpable,"" Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, said in a statement. ""Reports of raids in immigrant communities are a grave concern.""
The enforcement actions took place in Atlanta, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and surrounding areas, said David Marin, director of enforcement and removal for the Los Angeles field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Only five of 161 people arrested in Southern California would not have been enforcement priorities under the Obama administration, he said.
The agency did not release a total number of detainees. The Atlanta office, which covers three states, arrested 200 people, Bryan Cox, a spokesman for the office, said. The 161 arrests in the Los Angeles area were made in a region that included seven highly populated counties, Marin said.
Marin called the five-day operation an ""enforcement surge.""
In a conference call with reporters, he said that such actions were routine, pointing to one last summer in Los Angeles under former President Barack Obama.
""The rash of these recent reports about ICE checkpoints and random sweeps, that's all false and that's dangerous and irresponsible,"" Marin said. ""Reports like that create a panic.""
He said that of the people arrested in Southern California, only 10 did not have criminal records. Of those, five had prior deportation orders.
Michael Kagan, a professor of immigration law at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, said immigration advocates are concerned that the arrests could signal the beginning of more aggressive enforcement and increased deportations under Trump.
""It sounds as if the majority are people who would have been priorities under Obama as well,"" Kagan said in a telephone interview. ""But the others may indicate the first edge of a new wave of arrests and deportations.""
Trump recently broadened the categories of people who could be targeted for immigration enforcement to anyone who had been charged with a crime, removing an Obama-era exception for people convicted of traffic misdemeanors, Kagan said."

Immigrant rights advocates reported an uptick in Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests ― including the detention of people who were considered low priority for removal until Trump signed an order last month making nearly every undocumented immigrant an important target for deportation.
ICE officials initially said that this week’s actions were “routine” and nothing outside the ordinary. But in a conference call with reporters Friday evening, an ICE official appeared to contradict that statement, saying that the agencies targeted several cities in an “enforcement surge.”

Rep. Joaquín Castro (D-Texas) said ICE’s San Antonio field office told him that South and Central Texas were also targeted as part of an operation called “Cross Check.”

The idea that these operations will become the new normal is exactly what undocumented immigrants are afraid of.
In Austin, Angel Velazquez kissed her boyfriend Hugo before he went to work on Friday morning. He said he’d text her when he got to his job site, like he normally does.
Instead, she got a text a few minutes later in Spanish saying he’d been stopped by immigration authorities. “I was like, ‘Babe, don’t hang up, I’ll be there right away,’” Velazquez told The Huffington Post.
Velazquez, who is a U.S. citizen of Native American descent, rushed with her sister to the place where her boyfriend had been stopped, telling him on the phone as they drove not to answer questions, especially about his immigration status. When they found him, Velazquez said, she asked ICE agents for a warrant, but they responded that they didn’t need one.
Hugo was one of more than a dozen people in the area hauled off to immigrant detention over the last two days. Activists and elected officials in Austin said ICE had stopped undocumented immigrants in traffic, attempted to arrest them in their homes and patrolled the area around an HEB grocery store in the northwestern part of the city.
Roque Planas/The Huffington Post Angel Velazquez wipes tears from her eyes after exiting the courthouse in downtown Austin, Texas. Her boyfriend, Hugo, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Feb. 10, 2017, and now faces deportation.
A Texas-based spokeswoman for ICE declined to specify why the agency had detained any of these immigrants, but Velazquez said Hugo had a DWI ticket on his record.
“The level of ICE enforcement that we’ve seen in the past few weeks is unprecedented,” Stephanie Gharakhanian, an attorney with the Workers Defense Project, told reporters.
Grassroots Leadership, an immigrant rights group, has meanwhile received calls from about 20 different people’s families on its hotline. “I’m connecting them with attorneys,” Alejandro Cáceres, one of the activists fielding the calls, told HuffPost. “I’m telling them not to open their doors.”
One caller told Cáceres that a police officer had accompanied ICE agents to make an arrest ― a seeming contradiction of the “sanctuary” policy that Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez announced last month. Austin Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
ICE’s national office pushed back against the idea that anything was out of the ordinary.
“The rash of recent reports about purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false, dangerous, and irresponsible,” the agency wrote in a statement about detentions in the Los Angeles area. “These reports create panic and put communities and law enforcement personnel in unnecessary danger. Individuals who falsely report such activities are doing a disservice to those they claim to support. “
Still, the agency acknowledged the “enforcement surge” in the Los Angeles area. During the five-day operation, ICE agents detained 160 people, all but 10 with “criminal histories,” according to a statement.
Immigrant rights advocates who keep a close eye on deportations said they’ve seen a clear uptick in arrests in multiple cities, including the deportation of Guadalupe “Lupita” García de Rayos, a mother of two U.S. citizens who came to the country at the age of 14, in Phoenix on Thursday.
In the metro area of Savannah, Georgia, ICE agents picked up 26 people, according to news reports. In Atlanta, an advocate said agents had been knocking on doors in an apartment complex and a trailer park. At least nine men who worked as construction workers were detained at a trailer park in Apple Valley, Minnesota, an activist there said.
United We Dream, an undocumented youth activist group, also received calls about increased deportation activity in Virginia, New York, Oklahoma and Florida, Cristina Jimenez, the group’s executive director, said on a call with reporters.
United We Dream
“This is clearly the first wave of attacks under the Trump administration, and we know that this is not going to be the only one,” Jimenez said.
Some of the arrests are happening in so-called “sanctuary cities,” jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with ICE in some way. Trump said he would pressure these jurisdictions into collaborating with deportation efforts.
Austin City Council member Greg Casar, a progressive Democrat, said he believed the vigorous enforcement efforts are an act of retaliation against local leaders for trying to protect undocumented immigrants.
“This is a drastic shift in ICE actions in our community,” Casar said at a press conference, adding that the city council would respond by considering an emergency appropriation to provide legal services to undocumented immigrants.
Roque Planas/The Huffington Post At a Feb. 10, 2017 press conference, Austin City Councilman Greg Casar said he believed the Trump administration had carried out a series of deportations to retaliate against local leaders for adopting sanctuary policies.
Immigrant rights groups and their allies in public office plan to increase their efforts to protect undocumented immigrants by holding more “know your rights” presentations and raising funds for legal representation, among other things.
Democratic members of Congress condemned the reported ICE raids and said they would do what they could to fight them.
Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.) told HuffPost he doesn’t think it’s a coincidence the crackdown happened this week, as the Trump administration struggled with a roadblock in the courts over its executive order banning refugees and travel from certain Muslim-majority countries.
“This is retaliatory and it is a way to provide political cover ― ‘Look what we’re doing, we’re out there being tough on criminals’ ― when in reality, they’re breaking up families,” Grijalva said. “It’s callous and it’s very, very dangerous.”
Velazquez spent the afternoon in jail herself. When she tried to defend her boyfriend, authorities asked to see her ID. They arrested her on a warrant for an unpaid speeding ticket, she said.
When she left the downtown courthouse on Friday afternoon, she said she felt guilty. She didn’t have to work on Friday. Normally on her days off, she drives Hugo to work. But on Friday, she felt sleepy and asked to stay home and rest.
“I just want him out of jail and just home already,” Velazquez told HuffPost. “I don’t think it’s fair what they’re doing. I don’t see the reason for it.”"

Updated at 7:50 p.m. ET
A federal appeals court has unanimously rejected a Trump administration request to allow its travel ban to take effect.
The three-judge appeals panel declined to overturn a lower court's order suspending the president's ban against entry into the United States by refugees and travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations.
The travel ban was put on hold by federal district Judge James L. Robart of Seattle, who issued a nationwide restraining order on Feb. 3. Robart said that the two states challenging the ban, Washington and Minnesota, had shown that their residents and universities were harmed by Trump's action. The administration then asked the appeals court for an emergency stay of Robart's restraining order.
But the judges dismissed the administration's request, saying that it had to show that it is likely to succeed in the trial court on the merits of its appeal.
""[We] hold that the Government has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal, nor has it shown that failure to enter a stay would cause irreparable injury, and we therefore deny its emergency motion for a stay,"" wrote the panel.
President Trump tweeted his reply, indicating he will appeal.
Trump also spoke briefly with reporters outside his press secretary's office after the ruling was announced and, as reported by Reuters, called the decision political and predicted the administration would ultimately win.
The result is a rebuke to the White House. In oral arguments heard on Tuesday, the panel vigorously quizzed attorneys both for the administration and for the state of Washington, the lead plaintiff, which originally filed the suit challenging the travel ban.
The solicitor general for the state of Washington, Noah Purcell, argued that the travel ban is discriminatory and violates both federal statutes and the U.S. Constitution. He told the court that the judiciary's role is to step in and check the abuses of the executive branch.
But August Flentje, special counsel to the assistant attorney general, argued that the president has the ultimate authority to protect the national security and that his action in that regard — namely, the travel ban — was unreviewable by the courts.
In their ruling, the judges were unequivocal. ""There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our democracy,"" the court wrote.
The judges also said that the administration had also failed to show it would suffer ""irreparable injury"" if its travel ban were not allowed to go back into effect. Acknowledging the government's interest in combating terrorism, the judges nonetheless wrote, ""The Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States. Rather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive Order, the Government has taken the position that we must not review the decision at all.""
The states challenging the president's travel ban won on virtually every issue, says Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.
""The order was unanimous. The panel found that the states had standing, that the executive order was reviewable by the court, that the U.S. was not likely to succeed on the merits and that it had not shown that a stay was necessary to avoid irreparable injury,"" said Tobias.

In a news conference, Purcell declared victory. ""What we argued is it's the role of the courts to say what the law is, and to serve as a check on the executive branch, and that's what the court has done in this opinion, in this excellent opinion, with this well-reasoned, careful, thoughtful opinion that seriously considered all the government's arguments and rejected them,"" he said."
6646,Appeals court maintains block on Trump travel limits from Muslim countries',Washington Times,2/10/2017,,,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/9/trump-travel-ban-muslim-nations-loses-federal-appe/,"A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that President Trump’s extreme vetting executive order is likely illegal, upholding a temporary restraining order that has halted most of the president’s plan and delivering the first serious legal setback of the administration.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the administration bungled the writing of the Jan. 27 executive order by making it too broad and then botched the legal defense in court by failing to back up a number of its claims of expansive presidential powers in the area of national security.
In a unanimous ruling, the judges said that courts must serve as a check on the president, even when he is exercising his national security powers, and that the hassle his order would have caused to citizens, immigrants — both legal and illegal — and their relatives abroad was too much to stomach.
On the other hand, halting the extreme vetting policy while the courts sort out matters wouldn’t harm the government, the judges said.
“The government has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal, nor has it shown that failure to enter a stay would cause irreparable injury, and we therefore deny its emergency motion for a stay,” the 9th Circuit panel wrote.
Mr. Trump’s reaction to the ruling was almost immediate.
“See you in court, the security of our nation is at stake!” he wrote in all capital letters on his Twitter account within a half-hour of the court’s ruling.
The Justice Department wouldn’t tip its legal strategy Thursday and declined to say what Mr. Trump’s tweet meant. A spokeswoman would say only that the department “is reviewing the decision and considering its options.”
The ruling maintains a temporary restraining order imposed by a lower-court judge last week, meaning Mr. Trump cannot carry out most of his policy.
The order halted for 90 days visitors from Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Libya. It also paused the U.S. refugee program for 120 days. Both delays were intended to give the government a chance to improve vetting procedures, officials said.
Some 60,000 visas were canceled and more than 1,000 people were blocked from getting on planes to travel to the U.S. after the order went into effect.
A number of legal challenges were filed, and the Trump administration quickly issued guidance calling for the admittance of green card holders, signifying legal permanent residence, and Iraqis traveling on visas issued in exchange for their help to the U.S. war effort.
Even after those clarifications, the states of Washington and Minnesota filed a lawsuit in Seattle arguing that most of the policy was illegal.
In defending the order, the Trump administration argued that the courts shouldn’t second-guess the president’s national security decisions, particularly in the area of immigration.
But the 9th Circuit panel — which consisted of William Canby Jr., an appointee of President Carter; Richard Clifton, an appointee of President George W. Bush; and Michelle T. Friedland, an appointee of President Obama — shot down that claim.
“There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy,” the judges wrote.
Trump attorneys also said nobody outside the U.S. has a right to a visa.
But Judge James L. Robart, who issued the temporary restraining order Friday, and the 9th Circuit disagreed.
The appeals court said illegal immigrants in the U.S. have some rights, as do relatives living inside the U.S., to facilitate the travel of their families living outside the country. The court also declined to narrow the scope of Judge Robart’s ruling so that it would not apply to those who have never been to the U.S.
“There might be persons covered by the [temporary restraining order] who do not have viable due process claims, but the Government’s proposed revision leaves out at least some who do,” the judges wrote.
The appellate judges said Mr. Trump botched the order on the whole by writing it so broadly and that it wasn’t their job to rewrite the order to make it legal.
An attempt by Mr. Trump’s attorneys to try to clarify his ruling by exempting green card holders was also rejected. The court said it “seems unlikely” that the White House counsel could legally amend or supersede an executive order signed by the president.
The appellate judges noted their own analysis of the case was preliminary and said they would save for later the debate over whether Mr. Trump’s policy amounts to the “Muslim ban” he promised during the campaign — which, if true, would be an unconstitutional infringement on religion, immigrant rights advocates said.
“In light of the sensitive interests involved, the pace of the current emergency proceedings, and our conclusion that the Government has not met its burden of showing likelihood of success on appeal on its arguments with respect to the due process claim, we reserve consideration of these claims until the merits of this appeal have been fully briefed,” the judges wrote.
The case has already been scheduled for a fuller hearing in March. But if the Trump administration appeals this ruling in the meantime, it could seek either an en banc hearing before the full 9th Circuit or take the case to the Supreme Court.
Even without a clear understanding of how the Trump administration would handle the case, observers were quick to react to the ruling.
Immigrant rights advocates cheered it, saying the court stood up for refugees and immigrants.
“The government’s erratic and chaotic attempts to enforce this unconstitutional ban have taken a tremendous toll on innocent individuals, our country’s values, and our standing in the world,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.
Conservatives, though, said the decision was misguided and potentially dangerous.
“No foreigner has a constitutional right to enter the United States and courts ought not second-guess sensitive national security decisions of the president,” said Sen. Tom Cotton, Arkansas Republican. “This misguided ruling is from the 9th Circuit, the most notoriously left-wing court in America and the most reversed court at the Supreme Court. I’m confident the administration’s position will ultimately prevail.”
The seven countries singled out in the policy were not chosen by Mr. Trump. They were based on a 2015 law enacted by Congress and a 2016 determination by the Obama administration that those countries didn’t have enough infrastructure or cooperation with the U.S. for American officials to trust that the people coming from there were who they said they were.
“I’m at a total loss to understand how we can vet people from various countries when in at least four of those countries we don’t even have an embassy,” Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly told Congress this week, defending the executive order.
Thursday’s ruling contrasts with a federal district judge in Boston, who upheld the Trump policy in a decision last week.
That judge ruled that Congress had clearly given the president the power to exclude aliens and said foreigners do not have a right to demand a visa.
“Thus, because an alien does not enjoy a property right in a visa, he has no due process right that protects the manner in which a visa is revoked,” Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton wrote in his opinion.
Mr. Trump this week urged other courts to look to at that ruling.
He also said he listened to oral arguments at the 9th Circuit and was dismayed, saying they strayed far from his focus on keeping the country safe from the threats he sees.
“I listened to lawyers on both sides last night, and they were talking about things that had just nothing to do with it,” he told a law enforcement gathering Wednesday.
Polling on the extreme vetting policy has been confusing. One poll taken by Morning Consult this week showed a clear majority — 54 percent — in favor of the temporary ban on visitors from the seven suspect countries, while a CBS News poll found a majority — 51 percent — to be opposed. A CNN poll put opposition at 53 percent.

3778,Appeals court rejects bid to quickly reinstate travel ban as Trump administration copes with first big setback',Los Angeles Times,2/5/2017,,,http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-visa-cancellations-20170204-story.html,"President Trump grappled Saturday with the first major setback to his young administration, appearing to question the constitutional checks on his power after a judge’s order reopened the flow of travelers from seven mostly Muslim nations covered by his controversial travel ban.
The Department of Homeland Security said Saturday that it had suspended “any and all actions” related to Trump’s executive action after federal Judge James Robart issued a temporary restraining order, effective nationwide, in response to a lawsuit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota. The suit argued that the president’s moves had amounted to religious discrimination against Muslims in violation of the U.S. Constitution.
On Saturday night, the Justice Department said it would appeal the order by Robart, an appointee of President George W. Bush who is now senior judge of the U.S. District for the Western District of Washington.
Early Sunday, the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit denied a request to immediately reinstate Trump’s travel ban, asking both sides to file arguments by Monday.

The issue may eventually end up at the Supreme Court. Several other federal courts have also issued emergency stays against portions of the executive order as dozens of lawsuits proceed against it.
In response to Robart’s restraining order, the State Department, which had “provisionally revoked” 60,000 visas since the president signed his Jan. 27 order, said Saturday that it had started reaccepting those visas from people in the countries affected.
Some travelers in countries affected by the suspension already were being allowed to board planes headed to the U.S., as foreign airlines started telling passengers Saturday that the immigration ban had been lifted. Many rushed to catch flights, worried that the window to travel might soon be closed again by courts.
At the airport in Boston, crowds had gathered at international arrivals to welcome those from the restricted countries. They held signs saying, “Refugees are welcome in the U.S.A,” “Christians build bridges, not walls” and “I am home and so are you.”

“We had more than 40 mostly Iranian nationals land and clear customs today. We’ve had Tunisians and Syrians too, all flying from Germany on Lufthansa,” said Kerry Doyle, an attorney with the American Immigration Lawyers Assn. who was posted at the airport.
Many visa holders had changed their plans to fly to Massachusetts even if it wasn’t their final destination because of an earlier Boston federal judge’s temporary order against Trump’s ban that was being applied locally when the national order came down from Seattle.
“It’s a whole different feeling at the airport than last week,” Doyle said.
Trump’s executive order, which also includes a temporary ban on most refugee admissions and indefinitely for Syrians, was one of several the president has signed since taking office as part of a White House strategy designed to begin implementing his governing vision with maximum impact.

But the torrid pace of action sparked an equally fierce public response that continued Saturday, including protests in Los Angeles and other cities. One march neared the gates of the Palm Beach, Fla., estate being branded as the “Winter White House” where Trump was spending the third weekend of his presidency.
Trump and his advisors had largely downplayed the confusion his order sparked and insisted it was on solid legal ground, even though on Monday he dismissed the acting attorney general who had told Justice Department attorneys to cease defending it in court.
Trump began Saturday with a series of tweets against Robart in which he blasted the “so-called judge” for a “ridiculous” opinion.
“What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?” he asked later in another Twitter message.

Activists and state officials opposed to Trump’s order celebrated. “The law is a powerful thing. It has the ability to hold everyone accountable to it, and that includes the president of the United States,” Washington state Atty. Gen. Bob Ferguson said at a news conference after the court decision.
Democrats seized on Trump’s criticism of the judge as an opening in the emerging Senate confirmation battle over the president’s Supreme Court nominee.
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said Trump’s attack “shows a disdain for an independent judiciary that doesn’t always bend to his wishes.”
With every outburst, Schumer said, Trump just “raises the bar even higher” for federal Judge Neil Gorsuch’s nomination.

Democrats were quick to remind that this was not the first time Trump has singled out a judge, comparing it to his attacks during the campaign on American-born Judge Gonzalo Curiel of San Diego, who Trump said could not be impartial because of his Mexican heritage.
“Now he is attempting to bully and disparage yet another federal judge — this one appointed by a Republican president and confirmed by a Republican Senate — for having the audacity to do his job and apply the rule of the law,” said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, a Democrat and former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “The president’s hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing, it is dangerous.”
Trump’s Republican allies in Congress remained largely silent over the court’s stay, and GOP leaders declined to respond to the president’s attacks on the judge.
Congressional leaders have been furious after being cut out of the White House’s planning and execution of the travel ban, and they continued Saturday scrambling to repair the chaotic rollout. Many lawmakers have been fielding frantic requests from constituents calling their offices and pleading for help for family members, students and others ensnared in the travel ban.

Some of the confusion surrounding Trump’s early moves has been attributed to a tight circle of decision-making in the White House, centered around senior policy advisor Stephen Miller and chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon.
But James Carafano, who oversaw national security planning during Trump’s transition, described a more deliberate approach that flowed from Trump’s own view of a security threat.
“People are kind of in shock and awe of the phenomenon so they’re running around coming up for explanations for it,” said Carafano, a national security and foreign policy analyst for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. “The notion that somehow they could have waited and done more vetting and talked to more people — and what? It would have been less controversial? Give me a break.
“They understood there was going to be some friction, but those things could be worked through,” he said. “And as a matter of fact, you’ve seen them working through this pretty quickly.”

After civil rights groups filed lawsuits on behalf of those who had green cards designating them as permanent legal residents, the Trump administration clarified that green-card holders would be exempt from the travel ban. Government officials also reversed a prior position this week and said that dual citizens who held citizenship from one nation that was not on the restricted list would be exempt, even if they also were citizens of a country on the list.

USA TODAY
Refugees and some foreigners were racing the clock to enter the United States as the Trump administration prepared to press a federal appeals court Monday for reinstatement of its controversial travel ban.
The San Francisco-based court denied the Trump administration's request Sunday but ordered the states of Washington and Minnesota, which filed suit to halt the ban, to provide more details. The Justice Department was told to file its response later Monday.
President Trump issued the travel ban Jan. 27, one week after his inauguration. His executive order suspended entry of all refugees to the U.S. for 120 days, halted admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely and barred entry for three months to citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries — Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.
After days of legal wrangling, federal Judge James Robart in Seattle issued the temporary restraining order Friday night that lifted the ban nationwide. Robart, appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush in 2004, cited ""immediate and irreparable injury as a result of the signing and implementation of the executive order.""
With the ban on hold at least temporarily, people with jeopardized travel plans were on the move. Lebanon's National News Agency reported that airlines operating out of Beirut's Rafik Hariri International Airport allowed people from the seven affected countries to board U.S.-bound planes. In Egypt, Cairo airport officials told the Associated Press that 33 people from Yemen, Syria and Iraq boarded flights Sunday for the United States.
Late Sunday, an Iranian researcher who had been prevented from coming to the United States to do research at Stanford University arrived safely at New York's Kennedy Airport.
Nima Enayati was turned away last week when he tried to fly to New York from Italy, where he's working on a Ph.D.
Enayati said, ""It feels great finally I'm here.""
Enayati is on a visa for three months to conduct research at Stanford working on robotics that will help make surgeries less invasive and cheaper for patients.
The Royal Jordanian airline took a lighter tack, tweeting an ad: ""Fly to the US on RJ now that you're allowed to."" The ad included the words ""Bon voyage!"" with the first word tweaked to look as if it previously said ""ban.""
In Iran, Foreign Minister Mohammad-Javad Zarif reversed an earlier decision and said visas will be granted to American wrestlers to travel to Iran to attend the 2017 Freestyle World Cup, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
The fate of Trump's executive order is far from resolved. Any decision emerging from the appeals court in the coming days is likely to be appealed further, likely up to the Supreme Court. More limited challenges to the ban also are pending in district courts in Massachusetts, New York, Virginia and Hawaii.
The Justice Department, arguing its case Saturday in the appeal, accused Robart of ""judicial second-guessing of the President"" that constitutes an ""impermissible intrusion"" into Trump's authority over who can enter the country.
""This is particularly true as to predictive judgments about the potential national security threat posed by a class of aliens,"" the department said in its appeal. ""A reviewing court would not be well-equipped to ascertain the quantum of risk, or what is a reasonable margin of error in assessing risk.""
Trump was more succinct, tweeting that the ""opinion of this so-called judge"" would ultimately be overturned.
""The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart,"" Trump said on Twitter. ""Bad people are very happy!""
The State Department said it was restoring tens of thousands of canceled visas for foreigners, and the Department of Homeland Security ""suspended all actions"" for enforcing the ban and instead began standard inspection of travelers.

Is Trump's immigration ban headed for the Supreme Court?
The State Department on Saturday advised refugee aid agencies that refugees set to travel before Trump signed the order will now be allowed in. A State Department official said in an email obtained by the Associated Press that the government was ""focusing on booking refugee travel"" through Feb. 17 and working to have arrivals resume as soon as Monday.
Trump's Jan. 27 executive order immediately sparked anger and confusion across the nation. Scores of incoming travelers were held up at U.S. airports, and many more were halted from boarding flights bound for the United States. Protests erupted at airports and city halls nationwide.
The ACLU and other advocacy groups now urge travelers caught in limbo to act quickly. Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, applauded the weekend ruling as ""another stinging rejection of President Trump’s unconstitutional Muslim ban. We will keep fighting to permanently dismantle this un-American executive order.""
Becca Heller, director of the New York-based International Refugee Assistance Project, stressed that previously issued visas would once again be valid unless they were stamped ""canceled.""
""The reinstatement of visas is the only right move to remedy the situation of the last week, which has caused havoc here in the United States and across the world,” Heller said.
The Trump administration had a different take. Vice President Mike Pence made the rounds of the Sunday morning news shows, stressing the importance of the executive order.
“From the outset of his campaign and administration, the president of the United States has made it clear to put the safety of the American people first,"" Pence told Fox News Sunday. ""We are going to win this argument.”
During his Sunday sermon, the Rev. Kevin Ulmet, senior pastor of Nashville First Church of the Nazarene, recounted the African congregation's nearly two-year history. Pastor Jerome Songolo, a refugee who fled the strife-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo, stood beside him, translating his words from English to Swahili.
""I want to say this very clearly: Those whom God wants here God will bring here and no government or president will stop that, because God will do what God will do and his kingdom will advance.""

“From the outset of his campaign and administration, the president of the United States has made it clear to put the safety of the American people first,” Pence said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We are going to win this argument.”
Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27 that temporarily halted immigration from seven mostly Muslim nations and the United States’ Syrian refugee program. The order follows his steadfast argument that radical Islamic terrorism poses a major threat to Americans’ safety.
On Friday, a federal judge in Seattle imposed a temporary restraining order on Trump’s ban, in response to a case filed last week by Washington state and Minnesota challenging Trump’s constitutional authority to unilaterally impose such a sweeping ban.
On Saturday night, a federal appeals court denied a Trump administration request to lift the restraining order and allow the immigration ban to continue.
“Under statutory law and under the Constitution, that authority belongs to the president,” Pence also said Sunday.
California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, told “Fox News Sunday” that she has “no doubt” that the legal issue will ultimately go to the Supreme Court.
Pence also supported the new sanctions Trump imposed on Iran after the country last week launched a medium-range ballistic missile.
“They have flouted the U.N. security resolution,” he said. “What we are seeing here is a hostile action, belligerent action, taken by the Iranians. And we just are not going to put up with it anymore."""

The Facts
The only news report that we could find that referred to a six-month ban was a 2013 ABC News article that included this line: “As a result of the Kentucky case, the State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months in 2011, federal officials told ABC News — even for many who had heroically helped U.S. forces as interpreters and intelligence assets.”
AD
AD
The “Kentucky case” refers to two Iraqis in Kentucky who in May 2011 were arrested and faced federal terrorism charges after officials discovered from an informant that Waad Ramadan Alwan, before he had been granted asylum in the United States, had constructed improvised roadside bombs in Iraq. The FBI, after examining fragments from thousands of bomb parts, found Alwan’s fingerprints on a cordless phone that had been wired to detonate an improvised bomb in 2005.
The arrests caused an uproar in Congress, and the Obama administration pledged to reexamine the records of 58,000 Iraqis who had been settled in the United States. The administration also imposed new, more extensive background checks on Iraqi refugees. Media reports at the time focused on how the new screening procedures had delayed visa approvals, even as the United States was preparing to end its involvement in the Iraq War.
“The enhanced screening procedures have caused a logjam in regular visa admissions from Iraq, even for those who risked their lives to aid American troops and who now fear reprisals as the Obama administration winds down the U.S. military presence,” the Baltimore Sun reported.
AD
AD
The Los Angeles Times reported that U.S. officials acknowledged delays but were trying to speed up the process:
A U.S. Embassy official in Baghdad, speaking on condition he not be identified, acknowledged “unfortunate delays” in issuing special visas, the result of enhanced security clearance procedures, some instituted after the Kentucky arrests. But he said recent changes would speed the process.
The State Department’s National Visa Center has been ordered to flag special visa applications for expedited action, the official said. And a requirement that Iraqi applicants provide an original signature on certain forms sent to the U.S. has been dropped after Iraqis complained of logistical difficulties. “We are making changes, ordered at the very highest levels, that will help shave time off the application process,” the official said.
At a September 2011 congressional hearing, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) asked Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano if a hold had been placed on Iraqi visa applications.
COLLINS: “So my question is, is there a hold on that population until they can be more stringently vetted to ensure that we’re not letting into this country, people who would do us harm?” NAPOLITANO: “Yep. Let me, if I might, answer your question two parts. First part, with respect to the 56, 57,000 who were resettled pursuant to the original resettlement program, they have all been revetted against all of the DHS databases, all of the NCTC [National Counter Terrorism Center] databases and the Department of Defense’s biometric databases and so that work has now been done and focused.” COLLINS: “That’s completed?” NAPOLITANO: “That is completed. Moving forward, no one will be resettled without going through the same sort of vet. Now I don’t know if that equates to a hold, as you say, but I can say that having done the already resettled population moving forward, they will all be reviewed against those kinds of databases.”
The new rules were stringent, the Economist reported, and resulted in some turmoil.
“Immigration authorities soon began rechecking all Iraqi refugees in America, reportedly comparing fingerprints and other records with military and intelligence documents in dusty archives. About 1,000 soon-to-be immigrants in Iraq were told that they would not be allowed to board flights already booked. Some were removed from planes. Thousands more Iraqi applicants had to restart the immigration process, because their security clearances expired when the program stalled. Men must now pass five separate checks, women four, and children three.”
State Department records show there was a significant drop in refugee arrivals from Iraq in 2011. There were 18,251 in 2010, 6,339 in 2011 and 16,369 in 2012. But it’s unclear that equates to an actual six-month pause in visa processing, rather than a dramatic slowdown in approvals as new rules were put in place. One news report said “pace of visa approvals having slowed to a crawl,” indicating some were still being approved.
AD
Update: Former Obama administration official Jon Finer denied that any ban in Iraqi refugee admissions was put in place under Obama. “While the flow of Iraqi refugees slowed significantly during the Obama administration’s review, refugees continued to be admitted to the United States during that time, and there was not a single month in which no Iraqis arrived here,” he wrote in Foreign Policy. “In other words, while there were delays in processing, there was no outright ban.”
AD
Another former official, Eric P. Schwartz, the assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration at the time, also told The Fact Checker that Trump’s statement is false:
“President Obama never imposed a six-month ban on Iraqi processing. For several months in 2011, there was a lower level of Iraqi resettlement, as the government implemented certain security enhancements. Indeed, as we identified new and valuable opportunities to enhance screening, we did so. Nobody should object to a continual effort to identify legitimate enhancements, but it is disreputable to use that as a pretext to effectively shut down a program that is overwhelmingly safe and has enabled the United States to exercise world leadership. In any event, there was never a point during that period in which Iraqi resettlement was stopped, or banned.”
The Pinocchio Test
AD
So what’s the difference with Trump’s action?
First, Obama responded to an actual threat — the discovery that two Iraqi refugees had been implicated in bombmaking in Iraq that had targeted U.S. troops. (Iraq, after all, was a war zone.) Under congressional pressure, officials decided to reexamine all previous refugees and impose new screening procedures, which led to a slowdown in processing new applications. Trump, by contrast, issued his executive order without any known triggering threat. (His staff has pointed to attacks unrelated to the countries named in his order.)
Second, Obama did not announce a ban on visa applications. In fact, as seen in Napolitano’s answer to Collins, administration officials danced around that question. There was certainly a lot of news reporting that visa applications had slowed to a trickle. But the Obama administration never said it had a policy to halt all applications. Indeed, it is now clear that no ban was put in place. Even so, the delays did not go unnoticed, so there was a lot of critical news reporting at the time about the angst of Iraqis waiting for approval.
AD
AD
Third, Obama’s policy did not prevent all citizens of that country, including green-card holders, from traveling to the United States. Trump’s policy is much more sweeping, though officials have appeared to pull back from barring permanent U.S. residents.
We have sought comment from the White House and from Obama administration officials and so may update this if more information becomes available. But so far this is worthy of at least Two Pinocchios.
Update: In light of the response from Obama administration officials that there never was a point when Iraqi resettlement was stopped or banned, we are updating this ruling to Three Pinocchios. Iraqi refugee processing was slowed, in response to a specific threat, but it was not halted. The Trump White House, meanwhile, has failed to provide any evidence for its statement.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Anadolu Agency/Getty Images Anadolu Agency/Getty Images
President Trump's executive order on immigration late Friday ignited nationwide protests — and a slew of legal challenges.
At least four federal judges across the country have blocked part of the order and temporarily ensured refugees and travelers who reached U.S. soil would not be deported.
Here's an explanation of what happened so far and what could come next.
1. Who is covered by the executive order?
The order suspended new refugee admissions for 120 days. It capped the total number of refugees allowed into the country this year at 50,000, far lower than the Obama administration had allotted. And travelers from seven countries — Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia — are barred for 90 days. Border Patrol agents and lawyers said the order and statements by top White House officials have not made clear how Green Card holders, or lawful permanent residents, are to be treated.
2. What have the federal courts ruled so far?
The American Civil Liberties Union sued in Brooklyn over the detention of two Iraqi clients at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Late Saturday, Judge Ann Donnelly issued a temporary restraining order barring the deportation of as many as 200 people. Judge Donnelly cited ""irreparable harm"" they would face, and she demanded that the Trump administration provide a list of all affected refugees and travelers. Later, a federal judge in suburban Virginia ordered that travelers be allowed to consult with volunteer attorneys. And another judge in Massachusetts ruled the travelers not only were free from deportation, but that those being held must be released from federal detention. There are reports from pro bono lawyers that border agents may not be complying with some of those directives from the federal judiciary.
3. What is the Trump administration saying about this?
White House officials said the policy is designed to protect U.S. borders and to restrict the entry of terrorism suspects. The Department of Homeland Security said fewer than 1 percent of the average 325,000 people who journeyed to the U.S. on Saturday were ""inconvenienced."" DHS said the president's order remains in place and ""the U.S. government retains its right to revoke visas at any time if required for national security or public safety.""
On NBC's Meet The Press on Sunday, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said Green Card holders would not be affected ""moving forward,"" but he went on to say that they would ""be subjected to further screening"" at the border.
4. Where do the legal challenges go from here?
The president has sweeping authority on matters of immigration. Federal law allows the president to suspend people or classes of people if he determines their entry is ""detrimental"" to the nation. But a 1965 update to that law, the Immigration and Naturalization Act, clarifies that people should not experience preferences or discrimination on account of their ""race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence.""
Trump's order appears to grant some religious preference to Christians and to target seven majority-Muslim countries, though his order points out that people from those countries had already been singled out for extra vetting during the Obama years.
Lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, immigrants rights groups and other advocates are likely to file more lawsuits in the coming days on the grounds that the order violates the 1965 immigration law, the right to due process, and the First Amendment clause that bars Congress from establishing a religion, among other things.
White House officials insisted they did not set out to create a ""Muslim ban."" But Trump associate Rudy Giuliani told Fox News that Trump had reached out to him and others about how to make such a ban, which Trump proposed on the campaign trail in December 2015, legal. And the son of national security adviser Michael Flynn tweeted about a ""Muslim ban,"" as well. Those statements could be used by refugee advocates to demonstrate the administration's intent.
5. What happens with Trump's nominees for key Cabinet posts?
Democrats argue that key offices within the State Department and the Justice Department were in the dark about the immigration order before it was made public. They want to know if Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions, the nominee to be attorney general, advised Trump on the order — and whether Sessions will commit to making sure Justice Department lawyers are consulted in the future. The Senate Judiciary Committee is supposed to vote on Sessions' nomination on Tuesday. If he passes that vote, Sessions could be confirmed by the full Senate by the end of the week."

The hysterical rhetoric about President Trump’s executive order on refugees is out of control. Let’s slow down and take a look at the facts.
To read the online commentary, one would think that President Trump just fundamentally corrupted the American character. You would think that the executive order on refugees he signed yesterday betrayed America’s Founding ideals. You might even think he banned people from an entire faith from American shores.
Just look at the rhetoric. Here’s Chuck Schumer:

CNN, doing its best Huffington Post impersonation, ran a headline declaring “Trump bans 134,000,000 from the U.S.” The Huffington Post, outdoing itself, just put the Statue of Liberty upside down on its front page.

So, what did Trump do? Did he implement his promised Muslim ban? No, far from it. He backed down dramatically from his campaign promises and instead signed an executive order dominated mainly by moderate refugee restrictions and temporary provisions aimed directly at limiting immigration from jihadist conflict zones.
Let’s analyze the key provisions, separate the fact from the hysteria, and introduce just a bit of historical perspective.
First, the order temporarily halts refugee admissions for 120 days to improve the vetting process, then caps refugee admissions at 50,000 per year. Outrageous, right? Not so fast. Before 2016, when Obama dramatically ramped up refugee admissions, Trump’s 50,000 stands roughly in between a typical year of refugee admissions in George W. Bush’s two terms and a typical year in Obama’s two terms. The chart below, from the Migration Policy Institute, is instructive:
In 2002, the United States admitted only 27,131 refugees. It admitted fewer than 50,000 in 2003, 2006, and 2007. As for President Obama, he was slightly more generous than President Bush, but his refugee cap from 2013 to 2015 was a mere 70,000, and in 2011 and 2012 he admitted barely more than 50,000 refugees himself.
The bottom line is that Trump is improving security screening and intends to admit refugees at close to the average rate of the 15 years before Obama’s dramatic expansion in 2016. Obama’s expansion was a departure from recent norms, not Trump’s contraction.
Second, the order imposes a temporary, 90-day ban on people entering the U.S. from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. These are countries either torn apart by jihadist violence or under the control of hostile, jihadist governments.
Advertisement

The ban is in place while the Department of Homeland Security determines the “information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or public-safety threat.” It could, however, be extended or expanded depending on whether countries are capable of providing the requested information.
The ban, however, contains an important exception: “Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked.” In other words, the secretaries can make exceptions — a provision that would, one hopes, fully allow interpreters and other proven allies to enter the U.S. during the 90-day period.
To the extent this ban applies to new immigrant and non-immigrant entry, this temporary halt (with exceptions) is wise. We know that terrorists are trying to infiltrate the ranks of refugees and other visitors. We know that immigrants from Somalia, for example, have launched jihadist attacks here at home and have sought to leave the U.S. to join ISIS.

Indeed, given the terrible recent track record of completed and attempted terror attacks by Muslim immigrants, it’s clear that our current approach is inadequate to control the threat. Unless we want to simply accept Muslim immigrant terror as a fact of American life, a short-term ban on entry from problematic countries combined with a systematic review of our security procedures is both reasonable and prudent.
However, there are reports that the ban is being applied even to green-card holders. This is madness. The plain language of the order doesn’t apply to legal permanent residents of the U.S., and green-card holders have been through round after round of vetting and security checks. The administration should intervene, immediately, to stop misapplication. If, however, the Trump administration continues to apply the order to legal permanent residents, it should indeed be condemned.

Third, Trump’s order also puts an indefinite hold on admission of Syrian refugees to the United States “until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest.” This is perhaps the least consequential aspect of his order — and is largely a return to the Obama administration’s practices from 2011 to 2014. For all the Democrats’ wailing and gnashing of teeth, until 2016 the Obama administration had already largely slammed the door on Syrian-refugee admissions.
The Syrian Civil War touched off in 2011. Here are the Syrian-refugee admissions to the U.S. until Obama decided to admit more than 13,000 in 2016:
Advertisement
Fiscal Year 2011: 29
Fiscal Year 2012: 31
Fiscal Year 2013: 36
Fiscal Year 2014: 105
Fiscal Year 2015: 1,682
To recap: While the Syrian Civil War was raging, ISIS was rising, and refugees were swamping Syria’s neighbors and surging into Europe, the Obama administration let in less than a trickle of refugees. Only in the closing days of his administration did President Obama reverse course — in numbers insufficient to make a dent in the overall crisis, by the way — and now the Democrats have the audacity to tweet out pictures of bleeding Syrian children?
It’s particularly gross to see this display when the Obama administration’s deliberate decision to leave a yawning power vacuum — in part through its Iraq withdrawal and in part through its dithering throughout the Syrian Civil War — exacerbated the refugee crisis in the first place. There was a genocide on Obama’s watch, and his tiny trickle of Syrian refugees hardly makes up for the grotesque negligence of abandoning Iraq and his years-long mishandling of the emerging Syrian crisis.
Advertisement
When we know our enemy is seeking to strike America and its allies through the refugee population, when we know they’ve succeeded in Europe, and when the administration has doubts about our ability to adequately vet the refugees we admit into this nation, a pause is again not just prudent but arguably necessary. It is important that we provide sufficient aid and protection to keep refugees safe and healthy in place, but it is not necessary to bring Syrians to the United States to fulfill our vital moral obligations.
Fourth, there is a puzzling amount of outrage over Trump’s directive to “prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual’s country of nationality.” In other words, once refugee admissions resume, members of minority religions may well go to the front of the line. In some countries, this means Christians and Yazidis. In others, it can well mean Muslims.
Sadly, during the Obama administration it seems that Christians and other minorities may well have ended up in the back of the line. For example, when Obama dramatically expanded Syrian refugee admissions in 2016, few Christians made the cut:
The Obama administration has resettled 13,210 Syrian refugees into the United States since the beginning of 2016 — an increase of 675 percent over the same 10-month period in 2015. Of those, 13,100 (99.1 percent) are Muslims — 12,966 Sunnis, 24 Shi’a, and 110 other Muslims — and 77 (0.5 percent) are Christians. Another 24 (0.18 percent) are Yazidis.
Advertisement
As a point of reference, in 2015 Christians represented roughly 10 percent of Syria’s population. Perhaps there’s an innocent explanation for the disparity. Perhaps not. But one thing is clear — federal asylum and refugee law already require a religious test. As my colleague Andy McCarthy has repeatedly pointed out, an alien seeking asylum “must establish that . . . religion [among other things] . . . was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.”
Similarly, the term “refugee” means “(A) any person who is outside any country of such person’s nationality . . . and who is unable or unwilling to return to . . . that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of . . . religion [among other things] . . . [.]”
But don’t tell CNN’s chief national security correspondent, who last night tweeted this:
There is no basis to the claim Muslim refugees were prioritized over Christians. Fact is, refugee policy not based in religion, until now. — Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) January 28, 2017
False. False. False. Religious considerations are by law part of refugee policy. And it is entirely reasonable to give preference (though not exclusivity) to members of minority religions.
Finally, you can read the entire executive order from start to finish, reread it, then read it again, and you will not find a Muslim ban. It’s not there. Nowhere. At its most draconian, it temporarily halts entry from jihadist regions. In other words, Trump’s executive order is a dramatic climb-down from his worst campaign rhetoric.
You can read the entire executive order from start to finish, reread it, then read it again, and you will not find a Muslim ban. It’s not there. Nowhere.
To be sure, however, the ban is deeply problematic as applied to legal residents of the U.S. and to interpreters and other allies seeking refuge in the United States after demonstrated (and courageous) service to the United States. Twitter timelines are coming alive with stories of Iraqi interpreters who’ve saved American lives. Few have bled more in alliance with America than Iraq’s Kurds, but the order itself provides for the necessary case-by-case exemptions to the temporary blanket bans. It is vital that General John Kelly, the newly confirmed secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, move expeditiously to protect those who’ve laid down their lives in the war against ISIS, al-Qaeda, and the Taliban. Given his own wartime experience, I believe and hope that he will.
Trump’s order was not signed in a vacuum. Look at the Heritage Foundation’s interactive timeline of Islamist terror plots since 9/11. Note the dramatic increase in planned and executed attacks since 2015. Now is not the time for complacency. Now is the time to take a fresh look at our border-control and immigration policies. Trump’s order isn’t a betrayal of American values. Applied correctly and competently, it can represent a promising fresh start and a prelude to new policies that protect our nation while still maintaining American compassion and preserving American friendships."

SAN FRANCISCO — President Trump's order banning immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. began hitting the tech industry Saturday, with Google's CEO leading a growing list of tech executives condemning the ban.
The CEOs of Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, Uber, Airbnb and Tesla Motors denounced with the policy, which would affect their own employees working here legally, as well as their competitive quest for talent.
Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky went a step further, offering free housing to anyone displaced by the ban.
Several tech leaders expressed concern that the ban could wreak havoc on their businesses.
""Trump's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world, and are so un-American it pains us all,"" Netflix CEO and founder Reed Hastings said in a Facebook post. ""It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.""
In a staff memo, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the move affects at least 187 of the Internet giant's staff.
""We’re concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S.,"" Google said in a statement. ""We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere.""
The president's executive order suspends the entry of all refugees to the United States for 120 days, halts the admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely and bars entry for three months to residents from the predominantly Muslim countries of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.

World blasts Trump's move, although some do cheer it
Q&A: How many refugees does the U.S. admit?
The order made good on one of Trump's most controversial campaign promises, a series of Muslim-focused restrictions he says should prevent terrorists from entering U.S. soil. For many of his supporters, preventing or delaying legal immigrants from returning to high-paid tech jobs, which they say should go to U.S.-born workers anyway, is a small price to pay for the promise of more security.
The move is already roiling the tech industry, with affected employees being urged to return to the U.S. and consult with corporate immigration experts.
Internet Association President and CEO Michael Beckerman said the Internet industry is ""deeply concerned"" by Trump's order.
""While this order impacts many companies outside of the tech industry, Internet companies in particular thrive in the U.S. because the best and the brightest are able to create innovative products and services right here in America,"" Beckerman said in an emailed statement. ""While we support President Trump’s efforts to grow our economy and allow ‘people of great talent’ to come into the U.S., the executive order signed yesterday has troubling consequences.""
The ban includes green card holders who are authorized to live and work in the United States, according to a Homeland Security spokeswoman, Reuters reported. Some immigrants with legal visas trying to return to the U.S. from trips abroad were also detained, according to news reports.
""The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country’s challenges,"" Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and an adviser to President Trump said on Twitter. ""Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the U.S. They've done right, not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected.""
In a memo sent to Google employees first reported by Bloomberg News and the Wall Street Journal, Pichai said one employee was rushing back from a trip to New Zealand before the order was assigned, while two others were grappling with what this might mean to their families.
A similar situation was playing out at other tech companies.
Microsoft: We share the concerns
Microsoft said it's providing legal advice and assistance to its employees affected by the executive order.
""We share the concerns about the impact of the executive order on our employees from the listed countries, all of whom have been in the United States lawfully,"" the tech giant said in a statement.
According to Microsoft's general counsel Brad Smith, 76 Microsoft employees are citizens with a U.S. visa from the affected countries.
""We’ve already contacted everyone in this group,"" he told employees in a memo. ""But there may be other employees from these countries who have U.S. green cards rather than a visa who may be affected, and there may be family members from these countries that we haven’t yet reached.""
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a LinkedIn post that his company would ""continue to advocate on this important topic.""
""As an immigrant and as a CEO, I’ve both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world,"" Nadella said.
Uber's Kalanick: I'll talk to Trump
Uber CEO Travis Kalanick told employees he would raise the immigration ban on Friday when he takes part in President Trump's first business advisory group meeting.
""While every government has their own immigration controls, allowing people from all around the world to come here and make America their home has largely been the U.S.’s policy since its founding. That means this ban will impact many innocent people,"" Kalanick said.
Cook: Apple wouldn't exist without immigration
Apple CEO Tim Cook was in Washington, D.C., where he has been meeting with GOP lawmakers and with Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner.
In a memo to employees, he said ""it is not a policy we support.""
""In my conversations with officials here in Washington this week, I’ve made it clear that Apple believes deeply in the importance of immigration — both to our company and to our nation’s future. Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do,"" Cook wrote, according to a memo sent to employees worldwide and obtained by USA TODAY. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant.
Box: Looking at how to fight this legally
For Box CEO Aaron Levie, the Trump order also hit home. One of the founders of the cloud-based storage and services company is Iranian-American and Box is currently trying to assess how many of its employees are affected.
""At the corporate level, we are trying to take inventory on who could be impacted and ensuring that they stay within the country for now,"" Levie said. ""We are really just getting a handle on the legal side of the situation, what we can fight and ultimately how we protect employees in the process.""
More broadly, the order sends ""the wrong moral message to the world and within our own country,"" Levie said, turning away refugees and doing nothing to make Americans safer. ""It's very unfortunate and very disappointing,"" he said.
Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield also condemned the immigration ban.
""Immigration is unambiguously an economic benefit, but, doesn't matter: do the right thing because it's right,"" he wrote in a series of posts on Twitter. ""My grandfather came from Poland between the wars, at 17, sponsored by an elder sister. Two more siblings made it. Everyone else died.""
Technology investor Chris Sacca pledged to match donations to the American Civil Liberties Union up to $25,000 and then quickly raised it to $50,000. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, say they have either filed lawsuits or will do so shortly challenging the ban.
""The @aclu took Trump to court. Let's stand with them,"" he tweeted.
With protests spreading to airports on Saturday, Sam Altman, president of Silicon Valley tech incubator Y Combinator, urged the tech industry to speak up.
""It is time for tech companies to start speaking up about some of the actions taken by President Trump’s administration,"" Altman said in a blog post. ""The tech community is powerful. Large tech companies in particular have enormous power and are held in high regard. We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally. Although there is some business risk in doing so, there is strength in numbers—if everyone does it early this coming week, we will all make each other stronger.""
Past tensions
Immigrants account for a significant part of the workforce in the tech industry, which has for years advocated loosening laws to increase the flow of skilled immigrants into the U.S. With its heavy reliance on the H-1B visa program that allows software engineers and other skilled workers to work in the U.S., Silicon Valley fears what immigration restrictions will come from the Trump administration.
Trump's perspective on immigrants, and Muslims in particular, has caused tensions between the White House and Silicon Valley. Tech executives and workers have denounced the president's anti-Muslim views and some have pledged not to help build Trump's proposed Muslim registry.
On Saturday, Chesky pushed back against Trump's executive order in a tweet. ""Open doors brings all of U.S. together. Closing doors further divides U.S.,"" he wrote. ""Let's all find ways to connect people, not separate them.""
In a Facebook post, he offered free housing, even providing his personal email address. ""We have 3M homes, so we can definitely find people a place to stay,"" he write.
Thiel in focus again
Some in Silicon Valley have direct ties to the Trump administration. Peter Thiel, a Trump transition team member, sits on the board of Facebook and he's a part-time partner at Y Combinator. He's an investor in many companies including Airbnb.
A Facebook employee of Middle Eastern descent told BuzzFeed News that some Facebook employees want the company to ""clarify"" its relationship with Thiel.
“There are questions here that we want answered. Does Thiel support this ban?"" the person said. ""Does he think the Facebook employees who come from Iran and those other countries shouldn’t be allowed to keep working here? We deserve to know his position on this.”
Uber's Kalanick said his policy is to engage with Trump.
""We partner around the world optimistically in the belief that by speaking up and engaging we can make a difference. Our experience is that not doing so shortchanges cities and the people who live in them. This is why I agreed in early December to join President Trump’s economic advisory group,"" he told employees. ""I understand that many people internally and externally may not agree with that decision, and that’s OK. It's the magic of living in America that people are free to disagree.""
The growing number of public statements from technology leaders was unusual, a measure of the perceived threat to their businesses and to their own political beliefs.
""As a tech leader and public CEO, I’m often advised to stay apolitical,"" Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson wrote in a Medium post. ""But this isn’t politics, I believe this is a matter of objective right and wrong. Staying silent doesn’t feel like leadership to me. I encourage other leaders to consider the cost of silence.""
Google's Pichai was the second executive of a major tech company to speak out against Trump's immigration order. Earlier Friday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was concerned about the immigration order's reach.
Zuckerberg 'concerned' about Trump immigration plan
""Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don't pose a threat will live in fear of deportation,"" he wrote on his Facebook page.
In a statement on Saturday, Facebook said: ""We are assessing the impact on our workforce and determining how best to protect our people and their families from any adverse effects.""
Trump's executive order suspends the entry of Syrian refugees into U.S.
Trump's stance on immigration was one of the key reasons the tech industry widely opposed Trump's candidacy. Many of tech's most successful companies have been founded or are run by immigrants, and the industry employs thousands of immigrants, often from Asian countries.
After Trump's win, tech executives from Google, Facebook, Amazon and others met with the president-elect in a summit seen as a pragmatic move to find some common ground with the new administration. Tech leaders were largely silent as Trump has rapidly signed orders in his first week in office.
That changed later in the week. Facebook COO and and Lean In author Sheryl Sandberg also broke her silence, taking to Facebook to criticize the order that would bar funding to overseas healthcare providers that give abortion counseling.
Sheryl Sandberg slams Trump's anti-abortion action: 'It'll hurt more people'"
3020,A (very short) list of Republicans in Congress who have criticized Trump\xe2\x80\x99s immigration order',Vox,1/29/2017,,,http://www.vox.com/2017/1/28/14427198/republican-critics-trump-refugee-order,"Most Republicans in Congress have been either quiet or generally supportive of Donald Trump’s controversial new executive order barring US entry for natives of seven Muslim-majority countries. That includes House Speaker Paul Ryan, who denounced the idea of a Muslim ban during the campaign only to turn around and back this decision.
There are, however, some exceptions. Below are 16 Republicans who have criticized Trump’s immigration order since Friday. Note that most of them support the idea of sharper travel restrictions from certain countries. They’ve just attacked Trump’s order as overly broad and poorly executed — noting, for instance, that it was catching green card holders and causing chaos at airports all day Saturday. (On Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security finally said green-card holders could enter the US.)
Some of the critics, like Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), are merely calling on Trump to review and revise parts of the order, whereas Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham had much broader complaints, saying “we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.”
1) Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA)
Dent, whose district has one of the largest Syrian refugee populations in the country, called on Trump to halt the immigration order on Saturday afternoon, telling the New York Times: “I urge the administration to halt enforcement of this order until a more thoughtful and deliberate policy can be instated.”
Dent later expanded on his comments in an interview with the Washington Post: “This is ridiculous. I guess I understand what his intention is, but unfortunately the order appears to have been rushed through without full consideration. You know, there are many, many nuances of immigration policy that can be life or death for many innocent, vulnerable people around the world.”
2) Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ)
Flake singled out the fact that Trump’s order was so broad that up to 500,000 green card holders — permanent residents of the United States — would be barred from returning to America if they went abroad:
President Trump and his administration are right to be concerned about national security, but it's unacceptable when even legal permanent residents are being detained or turned away at airports and ports of entry. Enhancing long term national security requires that we have a clear-eyed view of radical Islamic terrorism without ascribing radical Islamic terrorist views to all Muslims.
3) Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC)
The two senators released a joint statement on Sunday calling the order a “self-inflicted wound” and saying that “it sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country.” And: “we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security”:
Our government has a responsibility to defend our borders, but we must do so in a way that makes us safer and upholds all that is decent and exceptional about our nation. It is clear from the confusion at our airports across the nation that President Trump’s executive order was not properly vetted. We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security. Such a hasty process risks harmful results. We should not stop green-card holders from returning to the country they call home. We should not stop those who have served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to help. And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation, and who have suffered unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children. Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism. At this very moment, American troops are fighting side-by-side with our Iraqi partners to defeat ISIL. But this executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies. Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred. This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.
4) Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN)
On Sunday evening, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee put out a statement calling the order “poorly implemented” and urging Trump to “make appropriate revisions.” That said, Corker did want “many of these programs” ultimately reinstated:
""We all share a desire to protect the American people, but this executive order has been poorly implemented, especially with respect to green card holders. The administration should immediately make appropriate revisions, and it is my hope that following a thorough review and implementation of security enhancements that many of these programs will be improved and reinstated.""
5) Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE)
Sasse, a Trump critic throughout the campaign, issued a statement criticizing the order as “too broad” — and expressed worry that it sent the dangerous message that “the US sees all Muslims as jihadis”:
The President is right to focus attention on the obvious fact that borders matter. At the same time, while not technically a Muslim ban, this order is too broad. There are two ways to lose our generational battle against jihadism by losing touch with reality. The first is to keep pretending that jihadi terrorism has no connection to Islam or to certain countries. That’s been a disaster. And here's the second way to fail: If we send a signal to the Middle East that the U.S. sees all Muslims as jihadis, the terrorist recruiters win by telling kids that America is banning Muslims and that this is America versus one religion. Both approaches are wrong, and both will make us less safe. Our generational fight against jihadism requires wisdom.
6) Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI)
On Twitter, the libertarian-leaning Amash criticized the order as an overreach, arguing that Trump should work with Congress to change immigration policy. Amash also singled out the fact that the order could target green card holders and argued that the list of countries targeted were “more about politics than safety”:
1/ Like Pres. Obama's executive actions on immigration, Pres. Trump's executive order overreaches and undermines our constitutional system. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) January 28, 2017
2/ It's not lawful to ban immigrants on basis of nationality. If the president wants to change immigration law, he must work with Congress. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) January 28, 2017
3/ The president's denial of entry to lawful permanent residents of the United States (green card holders) is particularly troubling. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) January 28, 2017
4/ Green card holders live in the United States as our neighbors and serve in our Armed Forces. They deserve better. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) January 28, 2017
5/ We must do much more to properly vet refugees, but a blanket ban represents an extreme approach not consistent with our nation's values. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) January 28, 2017
6/ While EO allows admittance of immigrants, nonimmigrants, and refugees ""on a case-by-case basis,"" arbitrariness would violate Rule of Law. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) January 28, 2017
7/ EO appears to be more about politics than safety. If concern is radicalism/terrorism, then what about Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and others? — Justin Amash (@justinamash) January 28, 2017
8/ Finally, we can't effectively fight homegrown Islamic radicalism by perpetuating “us vs. them” mindset that terrorists use to recruit. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) January 28, 2017
9/ We must ensure U.S. remains dedicated to Constitution, Rule of Law, and liberty. Capitalism creates prosperity and improves assimilation. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) January 28, 2017
7) Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)
Collins said that Trump’s order “is overly broad and implementing it will be immediately problematic.” Here are her comments to the Maine Sun-Journal:
[Collins] said, for example, “it could interfere with the immigration of Iraqis who worked for American forces in Iraq as translators and bodyguards — people who literally saved the lives of our troops and diplomats during the last decade and whose lives are at risk if they remain in Iraq.
8) Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH)
On Sunday, Portman said on CNN that he supported the two federal judges who had stepped in and temporarily stayed the order, blocking deportations of those who had already arrived in the country. “This was an extreme vetting program that wasn't properly vetted,"" he said.
In particular, he pointed to the fact that a doctor at the Cleveland Clinic — a citizen of Sudan who had been traveling back to the United States — had been detained in New York on Saturday and sent back to the Middle East. Portman said she had already been fully vetted and shouldn’t have been blocked.
Portman went on to say that he supported tighter travel restrictions, arguing that there is “not adequate screening, particularly on our visa waiver program, so I do think we need to tighten things up.” But, he added, Congress should be involved in changing the policies here, not just the White House: “We ought to be part of it. We've been working on this.”
9) Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN)
Here’s Alexander’s statement — he notes that the order isn’t “explicitly a religious test,” but “it comes close”:
The vetting proposal itself needed more vetting. More scrutiny of those traveling from war-torn countries to the United States is wise. But this broad and confusing order seems to ban legal, permanent residents with ""green cards,"" and might turn away Iraqis, for example, who were translators and helped save lives of American troops and who could be killed if they stay in Iraq. And while not explicitly a religious test, it comes close to one which is inconsistent with our American character.
10) Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-WA)
On Sunday, Newhouse put out a statement saying that the order was “needlessly disrupt[ing]” people’s lives and called on the administration to review it:
It is reasonable to conduct a review of prospective and existing visa holders and refugees to make sure they do not pose a security risk. However, the manner in which this Order is being implemented at airports and other points of entry appears that some innocent people, including some who have performed brave and valuable service to our anti-terror efforts, are having their lives needlessly disrupted. I encourage the administration to review its order in consultation with its national security team to ensure our enforcement resources are being targeted where they can be most effective and to allow those law-abiding green card holders and visa holders who clearly aren't a threat to security to return to their jobs and communities here in America.
11) Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-VA)
Statement here: “The president’s Executive Order [goes] beyond the increased vetting actions that Congress has supported on a bipartisan basis and inexplicably applied to Green Card holders. This should be addressed and corrected expeditiously.”
12) Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY)
Statement here: “Our first role as the federal government is to protect our national security and I believe we need to work in Congress to reform and strengthen our visa vetting process. However, I oppose President Trump's rushed and overly broad Executive Order. On the House Armed Services Committee, I have advocated for Iraqi and Afghans who have served side by side as our allies to be prioritized to access visas.”
13) Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA)
""The president's policy entirely misses the mark,"" Fitzpatrick told the Philadelphia Inquirer. “The reality is, terrorism inspired by radicalism and hate is global in scope and, as such, requires a comprehensive response, not a purely regional focus. While serious actions are needed to protect our country, these must not be done in a way that singles out any specific nations or ethnicities.""
14) Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL)
“I object to the suspension of visas from the seven named countries because we could have accomplished our objective of keeping our homeland safe by immediate implementation of more thorough screening procedures,” Ros-Lehtinen told the Miami Herald.
15) Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-FL)
US permanent residents shouldn't be detained, deported, or discriminated against. They've already been thoroughly vetted #executiveorders — Carlos Curbelo (@carloslcurbelo) January 29, 2017
A few other Republicans (like Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman and Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford) have put out more ambiguous statements that could be read as obliquely criticizing the order but don’t explicitly call out Trump.
Most Republicans are still silent or falling in line
But those opponents are still in the minority (at least so far). The GOP leadership in Congress has largely lined up behind Trump on this — or at least stayed very quiet.
It’s a stark contrast to the campaign, when Trump got a fair amount of pushback from his own party for proposing a ban on all Muslim immigration. In June 2016, Paul Ryan denounced that idea at a press conference: ""I do not think it is reflective of our principles, not just as a party, but as a country. And I think the smarter way to go in all respects is to have a security test, not a religious test. I do not think a Muslim ban is in our country's interest.”
But Ryan has decided to support this latest order. Here was his statement on Friday:
Our number one responsibility is to protect the homeland. We are a compassionate nation, and I support the refugee resettlement program, but it’s time to reevaluate and strengthen the visa vetting process. This is why we passed bipartisan legislation in the wake of the Paris attacks to pause the intake of refugees. President Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country.
So why the about-face? Ryan’s spokesperson AshLee Strong told the Post that Trump’s newest order was different from what he’d proposed on the trail: “This is not a religious test and it is not a ban on people of any religion.”
Technically, Trump’s executive order is different from his earlier proposal. It temporarily bars entry for immigrants and visa holders from seven Muslim-majority countries — Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen — rather than targeting all Muslim immigrants everywhere. But given that Rudy Giuliani is telling Fox News that this order came about because Trump wanted help crafting a legal “Muslim ban,” it’s hard not to read into the intent here. As Alexander notes: “While not explicitly a religious test, it comes close to one which is inconsistent with our American character.” And as McCain and Graham note, the order “sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country.”
Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, “I’m not going to make a blanket criticism of this effort,” arguing that he’d let the courts handle it. Dozens of other congressional Republicans have simply stayed silent. Others, like House Intelligence Chair Devin Nunes, have been supportive. (No Democrats have come out in favor of the order — they’re uniformly opposed.)
And Vice President Mike Pence went from saying this on the campaign trail back in 2015...
Calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional. — Governor Mike Pence (@GovPenceIN) December 8, 2015

As my colleague Jeff Stein points out, no one who’s been paying attention should be surprised by this — “the party has largely fallen in line behind their president ever since the election.”

5918,"HIT & RUN BLOG Federal Judge Stays Trump's Order to Remove Immigrants, Refugees Here Legally""",Reason,1/29/2017,,,http://reason.com/blog/2017/01/28/federal-judge-stays-trumps-order-to-remo,"The American Civil Liberties Union has at least temporarily halted President Donald Trump's attempt to turn away refugees and travelers from a handful of selected Muslim-dominated countries.
As Matt Welch wrote this morning, Trump's order banning travelers and refugees from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen included people who had already been approved to live legally within in the United States and had even been here for years. As a result, immigrants and refugees from these countries who were returning home to the United States were being detained at airports after this order was implemented and were unable to enter the country.
The ACLU quickly sued, representing two Iraqis detained at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. This evening a judge ruled in the ACLU's favor, putting a temporary stay on the president's order.
To be clear, the judge's order specifically covers immigrants and refugees from these countries who have already been approved to travel and live in the United States and only those people. The government cannot simply eject people it has already given green cards and visas to without due process, the ACLU argued. The judge found that argument compelling enough that she concluded that it was likely to win, thus helping convince her to grant the stay.
Read the full three-page ruling here. But the relevant conclusion is right below:
ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero responded:"
4757,Fact-checking Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s immigration speech',Washington Post,9/1/2016,,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/09/01/fact-checking-donald-trumps-immigration-speech/,"“Illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year. And this is what we get. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide 1 million at-risk students with a school voucher.”
Trump states this $113 billion figure as an undisputed fact, but it comes from a report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which seeks to dramatically reduce legal immigration. So you immediately have to look at the numbers with skepticism.
Digging into the numbers, you see that burden on the federal budget is estimated to be just $29 billion, whereas $84 billion is supposedly borne by state and local governments. Why is that? The group counts the cost of educating the children of illegal immigrants, even if they are born in the United States and, thus, are U.S. citizens. “The birth of these children and their subsequent medical care represent a large share of the estimated Medicaid and Child Health Insurance Program expenditures associated with illegal aliens,” the report says.
AD

The report, however, says it tries to account for the taxes collected by federal and local governments from illegal immigrants, but the services used by undocumented immigrants outweigh revenue collections. (Taking into account tax revenues, FAIR says the net cost is about $99 billion.) We should note that because the federal government is currently running a deficit, U.S. citizens also receive more in government benefits than they pay in taxes.
“Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.”
Trump falsely says Clinton’s plan will provide Social Security to illegal immigrants. We awarded this claim Four Pinocchios. In general, people in the United States illegally are not eligible to collect Social Security benefits. They must be granted some type of lawful status — either by obtaining legal status or being granted deferred action.
Even those who are granted deferred action through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) are not granted benefits through the Affordable Care Act. They are, however, eligible for Social Security retirement and Medicare benefits with 10 years of work history, after paying income taxes, and once they reach retirement age.
AD
AD
Clinton supports “comprehensive immigration reform” and has vowed that within her first 100 days in office, she will introduce a plan to overhaul the immigration system with a pathway to full citizenship (which Trump calls “amnesty”). Clinton also supports President Obama’s executive actions on DACA and DAPA. DAPA is pending in court under litigation, and DACA went into effect in 2012.
Clinton does support expanding Obamacare to all families, regardless of immigration status and allowing them to buy into the health exchanges, according to her immigration proposal.
But DACA grantees will not yet reach retirement age if Clinton becomes president and serves two terms in office. DACA grantees must have been under 31 as of June 15, 2012, and meet several other criteria to be eligible. So if Clinton serves two terms and leaves office in 2025, the oldest DACA grantees would be 43.
AD
AD
Trump says her plan would break the federal budget, but the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that the immigration reform component of Clinton’s plan would save the federal budget $100 billion over 10 years.
“This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time.”
Trump has used this number before, but it stems from the unverified assumption that Clinton, who has called for 55,000 additional refugees from Syria, would continue at that pace for every year of her first term, on top of the Obama administration’s proposal for 100,000 refugees for fiscal year 2017. Trump then multiplies 155,000 times four years to reach 620,000 refugees. Clinton has never proposed such a “plan,” so this is an invented figure. Clinton only has proposed an increase of 55,000 refugees for one year.
“We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don’t even know about.”
Trump lauded these two Department of Homeland Security programs, but both have been widely scrutinized and it’s questionable how effective they are.
AD
AD
DHS targeted immigration enforcement to those who committed serious crimes through efforts like Secure Communities, rolled out per county from 2008 through 2012. But a 2014 study showed that increased enforcement didn’t lead to decreased crime, calling into question whether serious crimes were prevalent.
Secure Communities was billed as a crackdown on immigrants who committed serious crimes. But researchers found Secure Communities did not result in a meaningful reduction in the FBI’s overall index crime rate or in rates of violent crimes. There were modest reductions in burglary and motor vehicle theft, not serious crimes like homicides or violent crime.
The program is being phased out, as local agencies are ending or scaling back their participation. Secure Communities was meant to be a complement to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program, through which ICE gave authority to certain state and local law enforcement officers to carry out the functions of federal immigration agents.

The 287(g) program was scrutinized by immigration advocates for diverting local resources to do federal enforcement work, and the potential for racial profiling, without proper federal oversight.
In fact, local law enforcement officers carrying out immigration enforcement under 287(g) authority led to a federal racial profiling case against Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, a Trump surrogate who delivered one of the opening speeches Wednesday night. The Department of Justice found that the sheriff’s office engaged in systemic racial profiling of Latinos. DHS removed the 287(g) authority of Arpaio’s agency, and a federal judge imposed changes.
“It’s always 11 million. Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is.”
Trump says the number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States — which is estimated at 11 million — could be anywhere between 3 million or 30 million. A number of independent organizations researching immigrant flows and the federal government have arrived at the 11 million estimate for the population of undocumented immigrants, using calculations of Census data.

Our friends at PolitiFact and FactCheck.org have found Trump’s 30 million figure to be bogus. A range of experts who study this issue say the margin of error for the 11 million figure may be plus or minus 1 million, but no serious research supports Trump’s claim it could be as high as 30 million.
“For instance, in the last five years, we’ve admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan. And these two countries, according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified.”
Actually, between 2009 and 2014, the United States has admitted 120,000 immigrants from Iraq and 18,000 from Afghanistan, according to Department of Homeland Security statistics. So this is a rare case where Trump lowballs a number. (Oops! In our bleary-eyed state, we counted six years. From 2010 to 2014, the combined figure was about 108,000.)
It goes without saying that the United States has fought two long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In fact, special visa programs were enacted by Congress to expedite the processing of Afghans and Iraqis who worked for the U.S. government.

Trump correctly cites a Pew Research study that surveyed attitudes in various Muslim countries. “In only two countries — Afghanistan (60%) and Iraq (60%) — do majorities say honor killings of women are often or sometimes justified, while only in Afghanistan does a majority (59%) say the same about executing men who have allegedly engaged in pre- or extra-marital sex,” the report said.
President Obama and Hillary Clinton “support visa overstays.”
The Department of Homeland Security has a visa overstay identification process. According to DHS, there were nearly 45 million nonimmigrant visitors in fiscal 2015, with an overstay rate of 1.17 percent, or 525,127 people. That was the first time DHS provided an estimate of foreign visitors who overstayed.
But the Obama administration — and previously, the Bush administration — has been criticized by Congress, law enforcement officials and advocates for failing to fix loopholes in the visa program.
AD
AD
Clinton’s immigration proposal does not address visa overstays. The only mention of visa issues in her proposal is to “fix the family visa backlog,” but it does not offer any specifics. According to the pro-immigrant group National Immigration Forum, there is an administrative backlog of processing visas for spouses, children and parents of U.S. citizens. Clinton has said her “comprehensive immigration reform” proposal with a pathway to citizenship would fix the family visa backlog.
“There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they’ve been ordered to leave the United States. Including large numbers of violent criminals, they won’t take them back.”
Trump is right about this, according to a letter written by Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who in June 2016 urged the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department to stop granting visas to countries that refuse to accept the deportation of their own citizens. The letter said such action has been taken only once, against Ghana in 2001. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) has said he would seek legislation that would sanction countries that refuse to take back their nationals.
The Supreme Court ruled in 2001 that the United States can hold convicted criminals for only six months in detention if a country refuses to accept them. More than 100 immigrants released from detention have later been charged in homicides.
“Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced.”
Trump likes to use anecdotes as evidence for associating violent crimes with illegal immigration, telling stories of victims of homicide by undocumented immigrants. He often talks about the deaths of Jamiel Shaw, Kate Steinle and Sarah Root, all killed by people in the country illegally.
Clearly, stories like this exist. But as we’ve noted numerous times, there are two important data points to remember when Trump talks about this.
First, the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants do not fit Trump’s description of aggravated felons, whose crimes include murder. U.S. Sentencing Commission data shows homicides are a small percentage of the crimes committed by noncitizens, whether they are in the United States illegally or not.
Second, illegal immigration flows across the Southern border in fiscal 2015 were at the lowest levels since 1972, except for in 2011. Earlier this year, there were upticks in border apprehensions of unaccompanied children and their families, compared to 2015. The apprehensions in fiscal 2016 so far have exceeded fiscal 2015, but still indicate an overall decline.
“A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, in our prisons and jails together, had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names.”
The figure is correct, but this is misleading and lacks context. The 2011 Government Accountability Office report Trump cites collected reports from 2003 to 2009 to the Department of Justice’s State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, through which states and localities get reimbursed for convicting and incarcerating inmates of illegal or unknown immigration status (mainly from Mexico).
The study looked at five states (Arizona, California, Florida, New York and Texas) with the largest populations of such inmates. There were 25,064 homicide arrests for this population, but it comprised 1 percent of the 2.9 million arrests they tracked in the study. About 50 percent of the arrests were related to immigration, drugs or traffic violations.
Inmate legal status is not always tracked at local jails and state prisons. This report includes both people who are known to be in the United States illegally, and those who states and local jurisdictions believe are present illegally but whose status can’t be confirmed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

6435,OPINION: Trump immigration speech: A president was born on Wednesday',Guest Writer - Right,9/1/2016,,,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/09/01/trump-immigration-speech-president-was-born-on-wednesday.html,"America, we were introduced to our next president on Wednesday night. He’s not a politician. He is one of a kind. He is an American. Welcome President Donald J. Trump.
I’m a cynical Jewish Ivy Leaguer from New York. Nothing gets me too excited. I don’t believe politicians. Nor do I believe in politicians. I don’t fall for theatrical political productions. I don’t believe rhetoric or propaganda. And I’ve never teared up over a political speech in my life.
Until now. . .
Wednesday night I found myself fist-pumping. I found myself chanting along with the crowd “USA, USA, USA.” And as the procession of mothers and fathers came up to the podium to state the name of their child -- who was murdered by illegal immigrants -- and then say “I’m voting for Trump” or “Trump is our last chance to save America” I found myself tearing up. And the amazing thing is… I couldn't stop. The tears rolled down my face.
This speech in Arizona was the game-changer.
Not just the speech, but the entire day. Trump accepted the invitation to meet with the President of Mexico. He showed he’s a man of action by flying to Mexico on a moment’s notice. Trump stood next to Mexico's president -- looking to all the world like President Donald J. Trump. Trump stated his case and never gave an inch to the president of Mexico. Trump turned a vision -- that was mocked and ripped to shreds for a year now -- into a reality. Who now believes that if Trump is elected a wall won’t be built?
As a conservative, I’ve waited a lifetime for this speech. Why? Because it was a speech that didn’t back down by even one inch. It was a speech aimed at Americans, for Americans, delivered by a proud American, who values American exceptionalism.
It was a speech that restores law and order.
A speech that always put American citizens, workers and taxpayers first.
A speech that recognized the right to safety and security for American citizens.
A speech that recognizes that a foreigner here illegally does not have the same rights as an American-born citizen.
A speech that pointed out that foreigners here illegally should not be treated better than our veterans.
A speech that recognized that American citizens have every right to choose who comes into our country. And that we should proudly choose immigrants with skills, self-sufficiency and a respect for our common values.
It was a speech that recognized that illegal immigrants do not qualify for welfare, food stamps and other entitlements -- and our government has a right, for the first time ever, to prioritize the deportation of illegal foreigners for abusing the welfare system.
It was a speech that recognized that foreigners in American prisons for violent crimes and felonies should and will be deported immediately -- and that no country can refuse to take them back.
It was a speech that recognized our right to practice “extreme vetting” on anyone who wants to come into America -- and that we can choose to exclude those who don’t share or respect our values, customs, laws and Constitution. Some people just won’t be allowed in. (At this point, I jumped up from my chair and screamed “YES!”)
It was also a speech that recognized that the federal government must shut off all funding to Sanctuary cities. After all that's our taxpayer money being given to political leaders who are choosing to break the law. FINALLY, an adult has decided to just say ""NO.""
And then there’s the wall… that great, big, beautiful Trumpian wall. I’ve waited a lifetime to hear that we have a right to build a wall, to protect and secure our borders and keep the bad guys out.
Trump covered it all on Wednesday night. He never backed down to pressure from the corrupt mainstream media, billionaire titans, Wall Street moguls, Silicon Valley tech gurus, lawyers, lobbyists, liberals, the GOP establishment, Ivy League know-it-all intellectuals. He gave no quarter to any of them. He changed nothing to appeal to them.
I could feel their mouths dropping open in disbelief.
Trump is our last chance to save America. To restore law and order. To protect my four beautiful children. To save our economy. To rescue our middle class. We have only one choice. We have only one chance.
Look at yourself in the mirror. If you’re American-born…if you’re a taxpayer…if you’re a parent…if you love America…if you agree this is the greatest country in world history….if you believe we are blessed by God…if you’re horrified at the prospect of bringing hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees into this country at a cost of $400 billion…if you’re scared to death about our soon-to-be-$20 trillion national debt…if you don’t want your child to become just another murder statistic…if any of those descriptions fits you and Trump’s speech didn’t move you…
You suffer from a mental disease called liberalism.
If everything Trump promised and everything I’ve just said doesn’t impress you, then just think of Trump as our TREXIT. Trump is a blunt force, all-American, laser-guided middle finger to everything and everyone in Washington, D.C.
And that, my fellow Americans, sounds like the dream of a lifetime to me."
5245,"Trump's immigration rope-a-dope""",Politico,9/1/2016,,,http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/donald-trump-immigration-address-227616,"2016 Trump's immigration rope-a-dope After diplomatic turn in Mexico, a fiery immigration speech proves the GOP nominee's moderation to be a ruse.
PHOENIX — After playing at diplomacy in Mexico following two weeks of muddled messaging on his signature issue, Donald Trump shed any pretense of a softer message or general election “pivot” with a declaration of his fealty to the hard-line positions and inflammatory rhetoric that propelled him to the Republican nomination.
Trump’s surprising trip to the presidential residence in Mexico City on Wednesday afternoon, which created a moment for him to stand side by side with an elected head of state and declare sovereign nations’ rights to protect their people, amounted to a well-executed bit of campaign stagecraft by the GOP nominee who, after a year of demonizing Mexico and its people, managed to strike a far more diplomatic tone — for him, anyway — on the international stage.

“I happen to have a tremendous feeling for Mexican-Americans,” Trump said, eschewing the usual vitriol as he stood before a dark marble wall that evoked speeches by foreign leaders at the United Nations.
Having ditched his traveling press corps, Trump’s lie that he and President Enrique Peña Nieto didn’t discuss who would pay for his border wall wasn’t exposed until the Mexican president tweeted that they had a few hours later. And minutes after he stepped onto another stage here Wednesday night and began to speak to his raucous supporters, it was even more clear that the sojourn across the southern border, much like his campaign’s two weeks of gentle walkbacks, was a ruse — that Trump and his campaign had used Peña Nieto as a prop in an opening act that served only to set up an evening stemwinder. The farce was, in hindsight, clear even before Trump approached the mic, as two of his warm-up speakers, Rudy Giuliani and Jeff Sessions, donned Trump hats that read “Make Mexico Great Again Also.”
Time after time, the crowd of more than 5,000 people, clad in red Trump hats and waving campaign signs, erupted unprompted into chants of “Build the wall!” and “Lock her up!”
In the Arizona desert, hours after he spoke of his affinity for the Mexican people and the shared priorities of the two neighboring countries, Trump railed for nearly 90 minutes about the many ways undocumented immigrants are hurting the country and harming Americans. He promised not just to build a border wall, but also to empower a massive new “deportation task force” of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to round them up.
“You can call it deported if you want. The press doesn’t like that term,” Trump said. “You can call it whatever the hell you want. They’re gone.”
He reverted to the tough talk he was unable to muster on foreign soil just hours earlier about Mexico paying for the wall. Toward the end of his speech, he used the personal anecdotes of mothers whose children were killed by undocumented immigrants to further demonize “illegals.” He blamed the deaths of “countless Americans” on President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and their immigration policies.
A senior Clinton campaign adviser acknowledged that Trump’s daring Mexico gambit seemed effective and thus worrisome for a few hours Wednesday — until his speech a few hours later. “Not worried anymore,” the adviser said. “The Nuremberg speech put all that statesman-like stuff away.”
Rather than issuing a statement criticizing the speech, Clinton’s campaign sent reporters a collection of tweets praising it — from noted white supremacists like David Duke and conservative provocateur Ann Coulter.
For weeks, Trump had dithered on the issue that has defined his candidacy from the start, suggesting that the question of what to do with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country was more difficult than he’d heretofore suggested as he vowed to send them all home. Kellyanne Conway, his newly hired campaign manager, praised his newfound recognition of the issue’s complexity; and his inner circle of advisers grappled with how to better sell Trump’s tough policies to a general election audience.
Ultimately, however, Trump was seemingly attempting to sell a slightly softened position on deportations to the base that voted for him in the primaries largely because of that stance. Trump’s revived bombast and the 10-pronged list of immigration policy ideas were actually a clumsy effort to obscure the fact that he is no longer vowing to immediately deport every undocumented immigrant in the country illegally (just as many as possible in a more gradual manner starting with 2 million who have criminal records).
“They’re going out fast,” he said. “Moving forward, we will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings, if we even have to do that.
“We will terminate the Obama administration’s deadly, and it is deadly, nonenforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do — crime all over the place. That’s over. That’s over, folks. That’s over.”
But in trying so hard to present his proposals as a hardening of his position, he’s unlikely to accomplish the only real imperative of any policy speech delivered 69 days before an election — winning over unconverted general election voters. And Trump’s amped-up nativism, and his proposal to curb even legal immigration are likely to only harden the two blocs of ardently pro-Trump and never-Trump monoliths on opposite poles of this election.
The irony in Trump’s pre-Labor Day base play is that many of his supporters don’t need harsher rhetoric or unwavering policy positions to turn out for him in November. Many, in fact, don’t take his promises of deporting all undocumented immigrants or forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall all that literally.
“He’s never going to be able to get 11 million people out of the country,” said Steve Hagely, a Trump supporter from ucson standing near the back of the crowd inside the cavernous, concrete-floored convention center. “It’s just something he says.”
While screams and cheers answered Trump’s promise of a border wall, some supporters aren’t convinced that will actually happen either. “How’s he going to really get them to pay for it?” said Brian Howe of Phoenix. “I think what he’s saying is that America’s not going to get taken advantage of anymore.”
Trump spent his speech Wednesday night addressing those already converted to his cause, forgetting how easily most of them will forgive whatever small touches of moderation might creep into an otherwise hawkish policy platform.
“I think he’s just trying to win,” said Drew Hathcock, from Surprise. “The people who are already with him, he’s not going to ever lose them. He’s trying to get more. He needs more. The base isn’t big enough for him to win with just them.”
Unfortunately, Trump's speech appears to be narrowing his support even more, driving away some of the prominent Hispanic Americans who had willingly taken part in the GOP nominee's recent ""roundtables"" that in hindsight seem more like hollow photo ops.
Immediately following the Arizona speech, Jacob Monty, a member of Trump’s newly formed National Hispanic Advisory Council, resigned, and Alfonso Aguilar, president of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, said in an interview that he is “inclined” to pull his support.
“I was a strong supporter of Donald Trump when I believed he was going to address the immigration problem realistically and compassionately,” said Monty, a Houston attorney who has aggressively made the case for Trump. “What I heard today was not realistic and not compassionate.”
Aguilar, president of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, was a one-time Trump critic who earlier this summer set aside his qualms about the New York tycoon’s rhetoric toward Hispanic people, and organized a letter of support signed by himself and other prominent Latino conservatives. Since then, he has repeatedly defended Trump in media appearances, as has Monty.
“It’s so disappointing, because we feel we took a chance, a very risky chance,” Aguilar said. “We decided to make a big U-turn to see if we could make him change. We thought we were moving in the right direction. ... We’re disappointed. We feel misled.”"
3258,"What is Trump's immigration plan -- and when will we see it?""",CNN (Web News),8/29/2016,,,http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/29/politics/trump-immigration-deportation-force/index.html,"Los Angeles (CNN) Donald Trump's lack of clarity on his plans for dealing with some 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country has been so head-spinning in recent weeks it's starting to look deliberate.
Facing headwinds among moderate voters who view his past rhetoric as racist, but trying to assuage his core conservative base, Trump has attempted something of an image makeover during the past two weeks -- leaving Democrats and Republicans alike unclear on where actually Trump stands.
Trump, who promises to deliver a major speech Wednesday on the issue , seems to have narrowed the scope of his immigration plans and changed his tone, suggesting that he is rethinking a policy that was the lynchpin of his appeal during the Republican primaries.
""All the media wants to talk about is the 11 million people,"" Trump complained this weekend during a speech in Iowa, as though that point was a sidebar to immigration policy. ""On day one, I'm going to begin swiftly removing criminal illegal immigrants from this country.""
Trump's comments at Republican Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst's ""Roast and Ride"" were an illustration of the pivot he is attempting --- from his promise during the primaries to deport all undocumented immigrants, to a new narrowed focus on immigrant criminals.
""I promise you from the first day in office -- the first thing I am going to do -- the first piece of paper, the first piece of paper that I'm going to sign is we're going to get rid of these people, day one, before the wall, before anything,"" Trump said in Iowa.
""The reign of terror will be over,"" Trump added, without explaining any of the mechanics of how his policy would work -- namely how he would deal with the enormous backlog in the immigration courts and the legal rights of immigrants who have been accused of a crime.
But a senior campaign adviser said Monday that ""conversation"" on what to do with undocumented immigrations will come after efforts are made to tighten security on the border.
""You shouldn't be having that conversation until years from now,"" the adviser said.
Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, tried to parse the Republican nominee's shifts as evidence that he is working through the issue during an interview Sunday with Jake Tapper on CNN's ""State of the Union."" But he couldn't say what the Republican nominee's current stance is on a deportation force.
""You see a CEO at work. You see someone who is engaging the American people, listening to the American people, hearing from all sides,"" Pence told Tapper, promising that Trump would soon ""articulate a policy"" on the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country.
But there's no certainty that Trump will provide any more clarity on Wednesday -- or that this plan will be the last one he offers. Moreover, the safest course for him politically may be to continue to obfuscate on immigration policy to avoid antagonize either side of the debate.
'Operation Wetback'
Trump rose to the top of the GOP field by stoking the nativist anger of his conservative followers with vows to deport all the undocumented workers in this country, and build a wall between the US and Mexico, before allowing some of ""the good ones"" to return to the US.
JUST WATCHED Two stories - from opposite sides - of 'Operation Wetback' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Two stories - from opposite sides - of 'Operation Wetback' 04:22
Republican rivals scoffed at the sheer unfeasibility of his proposal -- leading Trump to cite the model of the 1954 ""Operation Wetback"" under President Dwight Eisenhower, which rounded up thousands of undocumented immigrants from U.S. fields and ranches, bused them to detention centers, and sent them back to Mexico, first by airlift, and then by cargo boat -- a journey that was widely denounced as inhumane.
Trump cited the Eisenhower model during a notable exchange with Ohio Gov. John Kasich during the fourth Republican debate last fall.
""For the 11 million people, come on, folks,"" Kasich said to Trump. ""We all know you can't pick them up and ship them across, back across the border.. It's a silly argument. It is not an adult argument. It makes no sense.""
""Let me just tell you,"" Trump retorted, ""that Dwight Eisenhower, good president, great president, people liked him.... Moved a 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border.""
""Dwight Eisenhower. You don't get nicer. You don't get friendlier,"" Trump added. ""We have no choice.""
Pivot or no?
Now with less than three months before the election, Trump faces a difficult path to the White House because of his narrow appeal, and his sky-high disapproval ratings among minorities.
Unlike George W. Bush, Mitt Romney and John McCain, his disapproval ratings among minority voter are sky-high. And perhaps his biggest problem is the fact that he continues to underperform among college-educated whites -- in part because many of them find his rhetoric offensive.
Looking to please a broader audience, Trump has shifted his focus to immigrant criminals rather than the majority of the 11 million people living in this country without papers. In an interview with CNN last week, his new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the question of whether he would create a deportation force was ""to be determined.""
Trump signaled his shift in thinking to Fox News' Sean Hannity during a town hall that aired last week by suggesting he might allow some immigrants to stay: ""There's no amnesty, but we would work with them."" He explained that he's been talking to ""thousands and thousands"" of people on this subject.
""I've had very strong people come up to me, really great, great people come up to me, and they've said, 'Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person who's been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and their family out, it's so tough, Mr. Trump,' I have it all the time! It's a very, very hard thing,"" he said during the Hannity event.
Facing pushback from figures on the right like former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin and right-wing commentator Ann Coulter, Trump then backtracked during an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper.
He said there would be no path to legalization for undocumented immigrants unless they leave the country. But he would not answer a question from Cooper about whether he would still attempt to deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country.
""It's a process. You can't take 11 (million) at one time and just say 'boom, you're gone,'"" Trump told Cooper.
Once the initial deportations of undocumented workers who are criminals occur, he said, ""then we can talk."" Of the 11 million deportations, he said, ""there is a very good chance the answer could be yes. We're going to see what happens."""
6570,Trump: \xe2\x80\x98Major speech\xe2\x80\x99 on illegal immigration coming Wednesday in Arizona',Washington Times,8/29/2016,,,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/29/donald-trump-major-speech-illegal-immigration-comi/,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is planning to give a “major speech” on illegal immigration on Wednesday in Arizona, where he’ll get the opportunity to more clearly lay out what his plans will be after a week of mixed messages.
“I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona. Big crowds, looking for a larger venue,” Mr. Trump tweeted Sunday.
The campaign had pushed back a planned speech on the subject in Colorado last Thursday as Mr. Trump got more advice on the subject.
He said last week at a Fox News town hall that there could be a distinction between illegal immigrant criminals and those with longstanding ties to the United States in terms of the deportations that will be prioritized.
“There certainly can be a softening, because we’re not looking to hurt people … but we’re going to follow the laws of this country,” Mr. Trump said.
“There’s no amnesty, but we work with them,” he said.
Mr. Trump has since said there will be no path to legalization for illegal immigrants who remain in the country.
“I don’t think it’s a softening,” he told CNN. “I’ve had people say it’s a hardening, actually.”
Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on “Fox News Sunday” that the “softening” is “more approach than policy.”
“If you enforce the law and you deal with those agencies that already exist to enforce the law, then we’ll see what we’ve got,” Ms. Conway said.
“The signature piece of his legislation has, and his campaign, has always been build the wall. That has not changed,” she said. “Build the wall. No amnesty. No citizenship. No more sanctuary cities.”

4631,Trump Goes Back To Original Immigration Position With Second 180 Flip',HuffPost,8/28/2016,,,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-immigration-flip-iowa_us_57c21d25e4b085c1ff29b41f,"DES MOINES, Iowa – Donald Trump’s experiment with “softening” his immigration policy came to a dramatic end Saturday in a fairgrounds livestock pavilion, with the Republican presidential nominee promising deportations within an hour of his inauguration.
“We are going to rid of the criminals, and it’s going to happen within one hour after I take office,” he said. “We will move justly, but we will move fast. Believe me.”
Trump has made the forcible deportation of the 11 million people in the country without documentation a cornerstone of his presidential campaign from its start last year. It made him a favorite among a segment of the Republican base, and helped him win the nomination over a dozen Republican senators and governors.
Then, last week, Trump explained in an appearance on Fox News that “thousands and thousands” of people he had met with on the issue had urged him not to deport undocumented immigrants who have been in the country for years and have no criminal record, but rather stable jobs and families. That new tack brought an immediate backlash from some of his hardcore supporters – including author Ann Coulter – for breaking his promise, as well as “I told you so” claims from mainstream GOP critics who had long predicted his eventual flip.
Trump backtracked on his new position later in the week – including in a CNN interview, where he claimed the modification was not a “softening” but actually “a hardening.” The Saturday remarks appear to complete the process, with Trump suggesting that undocumented immigrants commit a significant percentage of the country’s crimes and making zero mention of finding some way for those who have not committed any crimes to stay.
He also asserted – without any supporting evidence – that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would, if she were to win, end “all routine immigration enforcement.”
“In other words, totally open borders. Which will lead to a massive crime wave,” Trump said.
Carlo Allegri / Reuters Trump said that if elected, he would ""begin swiftly removing"" the ""hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants"" who are in the country.
“I think he was trying to make up for his missteps,” said Brian Zegers, a 48-year-old personnel consultant who attended the biker-themed event in a leather vest and bandana. Smiling, Zegers attributed Trump’s original reversal to the advice of consultants and said the reversal of the reversal was just what the boisterous crowd of Trump supporters wanted to hear.
Other, more committed Trump fans said his shifts in position were of no concern to them. “The message will get tightened up before the election,” said Jim De Kruif, 57 an investment adviser who has always assumed that Trump will modify his policies heading into the general election. “That’s what politicians do.”
Trump also continued his recent practice of pledging to work for African-Americans and Latinos in front of virtually all-white audiences. He spent about five minutes of his 50-minute speech promising lower taxes for family farms and offering a commitment to the corn-based ethanol mandate in gasoline for his Iowa audience, and then spent twice as long telling members of the two ethnic minorities that the Democratic Party had not helped them and that they should support Trump. “What do you have to lose?” he asked, repeating a new favorite line.
Saturday’s event was organized by Iowa’s freshman Sen. Joni Ernst, the second of what she is hopes will become an annual ritual: a motorcycle rally raising money for a veterans’ charity, followed by a GOP pep rally.
Trump, though, did not participate in the motorcycle ride from the local Harley Davidson dealership to the Iowa State Fairgrounds. Instead, as is his preference, he flew in specifically for the event aboard his personal airliner, delivering the final speech of the afternoon to the crowd of about 2,000.
Ernst and other Iowa elected officials preceded Trump on stage. While urging voters to support Trump, the leaders spent little time praising their presidential nominee, and mainly pointed out the importance of keeping Supreme Court nominations out of Clinton’s hands.
Even that approach, though, could not entirely insulate the hometown Republicans from the danger of such a volatile candidate at the top of their ticket. At a news conference to explain the benefits of the ride for a veteran’s charity, Ernst was confronted with a question about one of the latest controversies for Trump’s campaign: reports of CEO Steve Bannon’s domestic violence charge from his first marriage.
Ernst pointed out that it was not her job to vet Trump’s staff. “I am not making the hiring decisions,” she said, but then quickly added: “Sexual assault and domestic violence is never OK – is never OK.”"
5929,GOP VP nominee Mike Pence: \xe2\x80\x98Nothing has changed\xe2\x80\x99 in Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s illegal immigration agenda',Washington Times,8/28/2016,,,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/28/mike-pence-gop-vp-nominee-nothing-has-changed-in-d/,"Republican vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence said Sunday that nothing has changed about Donald Trump’s position on illegal immigration, as the campaign moved to tamp down criticism that the presidential nominee is flip-flopping on the signature issue of his run.
“Let’s be very clear: Nothing has changed about Donald Trump’s position on dealing with illegal immigration,” the Indiana governor said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
Mr. Trump has encountered criticism form his conservative base after saying he is “softening” his position on illegal immigration, a move that coincided with increased efforts to woo Hispanic voters.
Mr. Pence said that Mr. Trump had remained consistent on his pledge to build a wall on the United State’s southern border, crack down on illegal immigrants finding work in the U.S. and create a “mechanism” for dealing with the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the country.
He stressed that the mechanism would be “humane,” a word Mr. Trump repeatedly has used.
“You heard the word humanely again,” said Mr. Pence. “It’s going to be fair. It’s going to be tough. There will be no path to legalization, no path to citizenship unless people leave the country.”
Earlier in the campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to deport all illegal immigrants and establish a deportation force to do the job. But he had dropped that rhetoric from his stump speech months ago.

2514,Trump Has A Completely Different Immigration Position Every Day',HuffPost,8/25/2016,,,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-immigration_us_57be3296e4b02673444e5b0f,"GOP nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday presented a plan for granting undocumented immigrants legal status, the latest turn in his ever-evolving stance on immigration.
Trump, in a town hall taped Tuesday with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, said undocumented immigrants could pay back-taxes to gain legal status. But he emphasized there would be “no citizenship.”
“They’ll pay back-taxes, they have to pay taxes, there’s no amnesty, as such, there’s no amnesty, but we work with them,” Trump said.
Trump claimed that his supporters have urged him to soften his stance on immigration, even though he has staked much of his campaign on his tough stance on immigration and portraying immigrants as “rapists and criminals.”
“When I go through and meet thousands and thousands of people on this subject, and they’ve said, ‘Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person who’s been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and their family out, it’s so tough, Mr. Trump,’” he told Hannity. “I have it all the time! It’s a very, very hard thing.”
The GOP nominee’s remarks are the latest development in a week dominated by speculation that he is moderating his position on immigration. It began over the weekend, when he met with Hispanic leaders and told them that he was open to legalization for undocumented immigrants.
It’s difficult to square these new remarks with the Trump who, throughout the GOP primaries, called for “rounding up” and deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants and their families.
“They’re gonna have to go out,” he said at a debate in November. “We have no choice if we’re going to run our country properly.”
Yet his new proposal resembles the positions of several of his primary opponents — whom he frequently criticized for being too soft on immigration.

The continual problem with understanding Trump’s position on immigration ― or any of his policies, for that matter ― is how often he contradicts himself and how vaguely he speaks about it.
For most of his campaign thus far, his immigration plan has boiled down to building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and “rounding up” all undocumented immigrants.
Only recently have he and his campaign even begun to specify what a Trump immigration plan might look like. On Tuesday, a Trump aide told The Huffington Post that the GOP nominee never meant mass deportations but instead wants to enforce existing immigration laws and focus on getting rid of undocumented immigrants with criminal backgrounds.
Trump again referred to this group in his town hall with Hannity, calling them “the bad ones.”
But while he and his campaign have signaled a “softening” on immigration, they have also denied it and left it open to interpretation. Because of this, and his penchant to change his mind, it’s hard to take this latest shift at face value.

Trump's apparent suggestion is not too dissimilar from positions offered by other Republicans
Washington (CNN) Donald Trump suggested Wednesday that he would allow exceptions to let some undocumented immigrants to stay in the US, vowing he wouldn't grant them citizenship but telling Fox News, ""there's no amnesty, but we work with them.""
For Trump, whose rise to the Republican nomination was based in large part on his hardline immigration policies, the comments are the clearest sign yet that he is reconsidering his pledge to deport all of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US, a key part of his campaign platform.
""No citizenship. Let me go a step further -- they'll pay back-taxes, they have to pay taxes, there's no amnesty, as such, there's no amnesty, but we work with them,"" Trump told Sean Hannity when asked if he would allow for exceptions to his long-held position.
He continued: ""Now, everybody agrees we get the bad ones out. But when I go through and I meet thousands and thousands of people on this subject -- and I've had very strong people come up to me, really great, great people come up to me -- and they've said, 'Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person who's been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and their family out, it's so tough, Mr. Trump,' I have it all the time.

His remarks were the latest in a series of recent interviews where he has said he is considering softening a previous pledge made at the onset of his campaign to deport 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. During a “Hannity” town hall on Tuesday, Trump said he was open to “softening” laws dealing with illegal immigrants.
On Wednesday, Trump told Hannity there would be ""no citizenship"" for those illegal immigrants.
""Let me go a step further- they'll pay back-taxes, they have to pay taxes, there's no amnesty, as such, there's no amnesty, but we work with them,"" Trump said.

The Republican nominee then returned to one of his tougher stances by slamming sanctuary cities for ""protecting criminals,"" where he claimed police are at the point ""where they almost give up.""
""It's so hard for the police to--if somebody is protected between the sanctuary city nonsense,"" Trump said. ""We got to get rid of the sanctuary cities, we're protecting these people.

Why it’s so hard for Trump to retreat on immigration
Since launching his presidential candidacy 14 months ago, Donald Trump’s most consistent and uncompromising policy issue has been immigration. Indeed, it was the subject of his first general-election TV ad that started airing on Friday. Yet over the weekend, his top aides and advisers suggested that Trump might be shifting on his past position that all of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States must be deported forcibly. “To be determined,” is what newly minted Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway said on CNN when asked if Trump was retreating on the “deportation force” he talked about during the primary season. But here’s why it’s so hard -- if not impossible -- for Trump to retreat on immigration: He’s caught between his clear, unambiguous past statements and a base that might not willing to see him moderate on the issue. His past statements:
Aug. 16, 2015""We're going to keep the families together, but they have to go,"" Trump said on NBC’s Meet the Press.” More Trump: ""We will work with them. They have to go. Chuck, we either have a country, or we don't have a country,"" he said.
Nov. 11, 2015“You are going to have a deportation force, and you are going to do it humanely,” Trump said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” when asked how he would round up the nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants.
April 21, 2016“Look, we’re either going to have a country or we’re not going to have a country. But many people are very fine people. And I’m sure these are very, very fine people. They’re going to go, and we’re going to create a path where we can get them into this country legally, okay? But it has to be done legally” -- when asked by a questioner at a “Today” town hall that person’s undocumented relatives would have to be deported if Trump becomes president.
Trump can’t ignore a base that has cheered his uncompromising immigration position
And then there are the Trump supporters who’ve cheered the GOP presidential nominee for being so uncompromising on immigration. The Washington Post’s Dave Weigel: “Jared Taylor hits play, and the first Donald Trump ad of the general election unfolds across his breakfast table. Syrian refugees streaming across a border. Hordes of immigrants, crowded onto trains. ‘Donald Trump’s America is secure,’ rumbles a narrator. ‘Terrorists and dangerous criminals kept out. The border, secure; our families, safe.’ Taylor, one of America’s foremost “racialists,” is impressed and relieved. ‘That’s a powerful appeal,’ he said. ‘If he can just stick to that, he is in very good shape.’ From his Fairfax County home, Taylor has edited the white nationalist magazine American Renaissance and organized racialist conferences under the ‘AmRen’ banner. He said that Trump should ‘concentrate on his natural constituency, which is white people,’ suggesting that winning 65 percent of the white vote would overwhelm any Democratic gains with minorities. When Trump made Breitbart News CEO Steve Bannon his campaign’s chief executive last week, Taylor found reasons to celebrate. It was the latest sign for white nationalists, once dismissed as fringe, that their worldview was gaining popularity and that the old Republican Party was coming to an end.”
Clinton camp: This is more about wooing Republicans and swing voters than Latinos and African Americans
Team Clinton believes that this Trump campaign talk about a possible retreat on immigration -- as well as Trump’s recent appeals to African-American voters -- is aimed more at nervous Republicans and swing voters more than Latinos and African Americans. Their argument: If this were an actual play for these minority voters, the Trump campaign would be reaching out directly to these audiences and not airing a new ad on immigration. Most importantly, we’ve yet to hear directly from Trump on any immigration change. And until we do, all of this is talk rather than any kind of policy change. As National Journal’s Ben Pershing observes:

Trump blurts something out on TV Media analyzes strategic ""shift"" There is no ""shift"" (and therefore no strategy).
Trump camp pounces on Clinton Foundation announcement
Meanwhile, the Trump campaign is pouncing on the Clinton Foundation’s announcement last week that it won’t accept foreign or corporate donations if Hillary Clinton becomes president. “The Clinton Foundation is the most corrupt enterprise in political history, and it's clear that Hillary Clinton and her campaign have no idea how to defend it,” a Trump official tells NBC News. “Their refusal to cease foreign and corporate donations only highlights the fact her acceptance of such donations while Secretary of State were a conflict of interest and highly unethical. Until then, the drumbeat to release her FBI testimony and open the books on this shady operation will only intensify.” Indeed, as the New York Times writes, “[W]hile the move could avoid the awkwardness of Mr. Clinton jetting around the world asking for money while his wife is president, it did not resolve a more pressing question: how her administration would handle longtime donors seeking help from the United States, or whose interests might conflict with the country’s own.”
Colin Powell: Clinton people are trying to pin email scandal on me
Maybe we now know why Colin Powell hasn’t endorsed Hillary Clinton yet. People magazine: “On Friday, the New York Times reported that Clinton told FBI officials former Secretary of State Colin Powell had advised her to use a personal email account while she held the Secretary of State office herself. ‘Her people have been trying to pin it on me,’ Powell, 79, told PEOPLE Saturday night at the Apollo in the Hamptons 2016 Night of Legends fête in East Hampton, New York. ‘The truth is, she was using [the private email server] for a year before I sent her a memo telling her what I did,’ Powell added. Why does the former diplomat believe this to be the case? ‘Why do you think?’ he said. ‘It doesn't bother me. But it's okay; I'm free.’”
Clinton camp unveils new TV ad hitting Trump on the commander-in-chief test
The Clinton camp is up with a new TV ad hitting Trump on the commander-in-chief test. “All it takes is one wrong move,” the narrator says after the ad plays clips of Trump saying “And you can tell them to go f%@& themselves” and “I would bomb the sh!% out of them.”
It’s official: Clinton camp outraises Trump in July, has $20 million more in the bank
Over the weekend, we received the official fundraising numbers from July. Here’s the apples-to-apples comparisons, per NBC’s Leigh Ann Caldwell:
Clinton campaign raised in July: $52.3 million
Trump campaign raised in July: $36.6 million
Clinton campaign cash on hand as of July 31: $58.5 million
Trump campaign cash on hand as of July 31: $38.4 million
DNC raised in July: $32.3 million
RNC raised in July: $27.2 million
Total Clinton/DNC raised in July: $84.6 million
Total Trump/RNC raised in July: $63.8 million
Caldwell also writes this story: “With fewer than 80 days until election day, Republican kingmaker Sheldon Adelson still hasn't put any money toward Donald Trump's campaign for president, according to newly released filings from the Federal Election Commission. The snub from Las Vegas casino magnate, who is one of the GOP's largest donors, is another example of the concerns some members of the Republican Party still have with their presidential nominee.”
A market-by-comparison of the Clinton-vs.-Trump TV ad war
Finally, here is the market-by-market comparison of the amount of money Trump has on the air in the four states where he’s now advertising versus the Clinton campaign in these same four states from Aug. 19-29. (The Clinton campaign also is advertising in Iowa, Nevada, and New Hampshire, where the Trump camp isn’t.)

Is Donald Trump considering wavering on a key campaign promise?
That's what several news reports published over the weekend suggest. And while the Trump campaign issued a statement denying any shift on immigration policy, top surrogates and campaign operatives hinted that a change just might be on its way.
You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely.
The issue: what to do with the estimated 11 million immigrants already living in the United States illegally.
Since he entered the presidential race last year, Trump insisted they would have to be expelled from the country, despite the logistical and humanitarian questions a mass deportation would present.
""You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely,"" he told MSNBC in November 2015.
But this weekend, Buzzfeed reported that during a meeting with a Hispanic advisory council, Trump hinted he wasn't totally attached to that proposal. People who attended the meeting told the website that Trump asked for suggestions on a ""humane and efficient"" way to address people already living in the country illegally. Other news outlets confirmed the conversations.
Univision went one step further, reporting that Trump will roll out a new immigration plan Thursday in Colorado ""that will include finding a way to legalize millions of undocumented immigrants.""
That's something the campaign immediately pushed back on. ""Mr. Trump said nothing today that he hasn't said many times before, including in his convention speech,"" said Trump campaign staffer Steven Cheung in a statement provided to NPR.
And yet, when asked on CNN the next day whether Trump's immigration policies would include that promised ""deportation force,"" Trump's new campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, responded, ""To be determined.""
On CBS News' Face the Nation, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions said Trump is ""wrestling with how to do that,"" referring to removing people in the country illegally.
""He did not make a firm commitment yesterday or at the meeting the other day about what he will do with that,"" Sessions said. ""But he did listen, and he's talking about it.""

A major shift on immigration policy would be the clearest signal yet that, faced with widening deficits in most national and state-level polls, the Trump campaign is now making a concerted effort to appeal to moderate and independent voters.
But a shift would carry major political risks, too. Immigration is a key issue — if not the key issue — for many of Trump's fiercest supporters. And it's been a hallmark of Trump's campaign since day one, when he warned that people entering the country from Mexico were ""bringing drugs; they're bringing crime; they're rapists.""
Trump has also framed himself as a no-apologies ""truth"" teller, who will push for what he thinks is best regardless of the political consequences. Walking back from a high-profile promise could undermine that image.
Trump's campaign never provided details about what that deportation force would look like or how it would track down and expel people in the country illegally. But Trump stuck to the promise.
""We have no choice if we're going to run our country properly and if we're going to be a country,"" he said in a December debate.
Ohio Gov. John Kasich questioned Trump's proposal during that forum, saying, ""Come on, folks. We all know you can't pick them up and ship them across — back across the border. It's a silly argument. It's not an adult argument. It makes no sense.""
Trump responded by citing a controversial Eisenhower administration initiative called ""Operation Wetback,"" which deported up to 1.5 million immigrants who were living in the United States illegally.
Trump's response to terrorism has centered on immigration as well. After the mass shootings at Orlando's Pulse nightclub in June, Trump reiterated his call for a temporary ban on all Muslims immigrating to the United States. That's despite the fact that the shooter was born in New York City.
""The only reason the killer was in America in the first place is because we allowed his family to come here,"" Trump said in his first speech after the attacks. ""That is a fact — and a fact we need to talk about.""
At nearly every campaign rally, supporters chant ""Build that wall! Build that wall!"" referencing Trump's promise to erect a wall along the entirety of the United States-Mexico border.
""We will build a wall, don't you worry,"" Trump assured the crowd Friday evening at a Michigan rally."
2959,Trump: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not flip-flopping\xe2\x80\x99 on immigration',Washington Times,8/22/2016,,,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/22/donald-trump-im-not-flip-flopping-immigration/,"GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump said Monday he’s not “flip-flopping” on immigration, calling for a “fair but firm” answer and saying that “we have to be very, very strong” when people enter the country illegally.
“No, I’m not flip-flopping — we want to come up with a really fair but firm answer. It has to be very firm,” he said on “Fox and Friends.” “But we want to come up with something fair.”
Mr. Trump, who has made building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and mass deportations of illegal immigrants cornerstones of his campaign, met with members of a National Hispanic Advisory Council over the weekend.
“These were great people. These are highly respected people within the community — unbelievable people,” Mr. Trump said.
“We’re dealing with people. We have to be very firm; we have to be very, very strong when people come in illegally,” he said.
“We have a lot of people that want to come in through the legal process. It’s not fair for them, and we’re working with a lot of people in the Hispanic community to try and come up with an answer,” Mr. Trump said.
Asked if Mr. Trump’s immigration plans include a “deportation force,” which he previously mentioned, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on CNN Sunday that’s “to be determined.”

5615,Supreme Court Deadlocks on Obama Immigration Plan.',New York Times (Online News),6/23/2016,,,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/us/supreme-court-immigration-obama-dapa.html,"The case hinged in part on whether Texas had suffered the sort of direct and concrete injury that gave it standing to sue. Texas said it had standing because it would be costly for the state to give driver’s licenses to immigrants affected by the federal policy.
Chief Justice Roberts is often skeptical of expansive standing arguments. But it seemed plain when the case was argued in April that he was satisfied that Texas had standing, paving the way for a deadlock.
Mr. Obama said the White House did not believe the terse ruling from the court had any effect on the president’s authority to act unilaterally. But he said the practical effect would be to freeze his efforts on behalf of immigrants until after the November election.
He also predicted that lawmakers would eventually act to overhaul the nation’s immigration system.
“Congress is not going to be able to ignore America forever,” he said. “It’s not a matter of if; it’s a matter of when. We get these spasms of politics around immigration and fear-mongering, and then our traditions and our history and our better impulses kick in.”
White House officials had repeatedly argued that presidents in both parties had used similar executive authority in applying the nation’s immigration laws. And they said Congress had granted federal law enforcement wide discretion over how those laws should be carried out.
But the court’s ruling may mean that the next president will again need to seek a congressional compromise to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws. And it left immigration activists deeply disappointed."
5540,"Supreme Court deadlocks, dooming Obama deportation amnesty'",Washington Times,6/23/2016,,,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jun/23/supreme-court-blocks-obama-immigration-plan/,"President Obama lost his bid to kick-start his deportation amnesty Thursday after the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4, keeping in place a lower court’s injunction, nixing the policy for the rest of Mr. Obama’s tenure and igniting political and legal debates that will carry on well beyond.
Mr. Obama said the ruling “takes us further from the country we aspire to be,” and vowed to protect most illegal immigrants from deportation anyway, saying his discretionary powers remain intact.
But the decision is a devastating blow to his hopes of a legacy-building amnesty, known by the acronym DAPA, that would have granted as many as 5 million illegal immigrants a stay of deportation and the keys to a more normal life in the U.S.: work permits and Social Security numbers enabling them to obtain driver’s licenses and other taxpayer benefits.
The ruling could have been even worse. Had Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February, still been on the court, Mr. Obama would likely have lost in a 5-4 decision that could have spanked him on broad constitutional grounds and imposed limits on future presidents, analysts said.
Instead, the tie decision leaves in place rulings by a district judge in Texas and by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Mr. Obama broke the law when he claimed he had the categorical power to grant “deferred action” to nearly half of the illegal immigrants in the country.
Republicans hailed it as a blow to Mr. Obama’s expansive claims of power, saying the court restored some of the balance that the country’s founders envisioned in the Constitution.
“The Supreme Court’s ruling makes the president’s executive action on immigration null and void. The Constitution is clear: The president is not permitted to write laws — only Congress is. This is another major victory in our fight to restore the separation of powers,” said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who is leading a similar lawsuit against Obamacare.
Mr. Obama was not cowed. He said the justices never reached the big issues of the case, so it doesn’t affect any of his other policies, such as global warming and Obamacare.
He said he will abide by the ruling, effectively ending his plans for the DAPA program. But he said most of those who would have qualified still won’t be deported because they are likely to have ties to the community and relatively clean criminal records.
“They will remain low priorities for deportation,” he said.
Hispanic rights groups vowed to make Republicans pay at the ballot box in November. They said the clearest way for illegal immigrants to gain legal status is to elect lawmakers who support a path to citizenship.
“This act of cruelty delivered on immigrants by the Republican Party will serve as another watershed moment in the complete collapse of Latino and immigrant support for the GOP and its candidates,” said Kica Matos, director of immigrant rights at the Center for Community Change Action. “Our movement gets stronger when faced with anti-immigrant attacks. We expect the decision to be another factor in record Latino and pro-immigrant voter turnout in 2016.”
Justices didn’t release an opinion in the deadlock, and they don’t say who voted on which side of the question — though based on oral arguments, it’s fairly certain the four justices appointed by Democratic presidents sided with the administration and the Republican-appointed justices sided with Texas.
Texas argued that the program forced it to issue driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants and to pay for education and health care benefits that the illegal immigrants would also be entitled to under DAPA.
They said the DAPA program broke federal procedural law because it was a major policy change never put out for public comment, that it broke immigration law by granting legal status to too many people and that it violated the president’s constitutional limits on power.
U.S. District Judge Andrew S. Hanen sided with Texas on the procedural law question, and then the 5th Circuit sided with Texas on the immigration law challenge. Neither court reached the bigger constitutional questions.
Legally, the ruling leaves a number of unanswered questions.
The lower courts’ injunction applies nationwide, but some states have challenged that, saying that it should apply only in Texas and the 25 other states that sued to halt the amnesty. If they are successful in getting the injunction narrowed, it could leave a confusing patchwork, with illegal immigrants in some states eligible for amnesty and those in other states denied it.
It’s also unclear how much more Mr. Obama can push his nondeportation policies. But he took any further action off the table.
“I don’t anticipate that there are additional executive actions,” he said.
He had said words to that effect before, however, and then reversed himself. Indeed, in the years before his 2014 announcement of the DAPA program, he repeatedly said he didn’t have the power to grant such a broad amnesty because such a claim would make him a “king,” not a president.
He began to change his mind after Congress deadlocked on legislation to grant the chance at full citizenship rights to most illegal immigrants.
In November 2014, after massive defeats for Democrats in the midterm congressional elections, Mr. Obama announced he had been mistaken and that he did, in fact, possess broad powers to grant tentative legal status to illegal immigrants. His legal advisers said he could use “deferred action” on anyone who had a speculative path to legal status — in this case, millions of immigrants with children in the U.S. legally.
On Thursday, Mr. Obama said the court’s ruling squanders a chance to “bring rationality” to the immigration system. He said it’s now up to voters to impose their will, and they need to use November’s elections to send a message.
“Now we’ve got a choice about who we’re going to be as a country, what we’re going to teach our kids and how we want to be represented in Congress and the White House,” he said.
Mr. Obama’s 2012 amnesty, which applies to a much smaller group of Dreamers, or young adult illegal immigrants, remains in place. It was not part of the legal challenge.
The ruling also does not affect other parts of Mr. Obama’s 2014 executive actions, which included streamlining the citizenship process, giving more leeway to local police to refuse to cooperate with federal authorities and opening more slots for temporary workers.
Homeland Security officials are also working on a policy of expanding “hardship” waivers, which would allow illegal immigrants to remain in the U.S. to care for family members.

4130,Supreme Court blocks Obama immigration actions',The Hill,6/23/2016,,,http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/president-obama-immigration-actions-programs-blocked-supreme-court-deadlocked-scalia-dapa-daca-crushing-blow,"The Supreme Court dealt a critical blow to President Obama's immigration policies on Thursday, deadlocking in a 4-4 decision over two controversial programs the White House wants to implement.
The tied vote leaves in place a lower court ruling that blocks a program allowing undocumented immigrants who are parents of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents to remain in the United States for three years and apply for work permits.
It also prevents the administration from otherwise expanding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program issued by Obama in 2012.

This is the most prominent Supreme Court case to stall in a 4-4 tie, and it raises the stakes further in this fall's presidential election.
After Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, Obama nominated federal Judge Merrick Garland to the court.
But Senate Republicans, even before that nomination, said they would not hold a vote or a hearing for anyone nominated by Obama, arguing the pivotal vote on the high court should be determined by the next president.
The White House and Democrats in Congress have howled in rage over that move, and Thursday's decision will increase tensions over the Senate blockade.
Obama in an appearance from the White House press briefing room decried what he called the ""lack"" of a decision by the eight-justice court.
“The fact the Supreme Court wasn’t able to issue a decision today doesn’t just set the system back even further, it takes us further back from the country we want to be,"" he said.

""This 4-4 decision is clear evidence we need nine justices on the court,"" Durbin said.

This is another major victory in our fight to restore the separation of powers.”
Thursday's action does not affect the original DACA decision by Obama that allows certain children who entered or stayed in the United States illegally to remain in the country and apply for work permits.
Twenty-six Republican-led states sued the federal government over the expansion of that program, as well as the new program for parents, after the president issued fresh executive actions in November 2014.
The states claimed they would be burdened by having to spend more on public services like healthcare, law enforcement and education if undocumented parents of both American citizens and legal permanent residents were allowed to stay in the country.
Texas, specifically, said it would be hurt by having to issue more driver's licenses, a benefit that’s now subsidized.
Supporters of the administration argued that Texas could pass the added costs for driver’s licenses on to residents. They claim the challenging states actually stand to make money off Obama’s programs from an increase in tax contributions.
A three-judge panel from a federal appeals court in New Orleans said in a split decision the Obama administration lacked the legal power to shield more than 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation and grant them work permits.
It handed a nationwide injunction preventing the administration from putting the programs into place.
By failing to provide a new ruling on that decision, the Supreme Court's action on Thursday leaves it in place.
The actual lawsuit suit filed by the 26 states is still working its way through the court system.
When Obama took the action to expand his immigration programs, it was part of a last-ditch effort to take action after Congress failed to pass a sweeping overhaul of nation’s immigration system that would have offered a path to citizenship for millions of people living in the country illegally.
Immigrant rights activists derided Obama as the “deporter in chief” for ramping up the pace of deportations during his first term. Since then, he’s taken steps to narrow the focus of immigration enforcement, and his executive actions were seen as a centerpiece of his push to reverse that trend.

3352,Obama amnesty Supreme Court case to test limits of presidential power',Washington Times,4/18/2016,,,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/17/obama-amnesty-supreme-court-case-to-test-limits-of/,"The Constitution was ratified more than two centuries ago, and in all that time no president had ever tested the limits of executive power enough to force the Supreme Court to rule whether he has lived up to the founders’ command that the laws be “faithfully executed.”
Until now.
When the justices convene Monday morning, they will hear what is shaping up to be the biggest case of the term, and perhaps one of the most consequential in a generation, as they consider whether President Obama has overstepped his constitutional powers by trying to grant a tentative deportation amnesty to up to 5 million illegal immigrants.
“In 225 years, the Supreme Court has never had occasion to ask the president whether he has reneged on his oath to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. However, with pens and phones replacing checks and balances, the Supreme Court is now poised to break new constitutional ground in order to preserve our embattled separation of powers,” said Josh Blackman, associate professor at the South Texas College of Law, who has followed the case from the start and filed amicus briefs opposing Mr. Obama’s claim of powers.
At issue is the Take Care Clause, which is what scholars call the Constitution’s charge to presidents to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.”
That clause has been read to be both empowering to presidents, emboldening them with independent authority to see through the execution of laws, but also as a check — that, in the end, he carry out laws rather than write them.
For many, Mr. Obama’s deportation amnesty for illegal immigrants, announced in November 2014, strays too far into lawmaking.
At that time, Mr. Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson announced a policy of granting nearly half of the 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. a proactive stay of deportation, along with the promise of work permits, entitling them to driver’s licenses, Social Security numbers and some taxpayer benefits.
Texas led 25 other states in suing, arguing that they suffered economic harm from the amnesty and that it would likely lead to even more illegal immigrants. The states said Mr. Obama broke administrative law and immigration law, and violated the Constitution.
Lower courts sided with the states and halted the amnesty on statutory grounds, and never reached the constitutional questions. But the justices, in what Mr. Blackman said was a first, asked both sides to also file briefs on the Take Care Clause.
Immigrant rights advocates say the case should be easy for the justices, pointing to smaller actions taken by Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush that they say paved the way for Mr. Obama. Those advocates say immigration legislation passed by Congress appear to approve of the “deferred action” power Mr. Obama used to halt deportations and grant work permits.
If Congress granted the president that kind of broad authority, then it’s legal and constitutional, said Brianne J. Gorod, chief counsel at the Constitutional Accountability Center.
“If the court concludes, as I think it will and should, that these executive actions are consistent with the laws passed by Congress, then it necessarily follows that they are consistent with the Constitution,” she said.
But John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said Mr. Obama’s intention in this instance wasn’t to carry out the law, but rather to undermine it by halting deportations — and granting a future get-out-of-jail card.
“The president gets to make the policy decisions about how the law is enforced. But he can’t take it all the way to say I’m not going to enforce it at all, and I think that’s where the line is crossed,” said Mr. Yoo, who served in the Bush administration and helped explore the limits of presidential war powers.
Mr. Obama has complicated his case by his own words. Before his 2014 announcement, he repeatedly and forcefully denied having the power to use deferred action so broadly. But after Congress refused to act on his immigration proposals, he reversed himself and claimed he did, after all, have the power.
Then just days after he announced the policy, he told an audience he “took an action to change the law” — a power that is supposed to be reserved for Congress.
Lower courts noted both of those statements in ruling against Mr. Obama, but Mr. Yoo said they are not likely to have much effect on the justices. He said it’s similar to how Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. didn’t give much credence during the Obamacare case to the president’s initial claim that the health care law wasn’t a tax.
Indeed, the justices eventually ruled that the reason Obamacare was constitutional is because it was a tax, no matter what Mr. Obama told voters.
Legal analysts said the case could decide the limits of presidential powers for years to come. Mr. Yoo said if the justices side with Mr. Obama, it opens the way for a future Republican president to use prosecutorial discretion to stop enforcing tax laws.
He also said Mr. Obama’s expansive interpretation of carrying out laws could frighten Congress away from dealing with the White House.
“He’s actually damaging the presidency for the future, because if you’re Congress in the future, and you’re working out some deal with the president, you can’t trust any deal you make with the president again,” he said.
A ruling is expected from the justices by the end of June.
But with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the eight-member court could deadlock 4-4. That would leave the appeals court’s decision in place, which would be a victory for Mr. Obama’s opponents.
A tie ruling, though, would also mean the court wouldn’t issue a definitive statement on Mr. Obama’s claims of power. That would leave for a future court the question of just how far a president can go to shape or, as Mr. Obama said, to “change” the law unilaterally.
Ms. Gorod said the justices may not even reach the big issues in the case. She said there is a good chance they throw out Texas’ challenge altogether, ruling that the state can’t show it’s has been harmed by the president’s action.
She said Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy were skeptical of similar claims in other cases.
Hispanic rights groups say the issue is already baked into the November elections no matter what the justices do and that voters are prepared to reward Democrats for backing Mr. Obama and punish Republicans for opposing him.
By a 5-1 margin, Hispanic voters say they are less likely to vote for a candidate who fought the amnesty. They also said they increasingly see Republicans as “hostile” toward Hispanics and view Democrats as “increasingly welcoming,” according to polling conducted by America’s Voice, a major advocacy group for immigrants’ rights.
Mr. Obama has argued that legalizing illegal immigrants and giving them a chance to work could pour billions of dollars into federal and state treasuries, bringing the immigrants into the above-ground economy, where their wages will be higher.
But the legal fight over the amnesty has proved damaging to the president, after the Homeland Security Department admitted it violated a lower court’s order halting the entire program early last year. Judge Andrew S. Hanen is still pondering whether to sanction the Justice Department for its behavior, saying the lawyers misrepresented some facts in the case.
On Friday, the Justice Department insisted it didn’t try to mislead the judge, saying there was an “unintentional miscommunication that occurred here.”
Judge Hanen issued an order in February 2015 keeping Mr. Obama’s broad amnesty from taking effect, and last year a federal appeals court, in a 2-1 decision, upheld that ruling.

USA Today
Sometimes it seems the Supreme Court’s main purpose these days is to resolve disputes between Republicans and President Obama.
Toward the end of Obama’s first term, the court ruled on a challenge to his signature health care law. On Monday, as Obama approaches the end of his second term, the justices are set to consider his executive order that would allow millions of undocumented workers to avoid deportation.
Obama won the first of these cases. The court ruled, correctly in our view, that Obamacare's insurance mandate did not violate the Constitution. The president's backers hope and believe that the court will take a similar tack in U.S. v. Texas, finding that the case is a political squabble dressed up as a legal dispute.
That, however, would be a mistake.
To be sure, Obama’s quest to reform the immigration system is a worthy cause. Keeping millions of undocumented immigrants in a state of legal limbo makes little sense.
Like his predecessor, George W. Bush, Obama backed legislation to grant these immigrants a path to legal status while beefing up border enforcement and making needed changes to the legal immigration system. That legislation passed with bipartisan support in the Senate but ran into a buzz saw of opposition from conservatives in the House.
'U.S. v. Texas' is a masquerade: Opposing view
Faced with legislative gridlock, the president acted unilaterally. Obama’s 2014 order, known as the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, combined with a predecessor order he issued two years earlier, would allow as many as 5 million of the estimated 11 million undocumented people to remain in the United States without fear of deportation.
While courts have typically given great deference to presidents in matters of immigration, this is simply too sweeping a policy change to exclude the legislative branch. It does the right thing in the wrong way.
The order has many flaws. Because it could be rescinded by a future president, it would not give immigrants the certainty they'd need to come out from the shadows and fully participate in their communities. Because it addresses only undocumented workers, it would do nothing for backlogs in legal immigration and a shortage of skilled workers.
The order's biggest flaw, however, is the precedent it would set by giving the president sweeping authority to interpret immigration laws virtually any way he or she sees fit. The same people who think Obama should have broad powers over immigration enforcement will feel a lot differently if a Republican wins the White House in November.
Imagine what orders Ted Cruz or Donald Trump would issue if elected president. Trump has advocated mass deportations, temporarily banning entry of foreign Muslims, and building a border wall financed by confiscating the remittances that undocumented workers attempt to send to their families back home.
In an interview with NBC News this year, Trump said he wouldn't hesitate to issue executive orders, noting that Obama had “led the way” with his actions.
The court would be wise to limit the president's authority in this area, and leave Congress and the White House to work out through the legislative process how to handle undocumented immigrants, as maddening as that might be.

3445,"OPINION: On Immigration, the law is on Obama's SIde""",Guest Writer - Left,4/18/2016,,,http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/opinion/on-immigration-law-is-on-obamas-side.html,"THE legal controversy surrounding the Obama administration’s immigration enforcement policies will soon come to a head when the Supreme Court justices hear the case United States v. Texas on Monday. Texas claims that the president’s executive decisions lack legal sanction by Congress and have injured the state.
But whether or not you like President Obama’s actions, he has operated under longstanding provisions of law that give the executive branch discretion in enforcement. This presidential prerogative has been recognized explicitly by the Supreme Court. Moreover, the nature of immigration enforcement and the resources (or lack thereof) appropriated by Congress necessitate exactly the type of choices that the president has made.
Congress has repeatedly granted the executive branch broad power in enforcing immigration laws. The 2002 law creating the Department of Homeland Security explicitly said the executive should set “national immigration enforcement policies and priorities.” The Supreme Court has recognized the leeway Congress gives the executive branch in deportations. In a 2012 majority opinion written by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., the court noted that “a principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials,” including the decision “whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all.”
Setting enforcement priorities is vital to the effectiveness of our immigration laws. Congress can’t anticipate every situation. This is why the Supreme Court recognized in 1950 that immigration law is an area where “flexibility and the adaptation of the congressional policy to infinitely variable conditions constitute the essence of the program.”"

Ted Cruz took on President Barack Obama’s open-border immigration policies by recounting stories of home invasion and murder that have plagued Americans, Arizona residents and border ranchers.
Cruz emphasized his position on border security and against illegal immigration ahead of Tuesday’s Arizona presidential primary contest. Border security has been a central focus of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump that helped launch his popularity in the early stages of his campaign.
Cruz addressed reporters from on the border in Douglas, Arizona as shown on Fox Business:
Cruz says he’ll listen more than talk, so border region ranchers can describe the harrowing experiences they face on a day to day basis. He recounted how the Arizonans face volumes of drug trafficking. He said one woman told a story of being monitored by a drug smuggler who figured out where she hid her house key. That smuggler has somewhat regularly used that key to enter her home “take a shower, make a meal, wash the dishes, go to bed, sleep, get up and leave and lock the door behind him.”
Cruz also challenged Obama that if the border is as secure as the president says it is then he should try moving the White House down to the southern border. “The ranchers here deal every day with the threats, the threats that tragically took the life of a well-respected rancher not to far from here. Threats that challenge our basic safety and security.”
Cruz spoke of ranchers who come across dead bodies left behind by smugglers and the negligible and nonexistent border fence. “Far too often [human smugglers] abandon women or children, those who are sick, they abandon them in the desert to die. This is a national security crisis. And it’s a crisis that the federal government is refusing to do it’s job in solving.” He described the smugglers as “hardened, vicious, violent criminals.”
Cruz also brought in a father who tells the story of how his young adult son was murdered by a cartel member illegal alien for no apparent reason. Steve Ronnebeck appears in a new ad supporting Cruz telling the story of his son and stating the he trusts Cruz to tear up Obama’s de facto amnesty executive action on immigration.
“I trust Ted Cruz,” Ronnebeck says in the ad, “I trust that he’s going to do the things he says he’s going to do.” Ronnebeck, who lost his 21-year-old son Grant in January 2015, wrote a detailed explanation of his support for Cruz in a February article for Breitbart News.
Cruz tweeted an image of his trip to the Arizona border with a link to his immigration plan for America:

Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry also appeared at the border press conference the day after making several Arizona stops to stump for Cruz. The Texas senator also made mention of and thanked Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels and Arizona State Representative David Gowan who were also present.
Trump has won the endorsement of two prominent Arizonans in former Gov. Jan Brewer and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
In recent days Cruz picked up the endorsement of Arizona Rep. David Schweikert. Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ) endorsed Cruz last week.

It fueled national protests and boycotts, but also helped her win a second term, creating two images of Arizona: to some, a synonym for intolerance; to others, an example of how fed-up citizens and elected officials could fight back against illegal immigration.
Representative Ruben Gallego, a Democrat from Phoenix, said in an interview, “Our immigration laws have been a very effective tool to mobilize the right, and it’s once again going to reward a politician who’s going to be preying on people’s anxieties, be it Cruz or Trump.”
Today, the state has fewer undocumented immigrants than it did in 2009, according to an analysis by the Pew Hispanic Center. And based on census numbers, scholars at the Morrison Institute for Public Policy at Arizona State University projected that four in five of the state’s Latino residents will be a United States citizen by 2030.
Apprehensions by the Border Patrol have been on the decline, falling by 25 percent in the last fiscal year alone, in part because Mexico’s improved economy has given fewer of its citizens reason to risk the perilous crossing.
Still, profound challenges remain, fueled by geography — the border between Arizona and Mexico runs for about 370 miles — and opportunity. This month, Border Patrol agents arrested a convicted sex offender who had previously been deported as well as a man wanted for murder in Maricopa County as they tried to enter the country illegally."
3875,"Appeals Court Upholds Delay Of Obama's Executive Action On Immigration""",HuffPost,11/10/2015,,,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dapa-appeals-court_564145d0e4b0b24aee4b9ab1,"A federal appeals court on Monday agreed to keep on hold President Barack Obama's executive order on immigration -- nearly a year after he announced it as a backstop measure to Congress' failure to enact comprehensive immigration reform.
The divided, 124-page ruling deals a blow to the administration's Deferred Action for Parental Accountability program, known as DAPA, and there may be just enough time for a formal appeal to the Supreme Court to be resolved ahead of the 2016 election.
In ruling against the government, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit largely agreed with a lower court judge, who in February issued a “nationwide injunction” that effectively stopped DAPA from taking effect, and concurred that Texas and other states that sued the president over the program had legal “standing” to challenge its constitutionality in federal court.
The appeals court accepted Texas’ argument that an expansion of immigration relief to include a wider class of undocumented immigrants would cause the state to “incur significant costs in issuing driver’s licenses to DAPA beneficiaries” -- a basic “harm” requirement for any litigant seeking standing to sue.
“If permitted to go into effect, DAPA would enable at least 500,000 illegal aliens in Texas to satisfy that requirement with proof of lawful presence or employment authorization,” wrote U.S. Circuit Judge Jerry Smith for the 2-to-1 appeals court. “Texas subsidizes its licenses and would lose a minimum of $130.89 on each one it issued to a DAPA beneficiary. Even a modest estimate would put the loss at several million dollars.”
The court rejected the federal government's argument that extending relief to a wide swath of immigrants would offset the injury to the state by bringing in increased tax revenue and other benefits. A study by the Center for American Progress estimated DAPA, if implemented, would benefit up to 3.7 million individuals.
""Once an injury is shown, no attempt is made to ask whether the injury is outweighed by benefits the plaintiff has enjoyed from the relationship with the defendant,"" Smith reasoned. ""Standing is recognized to complain that some particular aspect of the relationship is unlawful and has caused injury.""
Writing in dissent, Judge Carolyn Dineen King questioned whether the court's ruling failed to ""articulate a standard or a rule that can be applied by lawyers and judges in future cases,"" and compared it to a ""railway ticket decision -- good only for this day and season.""
""Today’s decision is either just such a 'railway ticket' ... or a broad, new-fangled concept of state standing with little instruction going forward,"" King wrote.
King also took issue with the court's untimeliness in deciding the case, which potentially affects the administration's ability to appeal to the Supreme Court.
""I have a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been made,"" she wrote. ""That mistake has been exacerbated by the extended delay that has occurred in deciding this 'expedited' appeal. There is no justification for that delay.""
Based on how the high court accepts and decides cases on appeal, advocates and experts have warned that undue delays from the 5th Circuit would foreclose administration lawyers from appealing the ruling in time before Obama leaves office -- which in turn leaves the fate of DAPA in the hands of his White House successor.
But supporters of Obama's immigration policies said there's still time for the Supreme Court to get involved.
""The Supreme Court recognized just three and a half years ago that a principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials, including whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all,"" said a statement from Brianne Gorod, an appellate lawyer with the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center, which filed a brief in the Texas case. ""The Supreme Court should reaffirm that principle, recognizing that the president’s immigration initiative is simply an exercise of that lawful discretion, and allow the program to be implemented immediately.""
The ruling asserts that ""the separation of powers remains the law of the land, and the president must follow the rule of law, just like everybody else,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement. “Throughout this process, the Obama administration has aggressively disregarded the constitutional limits on executive power, and Texas, leading a charge of 26 states, has secured an important victory to put a halt to the president’s lawlessness.""
For advocates, like the National Immigration Law Center's Maria Hincapié, a swift appeal would bring some ease to those most affected by the uncertainty over the DAPA program.
""Immigrant families and their U.S. citizen children have been waiting anxiously for the 5th Circuit to rule,"" Hincapié told Politico. ""Now, we call on the DOJ to seek [review] before the Supreme Court immediately where we are more likely to obtain justice for our communities.""

3980,The myth of the \xe2\x80\x98anchor baby\xe2\x80\x99 deportation defense',Washington Post,8/21/2015,,,http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/20/the-myth-of-the-anchor-baby-deportation-defense/,"It's the former, known as ""birthright citizenship,"" which is delineated in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. And as all sorts of public figures have discussed the future of the 14th Amendment this week, the more colloquial -- many say pejorative -- term ""anchor baby"" has come up over and over again.
But the anchor baby, while potent politically, is a largely mythical idea.
AD
Here's the basic concept: People, namely women, come to the United States illegally and give birth to children, generally for the specific purpose of bolstering legal attempts of the child's parents remain in the United States or even become citizens themselves.
AD
Looser definitions suggest ""anchor babies"" can simply be intended to help illegal-immigrant parents access taxpayer-financed public education and/or social services through their citizen children -- another political hot button, to be sure. (Even here, the law limits those benefits to the children themselves.)
But usually the debate has been about the residency of the parents, who after all are supposed to be using the child as their ""anchor.""
AD
This is the definition that has little legal underpinning. For illegal immigrant parents, being the parent of a U.S. citizen child almost never forms the core of a successful defense in an immigration court. In short, if the undocumented parent of a U.S.-born child is caught in the United States, he or she legally faces the very same risk of deportation as any other immigrant.
The only thing that a so-called anchor baby can do to assist either of their undocumented parents involves such a long game that it's not a practical immigration strategy, said Greg Chen, an immigration law expert and director of The American Immigration Lawyers Association, a trade group that also advocates for immigrant-friendly reforms. That long game is this: If and when a U.S. citizen reaches the age of 21, he or she can then apply for a parent to obtain a visa and green card and eventually enter the United States legally.
In order to apply for such an option, the parent of a so-called anchor baby would need to do all of the following.
AD
AD
Wait for his or her child to reach the age of 21.
Leave the United States.
Return to their home country.
Have their child begin the lengthy process of applying for a family reunification immigration request.
Clear consular interviews and a U.S. State Department background check. (One or both would very likely provide evidence that said parent, at some point, lived in the United States illegally -- long enough for that ""anchor baby"" to be conceived or born. And despite widespread belief to the contrary, there is indeed a penalty for that.)
If a person has lived in the United States unlawfully for a period of more than 180 days but less than one year, there is an automatic three-year bar on that person ever reentering the United States -- and that's before any wait time for a visa. So that's a minimum of 21 years for the child to mature, plus the three-year wait.
And, for the vast majority of these parents, a longer wait also applies. If a person has lived in the United States illegally for a year or more, there is a 10-year ban on that person reentering the United States. So, in that case, there would be the 21-year wait for the child to mature to adulthood, plus the 10-year wait.
All told, the parents of the so-called anchor baby face a 24-to-31-year wait to even enter the United States, much less obtain a visa and green card or become a citizen.
AD
AD
Immigration courts routinely reject claims that an undocumented parent must remain in the United States to care for a U.S. citizen child. The main but rare legal exceptions are for children who are so seriously ill or profoundly disabled that one parent must care for them full-time, or for a child in need of medical care unavailable in their parents' home country.
These parents are given something called ""humanitarian parole,"" Chen explained. And this is very rarely applied to people already living in the United States illegally. It is more often given to the parents of, say, an Afghan war burn victim who want to accompany their child to the United States for medical care. And, even then, humanitarian parole is generally granted for limited period of time.

Alternatively, these parents can apply for something even more rare: an extreme hardship exception, according to Deborah Anker, a clinical professor of law and director of the Harvard University Law School’s immigration and refugee clinical program. Very rarely they can apply for a waiver that may allow them to reenter the United States sooner, Anker said. But if that request is denied, there is no form of appeal available. Decisions are final.
Yes, it is true that some undocumented immigrants come to the United States and have children with or perhaps even because of the mistaken belief that this will strengthen a legal bid to remain in the United States. Mistaken beliefs have spurred previous surges in illegal immigration -- including last year's.
And it is true that some people -- such as breast-feeding mothers, children brought to the United States illegally as children and others -- have benefited from the immigration system equivalent of proprietorial discretion, known as ""deferred action.""

But with the exception of an Obama administration program known as DACA (limited to an estimated 1.2 million young adults brought to the United States illegally as children) and a second program currently blocked by a federal court that would have granted deferred action to another 300,000 people (mostly the parents of those eligible for DACA), deferred actions typically come with a short and limited timeline. They also do not include a pathway to a visa or legal work in the United States. And these programs did not exist when the concept of an ""anchor baby"" was politically popularized, so it becomes harder to accept the idea that having an ""anchor baby"" was the express goal of many people immigrating illegally.
It's also important to note that, as of August 2014, only about 550,000 DACA applications had been approved, according to a Pew research Center analysis of federal data. And even these applicants must wait until their 21st birthday to begin the lengthy process described above to attempt to help an undocumented parent. And ""attempt"" is the key word here.
And if you're still skeptical, here's the real proof that having a baby in the United States does little to help an undocumented parent remain in the United States, there's this:

GOP presidential candidates are falling over themselves to get on record with tough immigration plans. A string of them — Rand Paul, Chris Christie, Lindsey Graham, Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal and Rick Santorum — have spoken out in some form against birthright citizenship. That's the idea that being born on U.S. soil, regardless of your parents' legal status, automatically makes you a U.S. citizen.
Ben Carson went even further, saying he wants to secure the border — where he claims there are caves in which immigrants can hide — by using drones.
""You look at some of these caves and things out there, one drone strike, boom, and they're gone,"" Carson said.
When it comes to the issue of birthright citizenship, while some conservatives disagree, a lot of legal scholars believe it is settled law, enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and that it therefore would be fantastically difficult to overturn.
The flurry of tough positions on birthright citizenship is yet another sign of the power front-runner Donald Trump, with his inflammatory immigration rhetoric, has in the 2016 GOP race. The question for other Republicans is how to take tough — but still palatable for a general election — stances on the issue.
Both Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush have defended birthright citizenship, but they have said more needs to be done about women who might come into the U.S. expressly to have children. It's unclear exactly what they would — or could — actually do.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Darren McCollester/Getty Images Darren McCollester/Getty Images
""If there's abuse, if people are bringing, pregnant women are coming in to have babies simply because they can do it, then there ought to be greater enforcement,"" Bush told conservative radio host Bill Bennett this week, as reported by Politico. ""That's [the] legitimate side of this. Better enforcement so that you don't have these, you know, 'anchor babies,' as they're described, coming into the country.""
When pressed on his use of the phrase ""anchor babies,"" Bush defended it. ""If there's another term that I come up with, I'm happy to hear it,"" he said Thursday. (Hillary Clinton jumped at the opportunity, tweeting, ""They're called babies."")
Rubio told voters in Iowa this week, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, ""I'm open to doing things that prevent people who deliberately come to the U.S. for purposes of taking advantage of the 14th Amendment, but I'm not in favor of repealing it.""
The problem is that it's not certain exactly what the government could do to stop this from happening. (Neither the Bush nor the Rubio campaign has responded to requests for comment from NPR.)
What the U.S. could do to prevent (the few) ""birth tourists""
The closest thing to a law that could slow foreign women from having babies in the U.S. is that you can't lie about why you want a visa to the U.S., said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute's office at New York University.
""If you're a Chinese woman coming to the U.S. as a tourist, you are making a representation to the U.S. government that I am coming to be a tourist,"" Chishti said. ""If it is established by a consular officer that the woman is not really coming for tourism, but is coming to deliver a baby, you can deny the visa. There's no doubt about that.""
But that's tough to enforce under current regulations, says Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that tends to advocate tighter immigration policies.
""It's not illegal [for a foreign tourist to have a baby in the U.S.], though the State Department could put through regulation if they wanted to try to stop it,"" he says, for example, by more pointedly asking pregnant women if they're coming simply to have a baby in the U.S.
This phenomenon of having a child on a tourist visa has come to be known as ""birth tourism,"" and many of the stories about it in the past few years have tended to center around women coming from China, where families are restricted in the number of children they can have.
In addition to asking more questions of pregnant women entering the country on tourist visas, likewise, Chishti said the government could crack down more on the clinics — or ""maternity hotels,"" as they are called — where these women routinely go to give birth.
Of course, that only applies to those who go through the visa process. The number of ""birth tourists"" may indeed be very small. Earlier this year, the Center on Immigration Studies, which favors more tightly monitoring ""birth tourism,"" estimated that there are 36,000 such women annually.
Stopping other immigrants from having children is a different story
But there are millions of people who entered the country illegally. Because the law didn't detect many of them when they came in, trying to stop them from having children is difficult, to say the least.
Likewise, millions of people came in legally but have overstayed their visas. Improving the entry-exit monitoring system could do a lot to bring down the number of people who are in the country illegally, Chishti said. But that doesn't mean anything about their children.
""To be sure, this recommendation applies to reducing the pool of unauthorized in general,"" he said, but ""does not specifically address the 'anchor babies' phenomenon, because most likely mothers would deliver babies during their periods of authorized stay.""
It's also possible that trying to crack down on the birthright phenomenon simply means tightening existing laws and enforcement. Krikorian says that would have been a smarter answer to the birthright question for Bush and Rubio.
""A better-thought-out, more humane response would have been, when we enforce immigration laws better, in general, there will be fewer people here to give birth who are not citizens or green card holders,"" he says. But as it stands, he adds, simply calling for better enforcement against these so-called ""anchor babies"" is, to him, a non-answer.
""It's their way of seeming responsive without supporting a change in our citizenship practices,"" he says.
So, how many children are born to illegal immigrants every year?
There are no exact counts on the number of U.S. children with parents who are in the U.S. illegally, but some organizations have tried to count.
The Pew Research Center found in a 2012 report that around 5.5 percent of all K-12 students were U.S.-born citizens who also had at least one parent who was not authorized to be in the U.S. Still, many of those children may have one parent who is here legally.
The center also estimated in 2008 that 340,000 of the 4.3 million children born in the U.S. — not quite 8 percent — were born to immigrants who were in the U.S. illegally.
Those are rough estimates, but they suggest that while the so-called ""anchor baby"" population is relatively small, the practice of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally having babies in the U.S. is a very real phenomenon.
And that puts candidates in the tough spot not only of deciding whether they think that's a problem, but also if and how they could fix it."

His latest proposal: revoke the citizenship of American-born children of undocumented immigrants, a right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.
On Fox News' ""The O'Reilly Factor"" on Tuesday night, the GOP's presidential frontrunner envisioned kicking all 11 million undocumented immigrants out of the country.
""Do you envision federal police kicking in the doors in barios around the country, dragging families out and putting them on a bus? Do you envision that?"" host Bill O'Reilly asked.
""I don't think they have American citizenship,"" he replied. ""And if you speak to very good lawyers, and I know some would disagree, (but) many agree with me, you will find they do not have American citizenship.""
Trump hasn't said how he would implement his ambitious immigration plan. In New Hampshire Wednesay he talked about building what he calls a beautiful wall.
""I will build the greatest wall that you've ever seen,"" he said. ""I want it to be so beautiful because maybe someday they're gonna call it the Trump Wall, maybe. So I have to make sure it's beautiful, right? I'll be very proud of that wall.""
Up the road at another event in New Hampshire, Jeb Bush took a few swipes at Trump, saying he's not a true conservative.
""Mr. Trump doesn't have a proven, conservative record,"" Bush said. ""He was a Democrat longer in the last decade than he was a Republican. He's given more money to Democrats than he's given to Republicans.""
""Even on immigration, where it's -- you know, look, it's, the language is pretty vitriolic for sure. But hundreds of billions of dollars of cost to implement his plan is not a conservative plan,"" he added."

Donald Trump, a political amateur, has won the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 primary.
It wasn't a formal scheduled TV debate. That political circus doesn't debut on Fox News until next month.
The debate Trump won was the one dealing with illegal immigrants from Mexico that he started three weeks ago when he officially announced he was running for president.
Trump, who didn't bother to use a prepared speech or read from a teleprompter, said blunt and unfriendly things about his fellow GOP candidates and their lousy leadership skills, which the liberal mainstream media gleefully reported.
But what the pundits, many Republicans and the media really went ballistic over was the way Trump characterized the country's illegal immigrants from Mexico.
In case you've forgotten, he said, ""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best.... They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us (sic). They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.""
The 69-year-old billionaire was trying to make a point about the problem of illegal immigrants who come here and commit crimes, but he was winging it and he messed up.
Trump made his point, but he got it backwards. Most - not "" some"" - of the 5.9 million illegal immigrants from Mexico who live in the USA are good people.
If Trump were not Trump, he should have hired someone to write a speech for him that said something like:
""Though they have broken the law to enter the United States, most of the Mexican people who've come here are good people who want to work hard and better their lives. But thousands of them are not good people and they are committing crimes like sexual assault, rape and murder after they get here.
""We have to prevent those bad people from getting into our country in the first place and we have to deport them or jail them immediately when they commit serious crimes.""
But Trump being Trump, he was more interested in calling attention to the problem than being politically correct.
Predictably, the mainstream media went after Trump. It made him and the clumsy things he said about Mexicans the big story and reporters went around asking the other GOP candidates what they thought about what Trump said, not what they thought about immigration.
Those candidates gave their usual crafted political answers, kowtowing to the mainstream media by dumping on Trump.
Ironically, though, Trump got the last word.
Because of him calling attention to criminality among illegal Mexican immigrants, the issue has become a hot media topic.
Instead of ignoring or downplaying crimes committed by ""unauthorized"" immigrants, as the Pew Research Center now calls illegals, the mainstream media have finally started reporting some of the most horrible examples.
The recent murder of a San Francisco woman by an immigrant who had been deported five times has made the biggest headlines.
There's also the illegal immigrant in Texas who killed his wife with a hammer and the one in Arizona who injured a mother and two kids in a hit-and-run. Both immigrants had been deported multiple times.
The statistics about how many illegal immigrants commit serious crimes, or whether they commit more per capita than U.S. citizens, are debatable and hard to come by, largely because the government doesn't care to tally them.
But what's undebatable is that tens of thousands of this country's total 12 million illegal immigrants commit serious crimes each year and we have to do something about it.
Trump, without trying, brought attention to a major issue in a way no other candidate could or would. While the other GOP candidates talked about him, he was talking about a major issue of the 2016 campaign.
Therefore, he started - and ultimately won - the first debate of the GOP's 2016 primary. I bet it won't be the last time he outpoints the professional politicians and their consultants."

6700,Surprise! Donald Trump is wrong about immigrants and crime.',Washington Post,7/9/2015,,,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/07/02/surprise-donald-trump-is-wrong-about-immigrants-and-crime/,"Donald Trump speaks to supporters during a back-yard reception in Bedford, N.H., on June 30. (Dominick Reuter/Reuters)
Donald Trump's two-week-old campaign has been pretty good at sticking to two core points: defending the candidate's anti-immigrant remarks at his announcement and pretending that the companies that responded to those comments by ending their business relationships with him were, instead, rejected by him first.
As a result, we've gotten a wonderful look at the unassailable way in which Trump's mind works: He's always right, until he's not, in which case he was never wrong. You were.
Take the statements that started all of Trump's troubles; they came within the first few minutes of his campaign kick-off, after he rambled for a bit about the crowd and the Islamic State and Japan.
""When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,"" he said. ""They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.""
With all of the furor that resulted, it's worth noting the two hallmarks of classic Donald Trump that emerged from his response. First, he unfailingly stood by the comments, despite the fallout. And second, he's wrong.
On CNN on Wednesday night, he offered a defense to anchor Don Lemon.
""If you look at the statistics, of people coming ... I didn't say about Mexico, I say the illegal immigrants —if you look at the statistics on rape, on crime, on everything, coming in illegally to the country, they're mind-boggling,"" he told Lemon.
Every part of that is incorrect. He did say his comments about Mexico — explicitly. And data show that new immigrants — including illegal immigrants — are actually less likely to commit crime, not more.
To wit:
—""Foreign-born individuals exhibit remarkably low levels of involvement in crime across their life course."" (Bianca Bersani, University of Massachusetts, 2014. Published in Justice Quarterly.)
Citing Bersani's work, Pew Research created this graph, showing crime rates among the immigrant community.
""The crime rate among first-generation immigrants — those who came to this country from somewhere else — is significantly lower than the overall crime rate and that of the second generation,"" they write.
Since undocumented immigrants are more than a quarter of the immigrant population, it's nearly impossible that the overall-immigrant crime rate could be so much lower if the undocumented-immigrant crime rate were significantly higher.
— ""There’s essentially no correlation between immigrants and violent crime."" (Jörg Spenkuch, Northwestern University, 2014. Published by the university.) He did find a small correlation between immigration and property crime, but only a slight one.
— ""[I]mmigrants are underrepresented in California prisons compared to their representation in the overall population. In fact, U.S.-born adult men are incarcerated at a rate over two-and-a-half times greater than that of foreign-born men."" (Public Policy Institute of California, 2008.)
— ""[D]ata from the census and a wide range of other empirical studies show that for every ethnic group without exception, incarceration rates among young men are lowest for immigrants, even those who are the least educated. This holds true especially for the Mexicans, Salvadorans and Guatemalans, who make up the bulk of the undocumented population."" (Ruben Rumbaut, University of California, 2008. Published by the Police Foundation.)
— ""Analyses of data collected from four Southwest states and the U.S. Census show that the perceived size of the undocumented immigrant population, more so than the actual size of the immigrant population and economic conditions, is positively associated with perceptions of undocumented immigrants as a criminal threat."" (Xia Wang, Arizona State University, 2014. Published in Criminology.)
How did Trump get a simple point so wrong? Consider the response he offered Lemon on his most contentious assertion. Trump offers a sort of ontological rationalization for the ""rapists"" claim: People are being raped, ergo it's the immigrants' fault.
Trump cited an article from Fusion. ""Eighty percent of the women coming in ... "" he says, trailing off. ""You have to take a look at these stories. ... It's unbelievable, when you look at what's going on. All I'm doing is telling the truth.""
Lemon correctly points out that the story was about immigrant women being raped. ""Well,"" Trump replies, ""someone's doing the raping, Don."" In apparent disbelief, Trump adds, ""How can you say such a thing?""
And there you go. Trump completely misreads a media story, turns it into a mushy stat in his head, and uses that as an excuse to bash immigrants without cause. The stat is nowhere near accurate, but that doesn't matter. When he's presented with accurate data, he offers a weird rationale — and then criticizes his critic. Perfect.
In the wake of his announcement, we dubbed Trump to be ""un-fact-checkable"" for the simple reason that he so often operates outside the bounds of logical discourse. Same here. Trump has septupled down on his bad argument — assuming, as has happened so many times before, that it will all go away.
It probably won't until, almost invariably, his candidacy does."
3191,"OPINION: Don't blame all immigrants for San Francisco shooting""",CNN (Web News),7/8/2015,,,http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/05/opinions/reyes-shooter-doesnt-represent-immigrants/index.html,"Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyes . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.
(CNN) As the nation was preparing for the July Fourth weekend, there was grim news from San Francisco. On Wednesday night, Kate Steinle , 31, was fatally shot, apparently randomly, while walking with her father on a busy pier. A Mexican immigrant, who CNN reported was in the country without documentation, was arrested in her death.
Illegally re-entering the country after being deported, as Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez is said to have done, is a federal felony . He has also been accused of a horrific, violent crime. And according to immigration authorities, he has seven other felony convictions, including four for drug offenses.
But that doesn't make him a symbol of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Nor is he the poster boy for out-of-control illegal immigration across our southern border (illegal immigration from Mexico is at a 40-year low). He does not represent the overwhelming majority of immigrants in this country -- legal or otherwise -- who are productive members of society.
Lopez-Sanchez is simply a dangerous individual who should not have been free and among us.
It is a myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime. Research from the Immigration Policy Center shows that crime rates fell in the United States as the size of our immigrant population, including undocumented immigrants, grew from 1990 to 2010.

The Washington Post just analyzed Donald Trump's recent comments about Mexican immigrants being drug dealers and ""rapists"" and found that he was wrong about immigrants and crime. Remember, being in the country without authorization is not a crime -- it is a civil infraction.
Most undocumented immigrants come to the United States to work and provide a better life for themselves and their families.
Consider that several mass shootings, from Aurora to Newtown to Charleston, were committed by young white men. Does that mean that all young white men are potential mass murderers? Of course not.
The same news outlets that are now trumpeting Wednesday's murder as proof that undocumented immigrants are criminals often overlook or ignore other stories of undocumented immigrants who are genuine heroes. In 2013, an undocumented immigrant rescued a mother and her child on Staten Island, New York, amidst the storm surge of Superstorm Sandy.
JUST WATCHED DREAMer fights her family's deportation Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH DREAMer fights her family's deportation 02:50
One takeaway from this episode is that deporting as many undocumented immigrants as possible is not the answer to our immigration problems. Lopez-Sanchez had been deported five times, and yet he was still here in the country without authorization.
Back in 2011, the deputy director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement told an immigration subcommittee of Congress that it costs $12,500 to deport a person. Multiply this by five and that is how much taxpayer money was wasted on a criminal who remained at large to randomly take the life of an innocent young woman.
Another lesson here is our country does not need more immigration enforcement; our country needs smarter and better immigration enforcement. Up to now, immigration authorities have wasted time, manpower and money chasing after people working productively in their communities as, say, gardeners and maids, while felons like Lopez-Sanchez slipped through the cracks.
That's why it was good news last week that the Department of Homeland Security announced it is rethinking its deportation priorities to focus on recent arrivals and serious criminals.
This move is a step in the right direction, because it is time to start seriously targeting those immigrants who are a real threat to public safety. The government will be focusing its enforcement efforts on three categories of people: convicted criminals, recent border crossers and terrorism threats.

True, Lopez-Sanchez should not have been in the country, or he should have at least been behind bars. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement erred in not seeking a warrant or court order for his arrest and he was released in accordance with city law in March.
What's more, President Barack Obama's proposed executive action on immigration, currently tied up in a legal battle, might also have made a difference because it would have freed up resources to go after people like Lopez-Sanchez.
The executive action would have given deportation relief to parents of DREAMers, while allowing DHS to zero in on criminals. Instead, despite the fact that our country spends more on immigration enforcement than all other law enforcement agencies combined, our system failed Kate Steinle.
Although Steinle's death was a tragedy, it was the alleged action of one man. All undocumented immigrants do not deserve to be vilified by false association."

Illegal immigration is one of those topics on which almost everyone has an opinion -- maybe several opinions. But when it comes to the facts, the number of people with a grasp on them is a lot smaller.
Donald Trump, a contender for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, said last month that illegal immigrants coming across the U.S.-Mexico border are in large part ""rapists"" and ""murderers."" And in San Francisco, the shooting death of Kathryn Steinle, 31, allegedly caused by man who has been deported multiple times and convicted of a series of very serious crimes, has set off a new wave of concern about immigration and so-called ""sanctuary cities"" like San Francisco.
It's a lot. That's why there is a Part I and a Part II to this post. But we've tried to boil it down to the essentials for your next immigration-related debate.
If a person is in the United States illegally, why isn't he or she arrested and shipped back to his or her home country immediately?
This is one of those places where the country's commitment to freedom and liberty get a real road test.
As mentioned above, immigration is often complicated. At least some portion of the people who do enter the country illegally or overstay the terms of their visitor or student visas also have legitimate asylum claims. Asylum is limited to individuals who can provide evidence that they have faced persecution or might be killed if they return to their home country. And U.S. law says that most people caught inside the United States should be given a chance to make those claims in an immigration court. (For more information on asylum seekers, see Tables 16 and 17 here).
Now, layer on top of that more than 445,000 people awaiting immigration hearings. Most of these people cannot make a successful asylum claim but might have some other legal defense such as proof of a U.S. citizen parent or grandparent.
Unauthorized immigrants caught inside the United States -- or in some cases at the border -- generally get a hearing in one of the nation's deeply backlogged immigration courts. Wait times now stretch into 2019.
That means that federal immigration authorities also have to make decisions about whom to hold during that wait and whom to release and trust to show up again.
How many people does the United States deport each year?
The data reporting here lags a bit behind and, of course, varies from year to year. But on average, between 2011 and 2013, immigration courts ordered about 414,650 people out in one way or another. Here's the picture painted in the Department of Homeland Security's most recent annual immigration data report, for 2013.
What is a ""sanctuary city,"" anyway?
The policies and practices differ in the estimated 60 sanctuary cities around the country. That list includes major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston. But generally, when someone has been, for instance, arrested for driving without a license and then identified as an illegal immigrant at a jail in a sanctuary city, they must serve jail time for state charges or pay related fines. Then, they are let go.
Most of these cities have identified some set of guidelines or conditions under which federal immigration officials must be alerted before the person's release. Usually they are connected to what's on the person's rap sheet.
But some either don't have them or don't follow them. For a deeper look at the role that San Francisco's sanctuary-city status has played in the immigration debate since the Steinle shooting, see this.
[California killing inflames debate on illegal imigrants, 'sanctuary cities.']
Once an undocumented immigrant has been arrested for committing a crime inside the United States, why do sanctuary cities let them go?
During the apex of the country's illegal immigration challenges, before the recession, law enforcement officials in some communities expressed concern about the practice of releasing these inmates after they had served time for state offenses. Some of those communities entered agreements to help federal authorities with immigration enforcement. This went on between 2004 and 2012.
These agreements allowed local jails to house undocumented immigrants after they had served time on state charges and bill the federal government for this service. Sometimes inmates were passed along to jails in other places without any formal notice to family members, then into the immigration court system for an expedited removal hearing. In many cases, people were returned to their home countries in weeks.
That program was widely criticized as a possible revenue stream for some local jails and a potential violation of international human rights accords. Some people were unable to communicate with embassy officials from their countries of origin or notify family members of their arrests, basically disappearing without explanation. Civil liberties groups called it a vehicle for racial and ethnic profiling. One Tennessee sheriff described it as part of his toolkit to ""stack these violators like cordwood."" In addition, more than one analysis of who was deported and what happened during that process showed that most were people initially arrested for minor traffic violations and who had no criminal record.
President Obama touted the fact that his administration had deported the largest number of people in U.S. history. (Read the more complicated truth here.) Meanwhile, immigrant advocates said all of this deeply damaged already-limited police trust in immigrant communities, making people afraid to call police or provide information. That, these advocates argued, was the real threat to public safety.
This is where sanctuary cities come in.
What happens in other cities?
After a series of changes, new programs and memos from the top that were supposed to assure that more of the nation's deportation apparatus got aimed at serious and violent criminals, the Department of Homeland Security is now asking communities to participate in a different program, this time called Priority Enforcement.
Priority Enforcement won't formally begin until later this summer, The Washington Post reported Tuesday. When it does, it will ask local law enforcement agencies to notify federal immigration authorities before the scheduled release of an immigrant targeted for deportation. Those targeted for deportation include people with violent and serious crime convictions. And federal officials told The Post that they did make just such a request to the folks in San Francisco.
Finally, is there any evidence that those who enter the country illegally commit more crime than others?
The Fix looked at this issue this week and found an answer that shouldn't really be surprising.
Like every population, there are some people who have immigrated to the United States illegally who go on to commit serious and misdemeanor crimes in this country. But immigrants of all kinds are actually less likely to commit crimes than those born inside the United States. (For more detail check out this post immediately.) Here's the big take away in one chart.
This chart highlights all immigrants, but it's important to note that more than one-quarter of all immigrants currently in the United States are undocumented. So a spike in their crime rate would likely mean the ""first generation"" line wouldn't be so low.
OK. We hope that helps."
2677,"Judge Temporarily Halts Obama's Immigration Actions""",HuffPost,2/17/2015,,,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/17/lawsuit-obama-immigration_n_6680366.html,"WASHINGTON -- A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction on Monday that will temporarily prevent the Obama administration from moving forward with its executive actions on immigration while a lawsuit against the president works its way through the courts.
The order, by Judge Andrew Hanen of the U.S. District Court in Brownsville, Texas, was an early stumble for the administration in what will likely be a long legal battle over whether President Barack Obama overstepped his constitutional authority with the wide-reaching executive actions on immigration he announced last November.
While the injunction does not pronounce Obama's actions illegal, it prevents the administration from implementing them until the court rules on their constitutionality.
The federal government is expected to appeal the ruling.
The impact of the order will be felt almost immediately: One of Obama's actions is set to take effect on Feb. 18. On that day, the administration was set to begin accepting applications for an expanded version of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. DACA allows undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to stay in the country and work legally.
Now, newly eligible immigrants seeking to apply will be unable to do so while the lawsuit is pending. The administration will also be unable to move forward, for now, with a DACA-like program created under Obama's executive actions. That program confers similar relief to undocumented immigrants who are parents of legal permanent residents or of U.S. citizens.
Hanen, who was appointed to the court by former President George W. Bush, said in the ruling that the 26 states who brought the suit had standing to do so, and indicated he was sympathetic to their arguments.
The lawsuit against the executive actions was filed in December. Texas is leading the effort, joined by Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
According to the suit, Obama's executive actions violate the Constitution, and allowing them to move forward would cause ""dramatic and irreparable injuries"" to the plaintiff states.
""This lawsuit is not about immigration,"" the complaint reads. ""It is about the rule of law, presidential power, and the structural limits of the U.S. Constitution.""
The White House has said that Obama acted within his authority and that the policies will allow immigration enforcement agents to focus on deporting higher-priority offenders such as convicted criminals, recent border-crossers and those who pose national security threats.
Attorneys general from 12 states and the District of Columbia signed onto an amicus brief in support of Obama's actions, asking the judge not to issue an injunction.
""The truth is that the directives will substantially benefit states, will further the public interest, and are well within the President’s broad authority to enforce immigration law,"" the amicus brief reads.
Obama's executive actions are at the center of a congressional impasse over funding the Department of Homeland Security. The dispute could cause an agency shutdown once funding runs out on Feb. 27. Most Republicans say they will only support a DHS funding bill if it includes measures to stop Obama's immigration policies, but those measures are being blocked by Senate Democrats. Even if such a bill were to reach the president's desk, Obama has said he would veto it.
The district court ruling was considered a potential game-changer for the funding fight, since some Republicans might be convinced to support a DHS funding bill with no immigration measures if Obama's actions were not moving forward anyway.
UPDATE: 8:20 a.m. -- White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest put out a statement early Tuesday defending the executive actions, which he said ""are consistent with the laws passed by Congress and decisions of the Supreme Court, as well as five decades of precedent by presidents of both parties who have used their authority to set priorities in enforcing our immigration laws.""
""The Department of Justice, legal scholars, immigration experts, and the district court in Washington, D.C. have determined that the President’s actions are well within his legal authority,"" Earnest continued. ""Top law enforcement officials, along with state and local leaders across the country, have emphasized that these policies will also benefit the economy and help keep communities safe. The district court’s decision wrongly prevents these lawful, commonsense policies from taking effect and the Department of Justice has indicated that it will appeal that decision."""

Two days before the first of President Obama's executive actions on immigration were to take effect, the new rules have been put on hold by a federal judge's ruling in South Texas. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen said the president overstepped his authority.
In more than 120 pages of court documents issued late Monday, Hanen halted both the new Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents as well as the expansions Obama had planned to make to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
If the executive actions providing legal status to millions of people were to take effect, Hanen wrote, ""The genie would be impossible to put back into the bottle.""
Speaking to reporters at the White House, President Obama said Justice Department will appeal this decision and he is confident that the executive action he took is ""well within my authority.""
""I strongly disagree with Judge Hanen's decision,"" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh C. Johnson said. But he adds that because of the injunction, his agency ""will not begin accepting requests for the expansion of DACA tomorrow, February 18, as originally planned. Until further notice, we will also suspend the plan to accept requests for DAPA.""
Johnson also stated that the court's order ""does not affect the existing DACA,"" and that it will not change the enforcement priorities he outlined when President Obama set his plan in motion last November.

Obama also called on Congress to act. He said he had taken this action, because he would not ""stand by and do nothing.""
He said while he disagreed with Hanen's opinion, ""I respect the ruling.""
Our original post continues:
The Justice Department will appeal the judge's temporary injunction, the White House says.
""The district court's decision wrongly prevents these lawful, commonsense policies from taking effect and the Department of Justice has indicated that it will appeal that decision,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement released Tuesday morning.
The injunction gives 26 states more time to form legal arguments against the actions, which were expected to protect as many as 4 million people who are in the U.S. illegally from being deported. The plan also includes an option to apply for work permits.
The states had argued that the changes would cause ""dramatic and irreparable injuries,"" as NPR's Richard Gonzales reports on Morning Edition. ""For example, the state of Texas estimates that it was spending $1.3 million sending police to deal with border security during that surge of unaccompanied minors that crossed the border this past summer.""
On the other side of the issue, Gonzales says, ""there are 12 states, the District of Columbia and 33 mayors across the country who are supporting the Obama administration. They say the executive action would benefit them, because workers who are here illegally would come out of the shadows and work and pay taxes.""
Obama announced his plan weeks after last November's midterm elections, saying that he was taking action because Congress hadn't sent him a bill addressing the problems in America's immigration system. Before the ruling came out late Monday, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency had been preparing to begin accepting applications under the new rules Wednesday.
As member-station KUT in Austin reports, the Texas lawsuit against the president's executive orders was initially filed in December by Gov. Greg Abbott, who was then the state's attorney general.
From the station and its partner, The Texas Tribune:
""[Abbott] accused the president of violating several provisions of the U.S. Constitution, including one that gives Congress jurisdiction over immigration laws. Abbott also argued that Texas would be irreparably harmed by the action. He cited as proof last summer's surge of undocumented immigrants from Central America who entered Texas illegally through the Rio Grande Valley.""
Welcoming the injunction, the current attorney general in Texas, Ken Paxton, called it ""a victory for the rule of law in America and a crucial first step in reining in President Obama's lawlessness.""
In his decision, Judge Hanen, an appointee of President George W. Bush who has been in his post since 2002, also noted that there has been a political and national debate over how to handle both legal and illegal immigration.
He added, ""To date, however, neither the President nor any member of Congress has proposed legislation capable of resolving these issues in a manner that could garner the necessary support to be passed into law."""
4208,"What You Need To Know About The Injunction Stopping Obama's Amnesty""",Townhall,2/17/2015,,,http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2015/02/17/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-injunction-stopping-obamas-amnesty-n1958369,"At 10:22 pm Monday night, the United States District Court for the Southern Division of Texas issued a temporary injunction enjoining the Department of Homeland Security from implementing ""any and all aspects of or phases of the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans or Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) program"" that President Obama announced on November 20, 2014. Here is what you need to know:
What did the court do? U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen entered an Order of Temporary Injunction enjoining DHS from implementing any aspect of Obama's ""DAPA Memorandum"" which includes an expansion of Obama's June 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. This means that the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services office may not begin accepting new DACA applications as it was scheduled to do this week, and if the order holds, may not begin accepting DAPA applications as it was scheduled to this May. As a result, an estimated four million illegal immigrants will not be given work permits, drivers licenses, or Social Security numbers as Obama originally envisioned.
What didn't the court do? This is only a temporary injunction that preserves the status quo until a more thorough court proceeding can rule on the merits of the case. That said, in order to secure a temporary injunction, one of the requirements a plaintiff must show is that they are ""likely to succeed on the merits."" Judge Hanen found that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that Obama's DAPA Memorandum violated the Administrative Procedures Act.
The court also left in place Obama's June 2012 DACA program. Only the DACA expansion outlined in the November 20 DAPA Memorandum, and the larger DAPA program, have been enjoined.
What happens next? The White House issued a statement early Tuesday morning indicating that the Department of Justice ""will appeal"" Judge Hanen's order. That appeal will be heard a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit who could issue a decision around July or August of this year. If the Obama administration lost that ruling, it could then appeal for an en banc ruling from the 5th Circuit before then appealing to the Supreme Court.
But the earliest the Supreme Court might here the case is March of 2016 and the earliest they could issue a decision would be June 2016, which is a huge problem for Obama since USCIS was expected to begin accepting DAPA application fees to pay for their new Crystal City office in May 2015.
How does these effect the DHS funding debate in Congress? Nobody knows. Speaker John Boehner issued a statement Tuesday urging ""Senate Democrats who claim to oppose this executive overreach"" to now ""let the Senate begin debate on a bill to fund the Homeland Security department."" The statement is a direct shot at Sens. Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Al Franken (D-MN), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Angus King (I-ME), Joe Manchin (D-WV), and Claire McCaskill (D-MO) all of whom have questioned the legality of Obama's amnesty but have voted to prevent any debate on the House Department of Homeland Security bill that defunds Obama's amnesty programs.
Since the order leaves the existing DACA program in place, while preventing the new DAPA program from being implemented, it is possible a compromise could be reached by both parties where the DHS bill would continue to defund the DAPA program, but Democratic Senators could offer amendments preserving DACA program. Moderate Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) has floated exactly such a compromise.

4894,House votes to cancel Obama amnesties',Washington Times,1/14/2015,,,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/14/house-votes-cancel-obama-amnesties/,"Brushing aside Democrats’ warnings of permanent political doom, House Republicans voted Thursday to cancel President Obama’s deportation amnesties, casting it as an effort to undo a runaway White House untethered either to the Constitution or its own words and promises.
In a debate freighted with political, symbolic and constitutional significance, House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, read 22 quotes from Mr. Obama denying he had powers to act unilaterally to halt deportations. The president claimed the powers last year when he announced an amnesty for more than 4 million illegal immigrants, granting them tentative legal status and work permits to compete legally for jobs.
“We do not take this action lightly, but there is simply no alternative,” Mr. Boehner said from the well of the House. “This is not a dispute between parties, or even branches of government. The president’s overreach is an affront to the rule of law and the Constitution itself.”
Democrats, no less strenuous in their defense of Mr. Obama, accused Republicans of mean-spiritedness with a series of votes to roll back Mr. Obama’s November amnesty and a smaller 2012 amnesty for Dreamers, or young adults brought to the U.S. as children.
“As a country, we’re better than this. Shame on you,” said Rep. Linda T. Sanchez of California, chairwoman of the House Hispanic Caucus.
The vote to cancel the November amnesty was 237-190, with seven Republicans joining Democrats in opposition. The vote to cancel the amnesty for Dreamers was less popular, passing on a 218-209 vote with 26 Republicans joining all Democrats in opposition.
White House officials and immigrant rights advocates feared the votes could send illegal immigrants back into the shadows.
But Cecilia Munoz, Mr. Obama’s domestic policy director, said the White House will make it clear to illegal immigrants that the president won’t be daunted.
“At the end of the day, we are confident we are going to be implementing these executive actions,” she said.
The courts could have a final say, however. Several challenges have been filed, including one in Texas, where 25 states have sued, arguing that they will have to fund billions of dollars worth of services to illegal immigrants if the president’s plans are allowed to stand.
A judge will hold a hearing Thursday on the states’ request for an injunction.
Wednesday’s fight was part of the debate on a bill to fund the Homeland Security Department and its immigration enforcement mission through the end of the fiscal year. That bill cleared the House on a 236-191 vote.
Mr. Obama has vowed to veto the bill because it includes the provisions canceling his amnesties, and Senate Democratic leaders said they will lead a filibuster to prevent the bill from even reaching the president’s desk.
That would leave homeland security funding in limbo, with a Feb. 27 deadline looming, and rank-and-file House Republicans acknowledged Wednesday that they aren’t sure about the next step.
“I don’t know that there is a Plan B,” said Rep. Peter T. King, a New York Republican who voted for the amendment to cancel the November amnesty but against the plan to scrap the Dreamer amnesty. “It’s a work in progress.”
Mr. King said there are six weeks to go before the deadline, which gives all sides a chance to work out an agreement.
House and Senate Republicans will gather Thursday and Friday in Pennsylvania for a policy retreat, where immigration is bound to take up much of the discussion.
Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican who opposed both amnesty amendments, said the effort was a waste because Republicans don’t have the votes to override a presidential veto.
“I wish that wasn’t the case. I wish President Obama was not in the White House. But that’s the reality,” he said.
All sides said Wednesday’s votes were momentous political statements and served as a signal of how much the immigration debate has changed over the past year.
House Republicans entered their annual policy retreat last year with Mr. Boehner announcing principles for tackling immigration, including legalizing the Dreamers and figuring out a solution for the rest of the illegal immigrant population. This year, Mr. Boehner led the charge to cancel the amnesty for Dreamers and to step up enforcement of immigration laws.
Republicans said the moves should be seen as statements on the Constitution and separation of powers, not as attacks on immigrants.
Democrats, though, said Hispanic voters won’t see it that way.
Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat who has been a staunch advocate for legalizing illegal immigrants, chided Republicans for backtracking on Mr. Boehner’s stance to legalize Dreamers.
“One year later, you want to take away from 600,000 Dreamers their right to live in this country. What happened? What happened?” Mr. Gutierrez said.
He vowed to make sure Hispanic voters punish Republicans for the votes: “The fruits of your action today will ultimately anger and outrage and [mobilize] the immigrant community throughout this nation.”
Democrats pointed to missives from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, the AFL-CIO and Hispanic rights groups who all blasted the amendments. The bishops said deporting illegal immigrants would fracture families, and labor unions said the moves were “anti-immigrant.”

3785,"House votes to block Obama's immigration actions - but exposes new GOP divisions""",Washington Post,1/14/2015,,,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/01/14/house-votes-to-block-obamas-immigration-actions-but-exposes-new-gop-divisions/,"This item has been updated.
House Republicans voted Wednesday to undo years of President Obama's immigration policies, launching a fresh attack on his executive actions as part of a plan to renew funding for the Department of Homeland Security.
But in doing so, Republicans exposed fresh rifts in their expanded ranks as more than two dozen members, mostly from suburban districts in swing states, voted against plans to end a program granting temporary legal status to hundreds of thousands of “dreamers” — or children brought to the country illegally by their parents who have served as the emotional centerpiece of the years-long debate.
House approval of the spending bill is just the opening act in a debate expected to stretch into late February, when homeland security expires. Legal challenges to Obama’s immigration orders, led by Republican state attorneys general, are underway. A senior GOP lawmaker suggested Wednesday that House and Senate leaders might also file suit.
The bill passed 236 to 191 with the support of two moderate Democrats. But 10 Republicans voted against the final bill. Earlier, 26 Republicans — including several new members from suburban districts around Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami and Philadelphia — joined Democrats in voting against a proposal to end Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), a veteran Miami Republican who was among those to vote against the bill and the DACA amendment, said that his party won't be able to settle the immigration fight until it negotiates a bipartisan compromise with Obama.
“Regardless of what happens this week, this month, on this issue, it will not make the issue itself go away,” he said.
But Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.) said he was encouraged by the strong support the bill received from fellow Republicans. He was lead author of an amendment that would effectively invalidate the executive actions taken by Obama in November and his policy instructing federal immigration officers to focus their efforts on deporting illegal immigrants with criminal backgrounds. The amendment passed with GOP support.
“It was a strong vote. I think it sends a message to the Senate as it goes forward. And we're optimistic about it,” he said.
In the wake of terrorist attacks in France last week, Republicans have faced criticism from Obama and congressional Democrats for delaying swift passage of new security funding. Some party leaders and operatives also worry that the aggressive nature of the bill will once again spoil GOP attempts to appeal to Hispanic and Asian voters in the 2016 president election. But GOP congressional leaders have said that the legislation is designed only to respond to Obama's ""executive overreach.""
""We do not take this action lightly, but there is simply no alternative,"" Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said ahead of the vote as he recounted the 22 times he said Obama has raised doubts about his ability to change immigration policy through presidential powers. ""Enough is enough,"" he added later.
The White House denounced the House vote, saying Republicans were putting homeland security funding, training and long-range planning at risk. Obama’s top domestic policy adviser, Cecilia Muñoz, reiterated Obama’s threatened veto.
The House GOP “is interested in debating immigration but only interested in debating it if they undo the most significant and constructive actions that have taken place in many years,” she said in a conference call with reporters. Republicans are doing nothing on immigration that would “move the country forward.”
Gil Kerlikowske, the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said Obama’s executive actions are aimed at allowing the department to focus resources on deporting illegal immigrants who have committed felonies or have terrorist ties, rather than those who are living in the country illegally but do not break other laws.
“Prioritization is critical for any law enforcement agency,” he said.
While 218 Republicans voted for the amendment ending DACA, the ""no"" votes came from newly-elected Reps. Bob Dold (R-Ill.) from the Chicago suburbs; Cresent Hardy (R-Nev.) from the Las Vegas suburbs; Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) and Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) from the Philadelphia suburbs; Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), who represents a Miami-area district; Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), who won her election by fewer than 200 votes; and Rep. John Katko (R-N.Y.) from an Upstate New York district that has switched parties several times in recent years.
They were joined by senior Republicans in their state delegations, including Florida's Mario Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen; Adam Kinzinger of Illinois; New Jersey's Chris Smith and Frank LoBiondo; New York's Chris Gibson, Richard Hanna and Peter King; Pennsylvania's Patrick Meehan and Charlie Dent; and Nevada's Mark Amodei and Joe Heck. Other members, including Reps. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.), Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), David Valadao (R-Calif.), Fred Upton (R-Mich.) and Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), also voted no.
In the Senate, Republicans control 54 seats, but 60 votes will be needed to advance the bill, and no Democratic senator has expressed support for it. The impasse means Republican leaders will need to negotiate a watered-down bill that can earn Democrat support, pass the Senate and be sent back to the House before current homeland security funding expires on Feb. 27.
If Republicans fail to block Obama's immigration policies through legislation, House and Senate leaders may team up on a new federal lawsuit challenging him, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said Wednesday. Noting that several states are now challenging Obama's immigration actions in court, he said a similar suit might be brought by GOP lawmakers in the House and Senate.
""No decision has been made about that,"" he said, at a reporter breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor, adding that it's likely to be the subject of talks at a two-day GOP policy retreat that begins Thursday at a conference center in Hershey, Pa.
""Congress has the right to write the laws and appropriate funds to programs under Article I of the Constitution, and if we are successful in using that legislation and make it clear that there is no legal authority for the president’s actions, then we don’t need to get to litigation,"" he added.

4605,"US House, Barack Obama, White House, Boehner, GOP'",Vox,12/4/2014,,,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/4/7335189/republican-immigration-plan,"The House of Representatives has passed a bill that would stop President Obama from letting millions of unauthorized immigrants apply for protection from deportation. The bill passed 216-197, with seven Republicans voting against it (and three Democrats voting in favor). The bill is almost certainly not going to become law. Democrats won't bring it up in the Senate before the end of this Congress, at the end of the month. Republicans may bring the bill up again next year, when they control both chambers of Congress. But the administration has already promised to veto it, and Republicans won't have large enough majorities to override the veto. The bill might also end the US' current policy toward Cuban immigration, which allows for essentially unlimited migration to the US.
What would the bill actually do?
The bill the House just passed would ban the Department of Homeland Security from giving relief from deportation, or work permits, to any ""category"" of immigrants who are here unlawfully, or who come unlawfully. The government could still issue protections from deportation — but they would have to be on a case-by-case basis.
according to the administration, the bill wouldn't ban anything the president is actually doing
Republicans believe that this would prevent President Obama from implementing the executive actions he announced last month, which would allow about three and a half million unauthorized immigrants to apply for protection from deportation and work permits. But here's the problem for Republicans: the Obama administration maintains that its new program is ""case-by-case,"" not categorical. So according to the administration, even if the bill somehow passed into law — which it's extremely unlikely to do — it wouldn't actually ban anything the president is actually doing.
Are Republicans trying to take away protections from unauthorized immigrants who've already gotten them?
There are over 600,000 unauthorized immigrants who've already gotten temporary protection from deportation and work permits thanks to the Obama administration. They applied under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was introduced in 2012.
The bill the House just passed isn't retroactive — it would only apply to immigrants who sought protection from deportation after November 20. So it wouldn't take protection away from the immigrants who've already been protected by DACA (or immigrants whose DACA applications have been submitted, but not approved yet).
But DACA only lasts for two years, and the bill would prohibit immigrants from getting their DACA protections renewed. So as DACA grants run out over the next two years, those immigrants would, one by one, become vulnerable to deportation again.
Would the bill just apply to President Obama's policies?
The bill is pretty broad, and it could definitely apply to some longer-standing policies as well. Most notably, it's possible that banning ""categorical"" relief would end the ""wet foot, dry foot"" policy that allows Cuban defectors to stay in the US. House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte said that the bill wouldn't affect Cubans, because there's an existing law that allows all Cubans to get relief in the US — but the text of the bill itself doesn't actually carve out an exception for existing law.
Republicans have historically been staunch defenders of ""wet foot, dry foot,"" so it's notable that they weren't more explicit in carving out an exception.
Did any Republicans think this was a bad idea?
Seven Republicans voted against the bill. Five of them are pro-immigration or moderate Republicans, who've voted against previous attempts to expand deportation. The other two (Rep. Louie Gohmert and Rep. Marlin Stutzman) are hard-liners, who voted against the bill because it didn't go far enough. Three other House conservatives (including leading immigration hawk Steve King) voted ""present,"" for the same reason.
What more can Republicans do to try to stop the president's immigration actions?
Republicans are still figuring out whether they want to try to defund the Department of Homeland Security unless the president ends the new relief program. Speaker of the House John Boehner has floated the idea of passing a bill now that would only fund DHS for a few months (while the rest of the government was funded through fall 2015), so that Congress could decide what to do in the spring. But some conservatives want to pass a bill that would restrict DHS from getting any money now, unless the president agreed to end the program."
6444,"House rebukes Obama over immigration actions, spending fight looms'",Fox News (Online),12/4/2014,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/12/04/house-approves-rebuke-obama-immigration-actions-spending-fight-looms/,"House Republicans voted Thursday to block President Obama's immigration executive actions, though it was unclear whether the largely symbolic step would be enough to prevent a risky budget stand-off next week.
The House voted 219-197 for the bill, by Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla., that declares Obama's actions ""null and void and without legal effect.""
The legislation is part of a three-step plan by House GOP leaders to both address Obama's immigration maneuvers and approve a new spending bill to avert a partial government shutdown. Next week, the chamber is set to vote on a bill funding most of the government through fiscal 2015, and the Department of Homeland Security through early next year. That would tee up a new fight over funding for Obama's immigration policies when Republicans control both chambers.
However, many conservative lawmakers want to wage that battle now, and use the looming Dec. 11 deadline -- when current government funding expires -- as leverage to defund the immigration plan.
They worry Yoho's legislation is an ineffective tool for doing that, as the stand-alone bill approved Thursday stands little chance of passing the Senate. The White House also has issued a veto threat, calling the bill ""non-sensical.""
""I'm not happy,"" Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., said. He said he's concerned that if Republicans don't fight the immigration policy now, it could send the wrong signal ahead of the new Congress.
Conservative sources indicate there are between 30 and 40, or more, conservatives who would bolt on any spending bill next week.
""There's a higher risk of more [members] bolting,"" said one source. ""Let us sort of vent. I don't think [GOP leaders] thought this was going to be as big an issue.""
But despite that concern, one source said GOP leaders think would-be defectors will come back to favor the plan at the end.
Asked if he was concerned that opposition could torpedo the spending bill, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky., said: ""I don't think so. I'm hearing good things about it.""
Still, House Speaker John Boehner might need Democratic support to carry the spending package across the finish line next week.
House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who had been coy about whether she'd help pass a spending plan, said Thursday she's reached out to Boehner to extend a ""hand of friendship"" to keep the government open -- as long as Democrats see a bill they can support.
It's unclear whether the legislation in the works meets that criteria. She indicated Thursday that Democrats might make demands if Boehner needs their help.
""If he has 218 votes, there's no conversation. If he doesn't, we have leverage,"" Pelosi said.
At a press conference earlier Thursday, Boehner urged his rank-and-file to be patient, making the case for delaying the immigration fight until next year.
""Come January, we'll have a Republican House and Republican Senate, and we'll be in a stronger position to take actions,"" he said.
Boehner said the current plan is ""the most practical way to fight the president's action.""
Obama's executive actions would defer deportations and grant work permits to up to 5 million illegal immigrants.

House GOP leaders formally blocked a pair of immigration measures from getting a vote on a critical defense policy bill early Wednesday, dealing another blow to the prospects of legislation to rewrite the immigration system this year.
The Republican-led House Rules Committee, which hews closely to the wishes of leadership, declined to include legislation written by Rep. Jeff Denham (R-Calif.) — giving a path to green cards for immigrants who came here as children if they serve in the military – among the amendments that will get a vote on the National Defense Authorization Act.

“I am disappointed that my ENLIST amendment was not ruled in order this year,” Denham said Wednesday. “I will continue to push for a vote on the stand-alone bill so that undocumented young people who want to perform the ultimate act of patriotism will have that opportunity and be able to earn legal status through their sacrifice.”

Another immigration measure, from Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas), that would allow young immigrants who have been granted a reprieve from deportations by the Obama administration to enroll in U.S. military academies was also blocked from a vote.
“I’m disappointed that expanding opportunity to all of our students to the U.S. military academies is not allowed to be part of the discussion about our nation’s defense readiness,” Castro said in a statement Wednesday. He plans to introduce the measure as a standalone bill with Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.).
Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said Tuesday that including Denham’s legislation, called the ENLIST Act, on a must-pass bill such as the NDAA was “inappropriate,” although he noted that Republican leaders have supported the measure in the past. Boehner added that there are talks about allowing the bill to get a stand-alone vote on the House floor.
More than 300 amendments were filed to the NDAA, and 162 of them will be considered on the legislation – a sweeping annual measure that sets policy for the Pentagon."
3488,"Simple Common Sense': Jeh Johnson Defends Executive Action on Immigration""",NBC News (Online),12/2/2014,,,http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/simple-common-sense-jeh-johnson-defends-executive-action-immigration-n259736,"Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.
Immigration took center stage on Capitol Hill as the legislative bodies reconvened for the final stretch of the Congressional year.
In the first of two hearings Tuesday focusing on President Barack Obama's executive action, Homeland Security chief Jeh Johnson defended the Obama administration’s decision to grant deportation relief to some undocumented immigrants as “simple common sense,” even as GOP lawmakers pilloried the policy as a dangerous power grab.
“The reality is that, given our limited resources, these people are not -- and have not been for years -- prioritizes for removal,” Johnson said in testimony to the House Homeland Security Committee. “It’s time we acknowledge that and encourage them to be held accountable. This is simple common sense.”
But while Republicans emphasized that immigration reform is an important issue that must be addressed, GOP lawmakers decried the president’s action as dangerous and damaging to the balance of power in Washington.
“There’s a right way to do this, and there’s a wrong way,” said committee chairman Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas in his opening remarks. “And unfortunately, the president has done it the wrong way.”
Johnson responded by saying he's ""fully comfortable"" that the executive branch has the authority to implement the executive action.
The Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories. This site is protected by recaptcha
Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who was just tapped by his colleagues to lead the feisty Oversight and Government Reform Committee, asked Johnson if he thought the president changed the law. After Johnson said the president did not change the law, Chaeffetz played a clip of President Obama speaking in Las Vegas about his executive order where he said he ""change(d) the law.""
When Chaffetz called out Johnson for contradicting the president, Johnson said, ""Someone plays me an eight word excerpt from a broader speech, I know to be suspicious. That was very nice.""
McCaul contended that the announcement itself could cause a surge in illegal immigration. Johnson countered that specific targeting of undocumented immigrants who have recently entered the country illegally will curb any spike. He promoted the expansion of the department's detention capabilities, including a new facility in Texas, which he says will be directed at detaining people who came to the U.S. in the past year.
The executive action announced by President Barack Obama last month would relieve up to 4.1 million undocumented immigrants – including the parents of U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident children – from the threat of deportation. To become eligible for a three-year renewable relief period and work authorization, those parents will have to register, submit biometric data, pass background checks and pay fees.
Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama bemoaned the fact that eligible immigrants could potentially receive Social Security and Medicare because workers will now be paying into the system. He called it ""irresponsible"" to ""burden"" the system.
In a speech announcing the decision, Obama said that the federal government would refocus resources to prioritize the deportation of those undocumented immigrants who are threats to the nation’s security. “Felons, not families. Criminals, not children,” he said.
The clash over immigration has roiled Capitol Hill and may have complicated lawmakers' efforts to pass a bill to fund the federal government beyond a December 11 deadline.
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell ruled out the possibility of immigration forcing a government shutdown, saying Tuesday that ""there'll be no more government shutdowns.""
After a meeting with his caucus, House Speaker John Boehner offered few details on how the Republicans would proceed. He said a ""variety of options"" exist but that no decisions have been made.
“It’s a serious threat to our system of government. And frankly we have limited options and limited abilities to deal with it directly,"" Boehner noted.
Also on the Hill Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing entitled “President Obama's Executive Overreach on Immigration.""

4065,Boehner makes sales pitch to GOP',Politico,12/2/2014,,,http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/boehner-makes-sales-pitch-to-gop-113246.html,"Top House Republicans agree on a two-part plan to keep the government from closing in nine days. Now comes the hard part: selling it.
At a meeting in the basement of the Capitol Tuesday morning, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and the GOP leadership team will face rank-and-file Republicans for the first time since President Barack Obama’s executive action on immigration. They will try to convince the troops to channel their anger at a mostly symbolic immigration bill, while agreeing to a separate funding package that would keep most of the government open for nine months, while funding immigration enforcement agencies for just a few months.
Advertisement
The meeting is the first big test of whether Boehner, Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Steve Scalise (R-La.) can accomplish what they have promised since a sweeping election victory this fall — that they can move beyond the days of ruling by crisis and prove they can govern responsibly.
( Also on POLITICO: House to vote on immigration action, avoid shutdown)
By Monday night, leaders were beginning to gauge whether their colleagues would support a bill introduced by Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) that states the executive branch does not have the power to exempt some people from immigration laws — a direct affront to Obama’s moves. The Florida Republican’s bill is expected to garner widespread support in the House conference and give GOP lawmakers an outlet to vent some of their frustrations with Obama. The Senate is not likely to take up the measure.
Boehner and other GOP leaders hope that by allowing them to vote for the Yoho bill they can get enough support from the rank and file to move forward with a funding deal, which will keep nearly all the government open until September 2015, while funding immigration enforcement agencies on a short-term basis.
It won’t be an easy task. Not only is Boehner weighing the desires of his own rambunctious conference, his moves are part of a larger game of three-level chess with power centers on K Street, across Capitol Hill and in the White House competing to move their agenda forward in the next week and a half. Boehner and his allies say he has been hobbled by the White House, which unveiled a controversial proposal before government funding was set to expire.
The most pressing item Boehner has to deal with is the government-funding fight. The GOP leadership plans to move forward with a plan at some point next week.
( Also on POLITICO: House and Senate GOP to hold joint retreat)
Some aides and lawmakers in the leadership think that the anger about the executive action is overstated, and Boehner and McCarthy (R-Calif.) will be able to credibly make the case that Yoho’s bill is a good option. And, leadership will argue that if the Senate ignores the language, they can return to the fight in early 2015.
Others are less sanguine, and have been exploring options such as a split government funding bill, a short-term bill, language to prevent Obama from using government-collected fees to implement his policies and a lawsuit. Some have advocated action on a series of small-bore immigration bills. If all other options fail, Congress is poised to create another cliff in the first quarter of 2015 by passing a short-term funding bill.
At the same time, House Republican leadership is privately plotting how to move a yearlong extension of business-friendly tax breaks. GOP leders began gauging support Monday, and were studying the calendar so the Senate has enough time to vote. A bill could come to the floor by Wednesday.
This flood of action is unexpected and unwanted. Boehner and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wanted to have a quiet lame-duck session, where the leadership simply cleared legislation and potential funding cliffs to have a productive first quarter. But now, these fights are shifting to the beginning of 2015, throwing them into the mix with a new Republican majority that will be beginning to jell, and a presidential nominating contest that will be starting.
( Also on POLITICO: The new GOP divide)
Some of this is Congress’s fault, but leaders on Capitol Hill blame the president. The government funding debate was designed to be simple — the House Republicans and Senate Democrats had all but agreed on a yearlong spending bill until the executive order on immigration was issued. That also blew up tax extender deal, which was negotiated by House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp of Michigan, Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden of Oregon and Reid.
One former Republican tax aide was pessimistic that Congress and the White House could come to a deal for a bigger extension package.“How do you put Humpty Dumpty back together again given the terms of the original agreement have been widely discussed?”
While the leadership struggles to coalesce, K Street is growing restless — putting enormous pressure on key allies to act. The short-term bill that Congress is settling on is a worst-case scenario for business. One tax lobbyist said there was widespread frustration with the White House for “torpedoing” a deal and called it “sobering” that Congress would likely do the bare minimum before leaving.
K Street, meanwhile, has been flooding Capitol Hill trying to gather intelligence and meet with key aides to push lawmakers to aim for a longer-term tax deal. Powerful industries ranging from manufacturing, to high tech, to wind energy, business groups like the Business Roundtable and U.S. Chamber of Commerce have all been pressing their case.
( POLITICO Magazine: The Gunfight in Cyberspace)
“It’s all hands on deck just to get them to act to get something done and not allow this Congress to leave without renewing them,” said Rich Gold, the head of Holland & Knight’s government affairs practice, of tax extenders.
“I think that part of the frustration is that you are talking about immediate economic consequences,” Information Technology Industry Council’s Andy Halataei said. “To the degree that a one-year extension really only applies to 2014, it would be much better than Congress just adjourning, but it still doesn’t speak to the certainty that we need to plan and to remain competitive in a global marketplace.”
Not taking any action would be a disaster for corporations looking to plan for the next year. It would be nearly unprecedented for Congress to leave without passing a one-year extension.
“If they don’t extend these, it’s a tax increase on all those companies that are affected,” said Dorothy Coleman, head of tax policy for the National Association of Manufacturers."

Chairman of the Committee Bob Goodlatte made an appearance last night on The Kelly File to preview the hearing, saying Obama's executive amnesty ""has got to be one of the largest unconstitutional power grabs by any president ever.""
Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com
The witness list for today's hearing includes Dale E. Fowler School of Law Professor Ronald Rotunda, American Center for Law and Justice Chief Counsel Jay Sekulow, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher Partner Thomas H. Dupree Jr. and National Immigration Law Center Executive Director Marielena Hincapi.
""Whether framed as an executive order or as mere “executive action” in the form of so-called “prosecutorial discretion,” President Obama’s recent action on immigration violates the Constitution. It is moored neither in his authority granted by the Constitution nor in authority delegated by a lawful statute passed by Congress. First, by contradicting Congress’s express and implied intent, President Obama’s actions violate the test articulated in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer. Second, by enacting a sweeping new program under the guise of “prosecutorial discretion,” President Obama has violated controlling precedent and defied clear instructions from
his own attorneys at the Office of Legal Counsel,"" Sekulow argues in prepared testimony.
Last week the Congressional Research Service determined Congress does in fact have the power to defund President Obama's executive amnesty action, despite the agency being used to fulfill the action being funded almost entirely by fees.
In light of Congress's constitutional power over the purse, the Supreme Court has recognized that ""Congress may always circumscribe agency discretion to allocate resources by putting restrictions in the operative statutes."" Where Congress has done so, ""an agency is not free simply to disregard statutory responsibilities. Therefore, if a statute were enacted which prohibited appropriated funds from being used for some specified purposes, then the relevant funds would be unavailable to be obligated or expended for those purposes.
A fee-funded agency or activity typically refers to one in which the amounts appropriated by Congress for that agency or activity are derived from fees collected from some external source. Importantly, amounts received as fees by federal agencies must still be appropriated by Congress to that agency in order to be available for obligation or expenditure by the agency. In some cases, this appropriation is provided through the annual appropriations process. In other instances, it is an appropriation that has been enacted independently of the annual appropriations process (such as a permanent appropriation in an authorizing act). In either case, the funds available to the agency through fee collections would be subject to the same potential restrictions imposed by Congress on the use of its appropriations as any other type of appropriated funds.

6808,Boehner predicts new surge of illegal immigration',Washington Times,11/21/2014,,,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/21/boehner-predicts-new-surge-illegal-immigration/,"House Speaker John A. Boehner would not say Friday what action he and his colleagues will take to push back against President Obama’s executive immigration moves, but vowed something will happen.
“The House will, in fact, act,” the Ohio Republican said at a brief morning press conference to respond to what he called a break-down in democracy stemming from Mr. Obama’s claims of unilateral powers to halt deportations and grant work permits to as many as 5 million illegal immigrants with family ties or who meet other criteria the president said make them the wrong targets for deportation.
Mr. Boehner’s House colleagues have been struggling with what options they have. Some had hoped to use the annual spending process to defund the president’s action, but on Thursday the Appropriations Committee said that was a fruitless avenue.
Mr. Boehner said he believes Congress should still work on immigration, but said Mr. Obama’s moves signaled he “has chosen to deliberately sabotage any chance of enacting bipartisan reforms.”
The speaker also predicted another surge of illegal immigrants next year, similar to the one involving children and families from Central America this past summer, which took the Homeland Security Department by surprise and sent the administration scrambling to adjust.
Tens of thousands of children and families have been granted at least temporary admittance to the U.S. while they await the outcome of their cases, which could take years.
“Next summer it could be worse,” he said.

6385,"I had promised': Obama to announce executive action on immigration Thursday in primetime speech""",Fox News (Online),11/20/2014,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/11/20/obama-to-announce-executive-action-on-immigration-thursday-in-primetime-speech/,"President Obama, following through on his vow to sidestep Congress, will announce in a prime time TV speech Thursday the executive actions he will take to change U.S. immigration law.
Obama will make his announcement, expected to protect roughly 5 million illegal immigrants from deportation, from the White House at 8 p.m. EST.
The president will go ahead with his plan despite widespread opposition from Capitol Hill Republicans, who have asked him to wait until next year when the GOP controls the House and Senate to try to reform the country’s broken immigration system.
Obama is also under intense pressure from Hispanics and much of his liberal base to act now, after promising to act by September, then disappointing them by waiting until after the midterms.
Immigration lawyer Margaret Wong released a statement saying that she had been invited to the White House for a holiday party Wednesday night and that Obama had told her ""I had promised. I had promised.""
More On This...
""He was actually very proud that he's been able to keep his word,"" Wong said.
At least some of the estimated 5 million illegal immigrants who would be spared from deportation also are expected to be made eligible for work permits. But the eligible immigrants would not be entitled to federal benefits -- including health care tax credits -- under the plan, administration officials said Wednesday.
Late Wednesday, the United Farm Workers announced that Obama had told union President Arturo Rodriguez that at least 250,000 unionized farm workers would be eligible for deportation relief, with at least half that eligible number based in California.
The president in 2012 used executive action to delay deportation for some of the millions of young people brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents.
House Speaker John Boehner has warned Obama that taking executive action on the immigration issue before January would be tantamount to ""playing with fire.""
And on Wednesday, before the announcement, Boehner aide Michael Steel referred to the president as “Emperor Obama,” referring to his attempt to govern alone.
The Democrat-controlled Senate last year passed bipartisan, comprehensive immigration-reform legislation. However, the GOP-controlled House has not passed such a bill.
“We've been waiting for a year for House Republicans to come to a vote,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday. “We're confident it would pass with bipartisan support.”
He also said the president chose to act because the House has indicated it will not address immigration reform in the next Congress.
Congressional Republicans are already working on a strategy to stop Obama from using executive action, including a plan to submit a temporary spending bill that would cut any funding for related efforts -- like issuing Social Security cards for those to be protected under the Obama change.
The federal government technically runs out of money by December 11. So the president and Congress failing to promptly reach a budget deal could result in a partial government shutdown. However, Republicans have said they do not intend to submit a budget that Obama would veto and result in a shutdown.
""What I'm going to be laying out is the things that I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system better, even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem,"" Obama said in a video posted on Facebook on Wednesday.
Obama is scheduled to host a White House dinner before the speech for 18 congressional Democrats to talk about immigration and other second-term priorities, then travel to Las Vegas to tout his changes.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is expected to join the president in his home state of Nevada.
Reid said Tuesday that Obama should take executive action as quickly as possible, a shift from last week when he said the president should wait to act until Congress had completed work on the must-pass spending legislation.
""I believe that when the president decides to do his executive order, he should go big, as big as he can,"" Reid said, adding that he had spoken with Obama on Monday. ""I said he should do something as quickly as he can.""
However, other Democrats still want Obama to wait on unilateral action for fear such a move will poison spending-bill negotiations.
""I wish he would let the process work for a few months before he did this,"" said Sen. Jon Tester, D-Montana.

An additional one million people will get protection from deportation through other parts of the president’s plan to overhaul the nation’s immigration enforcement system, including the expansion of an existing program for “Dreamers,” young immigrants who came to the United States as children. There will no longer be a limit on the age of the people who qualify.
But farm workers will not receive specific protection from deportation, nor will the Dreamers’ parents. And none of the five million immigrants over all who will be given new legal protections will get government subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act.
These new details about the broad reach of Mr. Obama’s planned executive action on immigration emerged as he prepared to speak to the nation in a prime-time address on Thursday night. On Friday, the president is to travel to Las Vegas to rally public support for his plan in a state where Hispanics are a growing and politically powerful constituency."

Originally, most Democrats supposed and hoped he’d at least have the courtesy to wait until after the December Louisiana runoff between Sen. Mary Landrieu and Rep. Bill Cassidy. After all, any type of “poison-the-well” executive action before voters head to the polls would be politically devastating. But now that the Keystone XL Pipeline has gone down in flames and her cause appears to be hopeless, he might be ready to move now.
To wit, the president will be in Las Vegas on Friday, and The Hill reports everything appears to be in place:
Could President Obama’s announcement of sweeping new executive action on immigration reform be coming Friday in Las Vegas? A pair of local media outlets reported late Tuesday night that the president would be making a surprise trip to the city later this week. The Las Vegas Review Journal reported only that Obama was planning a visit, while Jon Ralston, a prominent Nevada political journalist,tweeted that he was hearing Obama would speak at Del Sol High School. A speech at Del Sol would provide a symbolic bookend on the president’s push for immigration reform. During a speech at the school in January 2013, he declared repeatedly “now is the time” for Congress to enact immigration reform. “We can't allow immigration reform to get bogged down in an endless debate,” Obama said in the speech. “We've been debating this a very long time.”
Thus the symbolism and location of the visit is unmistakable. In all likelihood, Friday will be a huge news day. Stay tuned."

President Obama said in a video that he will lay out his proposal to overhaul the nation's immigration system Thursday and will travel to Las Vegas on the heels of that announcement to rally support for his initiative on Friday.
""Tomorrow night I'm going to be announcing here from the White House some steps I can take to start fixing our broken immigration system,"" Obama said in a video posted on Facebook Wednesday afternoon.
""Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken. Unfortunately Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long,"" Obama said. ""So what' I'm going to be laying out is the things I can do with my lawful authority as president to make the system work better even as I continue to work with Congress and encourage them to get a bipartisan, comprehensive bill that can solve the entire problem.
According to a senior Democrat familiar with the plans, Obama will announce on Thursday that he is providing temporary protections to up to 5 million undocumented immigrants. His orders will make up to 4 million undocumented immigrants eligible for temporary protective status and provide relief to another 1 million through other means.
In a blow to activists advocating on behalf of young immigrant families, there will be no guaranteed protections for the parents of so-called “Dreamers,” -- children protected by Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program – nor for immigrant agricultural workers, said the Democrat, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
Congress will receive official details on the move Thursday, according to a senior Democratic Party official.
Obama said he will travel to Del Sol High School in Las Vegas Friday, where he will discuss and rally support for his plan.
Advocates began readying events to promote the administration’s immigration policy.
“We hear there will be a prime time Thursday evening announcement (to preview) and full unveiling in Vegas on Friday,” immigration advocate Dawn Le told other activists in an e-mail, which was later inadvertently sent to a group of reporters Wednesday morning. “Can folks begin to work and plan watch parties for Thursday and/or Friday? Unclear whether Thursday night content will be what is ""celebratory,"" but Friday will be where we need a lot of energy guaranteed.”
Obama launched his push for immigration reform in January 2013 in Las Vegas, outlining a plan that would allow many of the nation’s 11 million undocumented immigrants to earn citizenship.
The president's decision to speak at the city's Del Sol High School highlights the administration's intensified push to convince Latinos that the Democratic Party is committed to addressing the dilemma of millions of undocumented immigrants. Obama is preparing to use his executive authority to expand temporary protections to millions of these individuals, as well as to broaden visa programs for highly skilled technology workers and perhaps also stiffen security along the U.S.-Mexico border.
During an appearance at the National Press Club Wednesday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Obama will announce ""in the coming days ... [a] set of comprehensive reforms, within our existing legal authorities, to fix our broken immigration system.""
He did not specify the actions Obama will take but did say they will include steps to further secure the southwestern border of the United States. Administration lawyers have concluded that executive action on the issue is legal and within the president's authority, he said, despite intense opposition from Republicans.
""Legislative action is always preferable,"" Johnson said. ""But we have waited for Congress to act, and the Congress has not acted. The president has waited.""
Johnson said the administration has concluded it has ""wide latitude"" to take action. ""It can't be that we're not allowed to lift a finger to fix our broken immigration system,"" he said. ""And we will.""
Congressional Republicans have warned Obama that he risks undermining the prospects for cooperation on legislation in the final two years of his presidency if he takes action on immigration.
The decision to speak in Las Vegas could also bolster the political standing of Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who said in an interview with Univision on Tuesday that when it came to expanding protections for undocumented immigrants, ""I think it should be done now.""
Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, wrote in an e-mail that even as Obama acted on his own to break the stalemate on the issue, Republicans would still have a chance to legislate.
“While executive action is not ideal, it accomplishes four things: Stabilizes our workforce, prioritizes law enforcement, protects families and puts congressional Republicans in the driver’s seat going into 2015,"" Noorani wrote. ""They have an incredible opportunity to get credit for fixing America’s immigration system.”
With Obama likely on the verge of making an announcement, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the soon-to-be majority leader, expressed confidence Wednesday that congressional Republicans will extend funding for the federal government, which is set to expire next month, even if the president moves to overhaul the immigration system and some conservatives call for a spending showdown.
But in a sign that GOP strategy is still being formulated, McConnell did not specify the framework and length of possible funding legislation. Republican leaders in the House and Senate are still mulling a variety of options, all while hoping to avoid a politically damaging shutdown.
“We have two goals here at the end of the session: fund the government and avoid retroactive tax increases. I’m confident that we’ll do both,” McConnell said in a brief exchange at the U.S. Capitol.
Other congressional Republicans warned again that Obama risks his relationship with a GOP-controlled Capitol Hill if he acts.
“If ‘Emperor Obama’ ignores the American people and announces an amnesty plan that he himself has said over and over again exceeds his Constitutional authority, he will cement his legacy of lawlessness and ruin the chances for Congressional action on this issue -- and many others,” Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), said in an e-mail.
In an effort to cast doubts on the legality of Obama’s decision, GOP aides have been circulating a list of 22 times the president has said publicly that he doesn’t believe he has the authority to act through executive action to change immigration laws.

2557,OPINION: The Great Immigration Betrayal',New York Times (Online News),11/17/2014,,,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/opinion/sunday/ross-douthat-the-great-immigration-betrayal.html,"This argument’s logic, at once consistent and deliberately obtuse, raises one obvious question: Why stop at half? (Activists are already asking.) After all, under this theory of what counts as faithfully executing the law, all that matters is that somebody, somewhere, is being deported; anyone and everyone else can be allowed to work and stay. So the president could “temporarily” legalize 99.9 percent of illegal immigrants and direct the Border Patrol to hand out work visas to every subsequent border crosser, so long as a few thousand aliens were deported for felonies every year.
The reality is there is no agreed-upon limit to the scope of prosecutorial discretion in immigration law because no president has attempted anything remotely like what Obama is contemplating. In past cases, presidents used the powers he’s invoking to grant work permits to modest, clearly defined populations facing some obvious impediment (war, persecution, natural disaster) to returning home. None of those moves even approached this plan’s scale, none attempted to transform a major public policy debate, and none were deployed as blackmail against a Congress unwilling to work the president’s will.
And none of them had major applications outside immigration law. No defender of Obama’s proposed move has successfully explained why it wouldn’t be a model for a future president interested in unilateral rewrites of other areas of public policy (the tax code, for instance) where sweeping applications of “discretion” could achieve partisan victories by fiat. No liberal has persuasively explained how, after spending the last Republican administration complaining about presidential “signing statements,” it makes sense for the left to begin applying Cheneyite theories of executive power on domestic policy debates.
Especially debates in which the executive branch is effectively acting in direct defiance of the electoral process. This is where the administration has entered extraordinarily brazen territory, since part of its original case for taking these steps was that they supposedly serve the public will, which only yahoos and congressional Republicans oppose.
This argument was specious before; now it looks ridiculous. The election just past was not, of course, a formal referendum on the president’s proposed amnesty, but it was conducted with the promise of unilateral action in the background, and with immigration as one of the more hotly debated issues. The result was a devastating defeat for Obama and his party, and most polling on unilateral action is pretty terrible for the president."

Follow him on Twitter: @rubennavarrette. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.
(CNN) -- Like misery, failure loves company. Look at the immigration debate and how both liberals and conservatives -- and elected officials in both parties -- bungle it.
President Barack Obama has failed on immigration policy. But now that he appears to be poised to take executive action to fix some of what's broken with the country's immigration system, Republicans in Congress sound like they're about to overreact and join him in that failure.
Conservatives love to stir their flock by pushing the narrative that Obama is a staunch supporter of ""amnesty"" and that the President has always been in lockstep with immigration reform advocates.
That's fiction. It's been a rocky relationship. That's because Obama belongs to that wing of the Democratic Party that hasn't been interested in legalizing the undocumented and creating more competition in the job market for U.S. workers.
Obama broke his campaign promise to make reform a top issue and eroded trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement by expanding 100-fold the program known as Secure Communities, which ropes local police into enforcing federal immigration law. He tried to fend off critics who wanted him to slow deportations by claiming that he didn't have the power to act ""as a king,"" only to later flip-flop and do just that during his 2012 re-election campaign when he unveiled Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).
Obama deported a record 2 million people in five years, divided hundreds of thousands of families, failed to deal effectively with thousands of child refugees who streamed across the U.S.-Mexico border last summer and then broke another promise when he said he would take executive action on immigration before the midterm elections but blinked.
Now, according to news reports that look like a trial balloon from the White House, Obama might, as early as this week, take unilateral action to offer several million illegal immigrants a temporary reprieve from deportation and perhaps even give some of them work permits.
If it materializes, I'll be proved wrong. A few months ago, I said this would never happen and now it looks like it might.
Options include some common sense items: Eliminating Secure Communities; broadening DACA by eliminating restrictions on how old applicants can be and when they had to have arrived; restating that the enforcement priority should be to remove violent criminals and not housekeepers and students; and expanding visa programs for immigrant spouses of U.S. citizens.
But it's the final item on the list that could really upset the apple cart: deferred action for parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, which could result in as many as 4 million to 5 million people getting a temporary reprieve from deportation. When those undocumented college students known as DREAMers first argued for special treatment, the claim was based on the simple idea that they were brought here as children and thus didn't intentionally choose to break the law.
Fair enough. But the same thing can't be said of their parents, who did intentionally break the law. Now what? Is there a new argument?
Besides, if Obama offers deferred action to parents, it will validate what conservatives have always insisted about how the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants can be used to keep their parents from being deported.
That has never been the case. Parents get deported all the time, and their U.S.-citizen kids either go with them or stay on this side of the border and get put in foster care. Republicans have been wrong all along. Now, if he goes too far, Obama could prove them right.
If the President follows through on the proposed course of action, both sides will need to calm down.
Those on the left should hold their applause. By ending the deportation juggernaut, the President would merely be putting out a fire that he started. Besides, this is just a temporary reprieve that would require the undocumented to surrender to law enforcement officials, get fingerprinted and all the rest. And it could all be revoked by the next president.
Finally, this is not what Obama promised way back when -- that he would work aggressively with Congress to pass legislation that would permanently improve the lives of millions. This isn't reform. It's ""reform lite.""
Yet at the same time, those on the right need to rein in their scorn. In the post 9/11 era, conservatives shouldn't need a reminder of something they've been telling us for years: how sweeping can be the executive power of the president. As head of the executive branch, Obama naturally has the power to set priorities for the enforcement of immigration law.
Republicans have no trouble deflecting criticism by reminding Latino voters that Obama is in charge of deportations. So, instead of threatening the suicidal tantrums of a government shutdown or impeachment, conservatives should pipe down and let him be in charge of deportations. That doesn't just mean deciding who goes but also who stays.
Besides, Republicans like to talk tough about illegal immigration and the need to uphold the ""rule of law"" but that slogan would mean more coming from them if they didn't always run away from enforcing those laws that target the root of illegal immigration: U.S. employers who hire the undocumented, many of whom contribute to the re-election campaigns of Republican lawmakers.
What Obama has in mind isn't some kindhearted miracle or the coming of the apocalypse. It's just a legitimate exercise of the power that any president would have under the Constitution and our system of government.
I know that isn't sexy, or inspiring, or inflammatory. It won't help the parties fundraise. But it does have the advantage of being true.

4137,Report: Reid Wants Obama To Delay Immigration Executive Orders',CBS News,11/14/2014,,,http://washington.cbslocal.com/2014/11/14/report-reid-wants-obama-to-delay-immigration-executive-orders/,"WASHINGTON (CBSDC/AP) — President Barack Obama is poised to act soon to unveil a series of executive actions on immigration that will shield possibly around 5 million immigrants living in the country illegally from deportation, according to advocates in touch with the White House.
The estimate includes extending deportation protections to parents and spouses of U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have been in the country for some years. The president is also likely to expand his 2-year-old program that protects young immigrants from deportation.
Timing of the announcement is unclear, though it’s expected before the end of the year. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Obama would review final recommendations after returning from his Asia trip next week.
CNN reports that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid wants the president to delay his executive order on immigration over fears of a government shutdown.
“Things are so tense here that the Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid told our Ted Barrett that he has asked the president to hold off on an executive order on immigration, until, in the words of Reid, ‘the finances of this country are out of the way.’ Translation: do it too soon and risk a government shutdown,” CNN chief congressional correspondent Dana Bash reported.
Bash added: “The other issue at play here is that funding for the government runs out on December 11th and that is why, again, Harry Reid told our Ted Barrett that he wants the president to hold off on this executive order after that because … they don’t want to deal with the government shutdown on either side of the aisle.”
Congressional Republicans are strongly opposed to Obama’s plans, and as lawmakers returned to Capitol Hill this week following midterm elections in which the GOP retook the Senate, they vowed to oppose him.
“We’re going to fight the president tooth and nail if he continues down this path. This is the wrong way to govern. This is exactly what the American people said on Election Day they didn’t want,” House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Thursday. “And so, all the options are on the table.”
Some conservatives in the House and Senate announced plans to push for language in must-pass spending bills to block the president from acting. But other Republicans warned that such a push could result in another government shutdown like the one last year over Obama’s health care plan.
“My sense is that the vast majority of us want to do everything we can to stop it, but also want to avoid outcomes that would prove bad for the country as a whole,” said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. It wasn’t clear, though, what other options Republicans had.
Traveling in Asia, Obama said Friday Congress could simply undo his executive actions by passing comprehensive immigration legislation.
“I would advise that if in fact they want to take a different approach, rather than devote a lot of time trying to constrain my lawful actions as the chief executive of the U.S. government in charge of enforcing our immigrations laws, that they spend some time passing a bill,” he said during a news conference in Yangon, Myanmar.
The immigration advocates, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of a public announcement, said that final details of the plan remained in flux. But the White House is likely to include parents and spouses of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, stipulating that they’ve resided in the U.S. for some period of time — possibly as little as five years. That group totals around 3.8 million people, according to the Migration Policy Institute.
Although Obama is not able to grant citizenship or permanent resident green cards on his own without Congress, he can offer temporary protection from deportation along with work authorization, as he has done in the past.
Adjustments also are expected to the existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that allowed immigrants under 31 who had arrived before June 2007 to apply for a reprieve from deportation and a work permit. More than 600,000 young immigrants have been shielded from deportation to date under the program. Removing the upper age limit so that applicants don’t have to be under 31 — one option under consideration — would make an additional 200,000 people eligible.
There may also be tweaks to business visa programs to speed up visas or make more available for high-tech workers or others.
Changes are also expected on the law enforcement side, including to a controversial program called Secure Communities that hands over people booked for local crimes to federal immigration authorities. A former administration official with knowledge of the plans said the Secure Communities program would be eliminated or at least renamed, although some of the concepts would remain. Priorities for immigrants to be picked up by immigration authorities will also be revised to eliminate some of the less serious conduct that previously would have caused someone to be detained, said the former official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose private details.
In an interview on CBS’ “Face The Nation” Sunday, Obama said he would prefer to sign comprehensive immigration legislation like the bill passed last year by the Senate. But absent that, “I am going to do what I can do through executive action.” He said the Homeland Security Department is “deporting people who don’t need to be deported.”
Advocates are gearing up to embrace the long-sought changes, which Obama has delayed twice, most recently under pressure from Senate Democrats concerned about the midterm elections. At the same time they intend to keep pushing for wider protections and a legislative solution.
“This is definitely a step in the right direction and we would still encourage the administration to go even bigger than the estimated 5 million,” said Kica Matos, of the Fair Immigration Reform Movement. “This is a temporary fix and Republicans need to understand that the immigrant rights movement intends to wage a ferocious fight until we have permanent solution and that is through legislation.”

President Obama irked Republicans and his past self this week by telling CBS he would bypass Congress and use executive action on illegal immigration, potentially ordering a 10-point amnesty plan as early as next week.
The move reportedly would likely include an expansion of deferred deportation for undocumented children to their families, and Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Obama is ""nearing a final decision"" on what to do. Speaker John Boehner's, R-Ohio, office called the potential actions ""executive amnesty.""
Obama could look back on statements from his first campaign and first term about what he can and can't do as head of the Executive Branch.
""I take the Constitution very seriously,"" he told a Pennsylvania town hall in 2008. ""The biggest problems that we're facing right now have to do with George Bush trying to bring more and more power into the Executive Branch and not go through Congress at all, and that's what I intend to reverse when I'm President of the United States of America.""
In 2011, he told a Univision town hall that there ""are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system."" To ignore those congressional mandates through executive order, Obama said, would ""not conform with my appropriate role as president.""
""I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the [immigration] on my own,"" he told the National Council of La Raza that year. ""Believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting. I promise you. Not just on immigration reform. But that's not how our system works. That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written.""

GOP weighs bill to block Obama on immigration The rhetoric heats up as yet another immigration debate surfaces.
House Republicans have begun to talk about how to stop President Barack Obama from issuing an executive order changing the enforcement of immigration laws, according to multiple GOP sources.
Several options are being considered, including a standalone bill to strip or restrict funding from agencies that deal with immigration. The staffs of Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and other lawmakers involved with immigration policy are working through possibilities.

No decisions have been made, as discussions have just started. And some in the top rung of the party aren’t certain the House has the ability to stop the Obama administration from using this authority.
( Also on POLITICO: GOP votes to give John Boehner 2 more years)
Just a few days into the lame-duck session, the rhetoric is getting hotter, and the brief session of legislating has morphed into yet another immigration debate.
In a Thursday morning meeting, Boehner told House Republicans that he warned Obama not to issue an executive order, or else his agenda would be completely stymied on Capitol Hill. And in a news conference in the afternoon, Boehner said Congress would go as far as ignoring requests from the administration if Obama “goes down this path.”
“Well, you know, every administration needs this and needs that and needs all kinds of things, and you know, if he wants to go off on his own, there are things he’s just not going to get,” Boehner said, after winning his party’s nomination for another term as speaker.
“Our goal here is to stop the president from violating his own oath of office and violating the constitution. It’s not to shut down the government.”
But here’s the rub: GOP leadership has not yet coalesced around any mechanism to stop Obama. And even Boehner seemed unsure he could stop him.
“We’ll find out,” he said.
( Also on POLITICO: The best last choice)
Most importantly, House GOP leadership is very worried about their ability to fund the government if Obama issues an executive action. There is internal debate about whether Congress should fund the government for just a few months instead of nearly a full year as a mechanism to keep a tight leash on the administration. A short-term funding bill sets up another fight in 2015, and it would slow the Republican agenda on Capitol Hill. House Republican leadership doesn’t yet have a good read on the mood of the conference.
“Our goal here is to stop the president from violating his own oath of office and violating the constitution,” Boehner said, when asked about using the government funding bill to stop Obama. “It’s not to shut down the government.”
In the closed meeting Thursday morning, Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) urged leadership to pass a short-term funding bill, so a Republican Congress can fund the government in 2015. But Reps. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) and Tom Graves (R-Ga.) said the party should pass a funding bill that lasts through September — the end of the fiscal year.
( Also on POLITICO: McConnell, Reid elected to top posts in Senate)
Boehner said Republicans would fight the administration “tooth and nail.”
“This is the wrong way to govern,” Boehner said. “This is exactly what the American people said on Election Day they didn’t want and so all the options are on the table, we’re having discussions with our members and there’s no decision been made as to how we will fight this.”"
3969,Democrats blame GOP for Obama immigration delay',CNN (Web News),9/8/2014,,,http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/08/politics/immigration-delay-blame/index.html,"Story highlights Immigration reform advocates initially criticize President Obama for delaying action
Now Democrats are spreading the blame to Republicans for failing to legislate on issue
Democrats are likely trying to placate anger in immigrant communities
President Barack Obama postponed executive action on immigration, but Democrats want voters to know the delay isn't his fault.
Blame Republicans instead, according to the latest Democratic latest talking points.
Obama had weighed action on immigration -- including moves that could allow a path to legal status for millions of undocumented workers -- after congressional action on the issue stalled.
The President took the brunt of criticism immediately after the White House announced Saturday he is delaying any unitary action on immigration until after November's midterm elections.
He faced accusations of betrayal, bitter disappointment and frustration.
And those are from the President's allies -- Democrats and immigration reform proponents who lead communities that voted overwhelmingly for Obama in 2008 and 2012.

Since the weekend, Democrats began targeting House Republicans.
Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-California, said Monday on CNN's ""New Day"" that she is frustrated with the President but added: ""The real reality is that these House Republicans have refused to work with us, to move a bill that would solve this issue.""
Last year, the Senate passed a comprehensive bill that would provide a path to legal status for millions of long-term undocumented immigrants while also strengthening border security.
House Republicans refused to consider the Senate bill, which Obama and Democrats claim would pass if put to a vote.
Rep. Tony Cardenas, also a California Democrat, said the ""first blame"" should lie with Congress for not doing taking up immigration legislation.
""Now the President is forced to have to take a measure like executive actions,"" Cardenas said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union.""
The President's delayed action could protect Democrats in competitive Senate races in conservative states like Louisiana, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky and North Carolina. By focusing blame on Republicans, Democrats likely are trying to placate anger in immigrant communities.
But the relationship between those communities and the administration is strained. Immigration advocates are pointing to the 60,000 family members that could be deported before the end of the year as an unfortunate outcome of the President's political calculation.
""Republicans killed the best chance in a generation to enact landmark immigration reform legislation,"" Frank Sharry, executive director of immigration reform group America's Voice , told CNN in a statement.
""President Obama, however, has deported more than 2 million people and failed to deliver on promises of reform, including most recently when he publicly promised to take executive action by the end of the summer.""
There's no question, Republicans are still blaming the President."
5183,"Obama blames border crisis for immigration inaction, after blasting GOP for doing the same'",Fox News (Online),9/8/2014,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/09/08/obama-blames-border-crisis-for-immigration-inaction-after-blasting-gop-for/,"President Obama appears to be straddling both sides of the rhetorical border as he tries to explain why he's pushing off executive action on immigration until after the November elections.
Obama, speaking June 30 in the Rose Garden, initially said he planned to use executive action and pointed to the border crisis as a reason to act -- blasting Republicans for using the surge of illegal immigrant kids as an ""excuse to do nothing.""
""Their argument seems to be that because the system is broken, we shouldn't make an effort to fix it. ... It's just politics, plain and simple,"" Obama said at the time. The president said the humanitarian crisis ""only underscores the need to drop the politics and fix our immigration system once and for all.""
But now Democrats and Republicans alike say the president is the one who's playing politics, by pushing off executive action until after the midterms.
And the president, this time, is the one citing the border crisis as the reason to wait.
In an interview over the weekend with NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Obama said the surge has gotten “a lot of attention” and suggested that, even though the number of unaccompanied minors crossing the U.S.-Mexico border is dropping, “that’s not what the impression is on people's minds.”
Obama said he wants to “make sure that it's sustainable” when he does take action and suggested that would not be the case now.
“It's going to be more sustainable and more effective if the public understands what the facts are on immigration, what we've done on unaccompanied children and why it's necessary,” the president said. “The truth of the matter is that the politics did shift midsummer because of that problem. I want to spend some time, even as we're getting all our ducks in a row for the executive action … to make sure that the public understands why we're doing this.”
The president flatly denied that the real reason he’s waiting is he wants to protect vulnerable Democrats facing tough Senate reelection battles.
His critics aren’t buying it.
Immigrant advocates – who want imminent action from the president – as well as Republicans – who want him to scrap plans to take executive action entirely – both blasted the president for the move.
“I think it's totally politically calculated,” House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, told “Fox News Sunday.” “He’s made this determination that if he gets out in front on this issue, it will hurt seven to eight Senate races and he could potentially lose the Senate. I think Harry Reid has sent that message clearly to the president, which is why I think you've seen him back off of this position.”
McCaul called the decision “raw politics.”
Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, called it “simply a political move.”
Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., one of the biggest proponents for immigration action, complained on ABC’s “This Week” that the president was “playing it safe” and “walking away from our values and our principles.”
Gutierrez is among those calling for a massive unilateral reprieve for illegal immigrants currently in the country, something Republicans adamantly oppose.
When the idea was discussed over the summer, Republicans argued such a reprieve would only exacerbate the problem of illegal immigrant minors trekking up from Central America and into the United States.
Obama, in confirming he would push off a decision, made clear he still intends to act if Congress will not pass a comprehensive bill on its own.
“I want to make sure we get it right,” he clarified."
4357,Political Shift Stalls Efforts to Overhaul Immigration',New York Times (Online News),9/8/2014,,,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/us/politics/political-shift-stalls-obamas-efforts-to-overhaul-immigration.html,"“The truth of the matter is that the politics did shift midsummer because of that problem,” Mr. Obama said in an interview aired Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” referring to the surge of Central Americans, including thousands of unaccompanied children, across the border.
“I want to spend some time, even as we’re getting all our ducks in a row for the executive action, I also want to make sure that the public understands why we’re doing this, why it’s the right thing for the American people, why it’s the right thing for the American economy,” he said.
In the meantime, Mr. Obama has earned bitter outrage from Latinos, who make up one of his party’s strongest political constituencies. Already angered by the president’s move during his first term to accelerate deportations, activists have called the delay of promised executive action a betrayal.
“Given the string of broken promises from this president to the Latino community on immigration, there is a real question as to whether he will follow through,” said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, an immigrant-rights group. “There are important segments of the Latino community, particularly Latino immigrant voters, where there’s a sense that the Republicans hate us, and the Democrats like us, but they don’t fully respect us yet — and I think that will have to be overcome going forward.”
Angela M. Kelley, vice president for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, said Latinos — like an aggrieved girlfriend who has waited in vain for a marriage proposal — are going to expect Mr. Obama to take even more expansive executive action later this year, given the delay.
“A guy says he’s going to propose, and then he decides he’s going to delay and not propose for a couple of months, so you go, ‘O.K., I want a two-carat ring now instead of a one-carat ring,’ ” Ms. Kelley said. “The cost is high for what he’s done in terms of a delay. He’s asking the community to pay now, and to some extent, he’ll have to pay later.”
It took about one month for Mr. Obama’s promise to begin crumbling. By early August, the start of Congress’ summer break, Representative Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, had released an attack ad charging that Senator Mark Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas — one of his party’s most at-risk candidates in November’s midterm congressional elections — was ignoring an immigration crisis on the United States-Mexico border, where thousands of Central American migrants were streaming into the United States."
2585,Obama to reportedly delay executive action on immigration until after elections',Fox News (Online),9/6/2014,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/09/06/obama-to-reportedly-delay-any-executive-action-on-immigration-until-after/,"President Obama has abandoned his pledge to reform U.S. immigration policy by the end of summer and will instead wait until after the November congressional elections.
Obama concluded that using executive action to circumvent Congress during the campaign season would politicize the issue and hurt future efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform.
The decision is welcome news for Democratic senators trying to win reelection in conservative states -- and help their party fend off a strong GOP effort to take control of the upper chamber.
However, the delay is also a setback for immigration reform advocates, including Big Business and liberals.
In an interview set to air Sunday on NBC's ""Meet The Press,"" Obama admitted that politics had played a role in his decision, claiming that a partisan fight this summer over how to deal with an influx of unaccompanied minors at the southern border had created the impression of crisis.
""The truth of the matter is -- is that the politics did shift midsummer because of that problem,"" he said. ""I want to spend some time, even as we're getting all our ducks in a row for the executive action, I also want to make sure that the public understands why we're doing this, why it's the right thing for the American people, why it's the right thing for the American economy.""
Two White House officials told the Associated Press, on the condition of anonymity, that Obama made his decision Friday as he returned to Washington from a NATO summit in Wales.
They said Obama called a few allies from Air Force One and informed them of his decision, and that the president made more calls from the White House on Saturday.
The officials said Obama had no specific timeline to act, but that he still would take his executive steps before the end of the year.
In a Rose Garden speech on June 30, Obama said he had directed Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder to give him recommendations for executive action by the end of summer. Obama also pledged to ""adopt those recommendations without further delay.""
Many conservatives and other Obama critics thought Obama would act while Congress was on August break.
But White House aides repeated said in the weeks before Labor Day, the unofficial end of summer, the recommendations were still forthcoming, which created speculation that Obama was waiting until Sept. 21, the official end of summer.
Obama faced competing pressures from immigration advocacy groups that wanted prompt action and from Democrats worried that acting now would energize Republican opposition against vulnerable Senate Democrats. Among those considered most at risk were Democratic Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Kay Hagan of North Carolina.
Republicans need to win a net total of six seats to take control of the Senate.
Obama advisers were not convinced that any presidential action would affect the elections. But the officials said the discussions around the timing grew more pronounced within the past few weeks.
Ultimately, the advisers drew a lesson from 1994 when Democratic losses were blamed on votes for gun control legislation, undermining any interest in passing future gun measures.
White House officials said aides realized that if Obama's immigration action was deemed responsible for Democratic losses this year, it could hurt any attempt to pass a broad overhaul later.
The Democrat-controlled Senate has passed comprehensive immigration-reform legislation, largely on what to do about the roughly 11 million people now living illegally in the United States.
However, the Republican-control House has delayed such a vote, in large part over concerns about first securing the southern U.S. border and that a path to citizenship would be perceived as granting amnesty.
House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, informed Obama earlier this year that the chamber would not act in 2014. That led Obama to declare he would act on his own.
In recent months, partisan fighting erupted over how to address the increased flow of unaccompanied minors from Central America at the U.S. border with Mexico. The officials said the White House had not envisioned such a battle when Obama made his pledge June 30.
Obama asked for $3.7 billion to address the border crisis. The House, however, passed a measure that gave Obama only a fraction of what he sought and made it easier to deport the young migrants arriving at the border, a provision opposed by Democrats and immigration advocates. In the end, Congress adjourned without a final bill.
The number of minors caught alone illegally crossing the Mexican border into the United States has been declining since June. That decrease and Congress' absence from Washington during August has taken attention away from the border for now.
Still, the dispute over how to deal with the surge of Central American border crossers threatened to spill over into the larger debate over immigration and the fate of the millions of immigrants in the United States who either entered illegally or overstayed their visas and have been in the U.S. for some time.
During a news conference Friday in Wales, Obama reiterated his determination to act on his own even as he avoided making a commitment on timing. He also spelled out ambitious objectives for his executive actions.
Obama said that without legislation from Congress, he would take steps to increase border security, upgrade the processing of border crossers and encourage legal immigration. He also said he would offer immigrants who have been illegally in the United States for some time a way to become legal residents, pay taxes, pay a fine and learn English.
""I want to be very clear: My intention is, in the absence of ... action by Congress, I'm going to do what I can do within the legal constraints of my office, because it's the right thing to do for the country,"" he said.
The extent of Obama's authority is a matter of debate among legal experts and in Congress. Some Democrats say it would be best for Obama to let Congress act.
But pro-immigrant groups called on Obama to stick to his end-of-summer deadline, and weighed in with a strongly worded appeal to him on Friday.
""Being a leader requires making difficult and courageous decisions,"" said the letter, whose signers included the National Council of La Raza and the League of United Latin American Citizens. ""It is your time to lead, Mr. President.""

6625,President Barack Obama punts on immigration until after election',Politico,9/6/2014,,,http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/obama-punts-on-immigration-110661.html,"Obama will delay plans to issue an executive order to address immigration reform. Obama punts on immigration
President Barack Obama will delay plans to issue an executive order on immigration until the end of the year, heeding the warnings of Democratic senators who feared a voter backlash ahead of the November elections.
The decision is a major reversal from June, when the president stood in the Rose Garden and pledged to make fixes to the immigration system by the end of the summer. The delay reflected growing Democratic concerns that a sweeping executive order would further endanger the Senate majority.

“The president wants to do this in a way that is sustainable for the long-term, that is most effective and good for the country,” a White House official said in a statement Saturday. “The reality the president has had to weigh is that we’re in the midst of the political season, and because of the Republicans’ extreme politicization of this issue, the president believes it would be harmful to the policy itself and to the long-term prospects for comprehensive immigration reform to announce administrative action before the elections.”

The announcement was not a surprise to those who have watched the process closely, particularly in the last week as the White House publicly backed away from his September deadline and as more Senate Democrats called on the president to delay issuing an executive order.
But the decision could be very consequential for Obama, renewing anger among Hispanic voters and raising broader questions about the president’s handling of the issue throughout his presidency. Democrats viewed immigration reform as a slam dunk, both legislatively and politically, following the 2012 election. Two years later, Democrats are deeply divided over their strategy on the issue.
Obama is expected to discuss his decision during an interview airing Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” a White House official said Saturday.

The White House began informing Capitol Hill, immigrant advocates and other outside interest groups last night, only hours after Obama told reporters he would use a return flight from the NATO summit in Wales to study his options.
“The president has had many conversations and consultations throughout this process — including with his Cabinet, members of Congress, stakeholders, and advocates on this issue,” the White House official said. “The president is confident in his authority to act, and he will before the end of the year. But again, nothing will replace Congress acting on comprehensive immigration reform and the president will keep pressing Congress to act.”
Just a few months ago, immigration reform seemed like a political winner for the White House on multiple fronts.

It was a high-profile way for Obama to illustrate a Congress unwilling to act, driving him to find solutions without them. And for the midterms, it was going to be the president’s way of boosting Democratic turnout among both Latinos, labor and a wider progressive base that’s increasingly identified immigration reform as a top cause. Voters who turn against Democrats by Obama acting were likely already motivated Republican voters anyway, went the thinking.
And there were several key states where that turnout, particularly among Latinos, seemed like it could be a factor in a win, including Sen. Mark Udall’s re-election bid in Colorado, the Senate bids of Bruce Braley in Iowa and Michelle Nunn in Georgia, along with House races across the country.
But even as the White House said that the Department of Homeland Security, and not politics, would guide the decision, conversations with endangered Democrats began almost immediately. The resistance came from expected spots, like Sen. Mark Pryor in Arkansas, but in recent days, even from people like reliably liberal Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota, running in a race that he’s tried to keep from becoming competitive.
White House officials had been locked in an intense debate over whether Obama should announce a program to defer deportations for millions of undocumented immigrants before Election Day — aware that whichever choice they make could be tagged as the reason that Democrats lost the Senate.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid issued a statement Saturday blaming House Republicans for failing to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation and endorsing Obama’s desire to act without Congress, but didn’t say when that action should be.
“The president has made clear that while nothing replaces Congress acting on comprehensive immigration reform, given the House Republicans’ refusal to act for over a year, he will use his executive authority to take significant steps to reform our broken immigration system,” Reid said. “I know that the president is determined to act, and when he does I support a broad use of his authority to fix as much of our broken immigration system as he can through executive action.”
The reaction from the progressive base, meanwhile, was harsh.
“In a breathtakingly harsh and short sighted political miscalculation, immigrant families were sacrificed today,” said Deepak Bhargava of the Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM). “Make no mistake – this delay will have tragic consequences for the fathers, mothers, sons and daughters who will be ripped from one another’s arms in the coming weeks and months. A delay of weeks may not seem like a lot to a politician in DC, but it is everything to a child who will lose his or her parents in that time.”
The leaders of the Service Employees International Union issued a statement that they “are deeply disappointed but not paralyzed.”
Others said the delay only further raises the expectations for the executive order that Obama has promised to deliver by the end of the year.
“There is going to be a lot of skepticism about whether he will actually do it,” said Angela Kelley, an immigration strategist at the Center for American Progress. “He will have to present a pretty strong, convincing case that the issue isn’t going to be left at the altar yet again.”
For his part, House Speaker John Boehner — who opposes an Obama executive order on immigration — criticized Saturday’s announcement.
“There is a never a ‘right’ time for the president to declare amnesty by executive action,” Boehner said in a statement, “but the decision to simply delay this deeply-controversial and possibly unconstitutional unilateral action until after the election — instead of abandoning the idea altogether — smacks of raw politics. The American people deserve honesty, transparency, and accountability — and any unilateral action will only further strain the bonds of trust between the White House and the people they are supposed to serve.”"
2060,"Obama Delays Immigration Action, Yielding to Democratic Concerns'",New York Times (Online News),9/6/2014,,,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/us/politics/obama-said-to-delay-executive-action-on-immigration.html,"Senator Lamar Alexander Tennessee, said, “The founders of our country did not want a king, and the American people do not want a president who acts like one.” He called Mr. Obama’s decision a “shameful presidential trick.”
The delay also is angering Hispanic activists who have been pressing Mr. Obama for months to sidestep Congress. Leaders of several immigration groups said their members would be furious with the president for raising — and then dashing — their hopes. They criticized Mr. Obama for the delay, saying it breaks a solemn pledge to immigrants.
Arturo Carmona, the executive director of Presente.org, called the decision “a betrayal” of the Latino community and “shameful.” He said the president “is once again demonstrating that for him, politics come before the lives of Latino and immigrant families.”
And Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, said: “Today, we are deeply disheartened that the dreams of hard-working immigrant families who have long contributed to the fabric of the American life remain in jeopardy. The White House’s decision to delay executive action forces countless families to continue to wait in the shadows of fear.”
The president’s decision on Saturday underscores the difficulties of his broader pledge to use the powers of his office to govern in the face of a gridlocked Congress. Those efforts have already sparked a Republican lawsuit alleging that the president has abused his authority and is building an “imperial presidency.” And he has faced intense political pressure from his Democratic allies to delay such actions.
The timing of an announcement had developed into a serious political problem for the president. By saying he would act on his own, Mr. Obama heightened expectations among Hispanics that he would finally address the deportation fears of 11 million illegal immigrants, many of whom have been in the United States for decades and have been law-abiding members of their communities.
Since Mr. Obama took office, his administration has significantly increased the number of deportations, especially along the border with Mexico. Immigration advocates have complained that families are being torn apart when parents or children who are in the country illegally are arrested and sent home."
4260,House moves toward vote on border deal',Politico,8/1/2014,,,http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/house-gop-border-bill-109632.html,"The House Republican whip team will canvass to see where lawmakers stand. House moves toward vote on border
After a day of embarrassing failures, House Republican leadership inched toward bringing a new emergency funding bill for the border crisis to the floor Friday.
The new legislation — described to GOP lawmakers in a closed-door meeting in the Capitol — uses revised language from Texas Rep. John Carter, Alabama Rep. Robert Aderholt and Georgia Rep. Jack Kingston that tightens a 2008 trafficking law that has made it more difficult to deport children from countries other than Canada and Mexico.

The bill is more costly than the legislation that had to be yanked from the floor Thursday. The latest version sends $35 million to governors to pay for the National Guard units involved in responding to the crisis, boosting the price tag to $694 million — still a far cry from the nearly $4 billion President Barack Obama requested. It is still fully offset by spending cuts, GOP sources said.
( Also on POLITICO: House GOP talks new border bill)
The House will also hold a separate vote that significantly reins in President Barack Obama’s power to shield undocumented immigrants from deportations — teeing off a popular 2012 administration initiative that protected so-called “Dreamers.”
The House is heading toward an evening vote on the border package. Friday’s changes seemed to build support for the package among House Republicans but prompted an angry response from Obama.
“House Republicans as we speak are trying to pass the most extreme and unworkable version of a bill that they already know is going nowhere, that can’t pass the Senate,” Obama told reporters at the White House. “They’re not even trying to solve the problem.”
Lawmakers and aides said the language regarding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals is being changed so the roughly 550,000 current beneficiaries, who are granted a two-year reprieve from deportations, will be blocked from renewing their status in the program. That essentially makes those hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants eligible for deportations.
( Also on POLITICO: House GOP in disarray: Border fight delays recess)
That change is a clear nod to the conservatives in the conference, who have widely blamed the Obama administration program as the root cause of the steep increase in unaccompanied migrant children coming to the U.S.-Mexico border.
But the vote will put a handful of Republican lawmakers representing significant Latino constituencies in a tough political spot.
“I think we should be very generous with those children who have not done anything wrong,” said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), who plans to vote against the anti-DACA measure. “I’ve always said the United States is a meritocracy … there’s no secret about my position.”
The House held a procedural vote late in the morning to determine the level of support for the bill. Senior GOP leadership sources said Friday morning they expect to pass the bill, and leave town for the month at the end of the day.
Beyond the border bill, GOP leaders are talking about introducing another bill to plus up funding for the Iron Dome missile defense system in Israel.
As a policy matter, the border bill matters little because the Senate has already left town for the month and Obama would never support it.
Still, the Democratic response was immediate. On the other end of the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said the House GOP was “heading from bad to worse.”
“Let’s be clear about what’s happening today on the other side of the Capitol,” Reid said. “House Republicans will vote to deport children who have been living in the United States their entire lives.”
At a press conference with House Democratic leadership and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) leveled sharp criticism at Republican lawmakers who have used harsh language to characterize the unaccompanied children coming to the border.
“They have said that they are disease-ridden, lice-filled, gangbangers, drug dealers, mules of the drug cartels who have come here in hordes to invade our nation,” a furious Gutierrez said. “Now they are demonstrating that that’s how they feel in their legislation because they have to go down to the least common denominator of hatefulness toward an immigrant community”
“And when they say it about the children, they say it about all of us,” he added.
Politically, the House package has serious implications for Republicans. The Senate has not been able to pass its border bill, and House Republicans were determined to something before leaving for the August recess to show that they’re at least trying to address the humanitarian crisis.
In the closed meeting, the legislation was picking up support from the most conservative parts of the House Republican Conference. GOP Reps. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) and Steve King (Iowa) — among the biggest immigration hardliners in Congress — were on board, illustrating that the legislation will likely be accepted by the hard right.
Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.), a key lawmaker behind drafting the conference’s policy recommendations to the border crisis, said several Republicans who would have rejected the leadership’s border-crisis proposal stood up during the closed-door session and said they would switch their votes.
“I think this was one of the best conferences we’ve had over the past couple of years,” said Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.). “I’m going to go back and re-read the changes, but I think you’re going to see a strong positive vote for this bill” from Republicans.
However, other conservatives remained unconvinced or “no” votes, saying they were not satisfied by the changes made to the bill by the leadership.
Rep. John Fleming (R-La.) said he was concerned that a second bill that targets the Obama administration’s deferred action program would fail, meaning the House would pass an emergency border funding bill without addressing what he says is the cause of the crisis.
“I don’t see how I can go back to my district and say I appropriated money to the president without fixing the underlying problem first,” Fleming said. “If you’re asking me to vote for a ‘message bill,’ which is the border bill, then I also have to be part of the most important part of the message, and that is to stop DACA itself. That’s what is creating the problem.”
And Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said he would still vote against the border supplemental, though he would vote in favor of gutting DACA.
Passing this legislation today is important for Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, who became House majority whip Thursday. On his first day in leadership, Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California had to pull the original border security package from the House floor.
Carter’s proposal is key to this new package. The Texas Republican said the language he used is a “little tighter” than the bill presented Thursday. But he didn’t attend strategy sessions Thursday night to cobble the new package together.
“I had other things I had to do,” Carter said."
6602,"House GOP resurrects border bill, predicts successful Friday vote'",Washington Times,8/1/2014,,,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/1/house-gop-resurrects-border-bill-predicts-successf/,"House Republicans resurrected their border bill Friday morning and said they were on track to pass the rewritten measure later in the day — though with the Senate gone for the summer the vote will be more a political statement than a policy-making exercise.
GOP leaders weren’t making any predictions after suffering an embarrassing conservative rebellion on Thursday, which forced them back to the drawing board, but rank-and-file lawmakers said they believed they had finally corralled enough votes to pass it.
“We will finish the job. We will get it passed tonight,” said Rep. Matt Salmon, an Arizona Republican who said the changes made overnight were critical to earning enough votes.
The crux of the bill sends hundreds of millions of dollars to immigration agencies to house the illegal immigrant children and families surging across the border, and makes changes to a 2008 law that made it difficult to deport children from Central America.
In order to attract enough support, Republicans also added in another bill that would halt President Obama’s non-deportation policy for so-called Dreamers, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
Conservatives had supported both of those policies in general but balked at the way the bills were written, arguing they left too many loopholes that they believed Mr. Obama would use in refusing to enforce the laws.
As of late Friday morning GOP lawmakers were rewriting their bills to try to accommodate those concerns.
The procedural hiccups signal just how touchy the immigration issue is. Many Republicans want to vote on the strongest possible statement opposing Mr. Obama’s policies, and they fear his claims of unilateral authority to pick and choose how he enforces immigration laws.
Democratic leaders, meanwhile, have called for the GOP to forgo changes to the law, and instead want to see a bill that only spends money to house and care for the tens of thousands of children and families from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that are crossing the Rio Grande in search of a foothold in the U.S.
But Senate Democrats failed to win enough votes for that plan on Thursday, with even some of their own party colleagues joining Republicans in saying it doesn’t do anything to stop the flow of children.
After their failure, Senate Democrats closed the chamber down and sent most lawmakers home for a five-week summer vacation, meaning that regardless of what the House does, nothing can be sent to Mr. Obama’s desk.
“They never should have left in the first place,” said Rep. Michele M. Bachmann, Minnesota Republican. “We were here actively engaged on the House side, getting the job done on immigration. They couldn’t get the job done in the Senate.”
Rep. Phil Gingrey, Georgia Republican, said that at the very least the House had avoided a PR “disaster.”
“If we had gone home yesterday, I think that would have been a disaster,” said Rep. Phil Gingrey, Georgia Republican. “There is a humanitarian issue and you can’t explain all the nuances and connect every dot to all of 7,000 constituents. They are going to read the newspaper and they’re going to say, ‘Oh, those Republicans went home, didn’t have a vote and now they are going on a five-week vacation.’”

3936,House GOP moves closer to deal on immigration bill ahead of recess',Washington Post,8/1/2014,,,http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-gop-moves-closer-on-immigration-bill-ahead-of-recess/2014/08/01/11084a2e-1983-11e4-9e3b-7f2f110c6265_story.html,"House Republicans managed Friday to overcome deep divisions within the party and passed two measures to address the child-migrant surge at the U.S.-Mexico border.
The bills would provide emergency funding to deal with the crisis, speed the deportations of most border-crossers and rescind President Obama’s authority to decide whether to deport certain illegal immigrants.
The measures are unlikely to become law, as the White House, most Democrats and immigration advocates strongly oppose the proposals.
The votes amounted to a do-over and a crucial victory for a new GOP leadership team and provided rank-and-file Republicans with recorded proof that they attempted to address the border issue, after struggling Thursday to reach intraparty consensus. But with the House unable to broker an agreement with the Senate over how to respond to Obama’s emergency request to handle the crisis, the president promised Friday that he would move ahead with his own response.
“I’m going to have to act alone,” Obama said, because federal resources have run dry with the lack of legislation. “We’ve run out of money.”
Obama continued his recent habit of castigating congressional Republicans, saying the party is not “actually trying to solve the problem” of immigration but instead is attempting to pass legislation so they can “check a box before they leave town for a month.”
The votes held late Friday — a rare occurrence any time of the year on Capitol Hill — capped a week of turmoil in the GOP ranks prompted by fierce opposition from the party’s conservative members to doing anything that could be perceived as an endorsement of Obama’s current immigration policy. With conservatives threatening to withhold support, top leaders abruptly withdrew border security legislation Thursday afternoon and announced plans to leave Washington without acting. Infuriated, several GOP moderates confronted Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) on the House floor, forcing them to recalibrate and cancel plans to begin the recess.
The collapse of the original border security plan offered by House GOP leaders was a triumph for conservatives in the Republican caucus, who saw it as a high point in their troubled relationship with Boehner and his more centrist leadership team.
Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), one of those conservatives, described the retreat by Boehner as one of the highlights of her career, because the leadership was forced to mostly capitulate to the conservative demands.
“Leadership knew they couldn’t pass their bill,” Bachmann said, and as a result were forced to agree to revisions offered by tea party members, led by Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), a vocal opponent of Obama’s immigration policy who has been criticized by Democrats and immigration advocates for his harsh descriptions of migrants seeking to cross the border.
When the conservatives sat down to hash out differences with GOP leadership Thursday night in the basement of the U.S. Capitol, “it went as smooth as silk,” Bachmann said. “Steve laid it out, and in less than two hours, we worked it out. It was really a painless process. But it was the first time that I’ve seen leadership recognize, with respect and admiration, the work that Steve King did. Steve helped to completely gut this bill.”
Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.), another conservative who attended the meeting, gave leaders credit for allowing conservatives to air their concerns. “Those concerns were addressed. To me, that’s the way the process should work,” he said.

By Friday, the rebels were feeling bullish. Walking into a closed-door meeting of Republicans, King told reporters, “I think we’ll get a deal done.” Once inside, he spoke in support of the legislation.
Most rank-and-file members predicted that the struggle to secure the necessary votes would be resolved quickly.
“I’m so confident, I’ve got a packed bag,” Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) said Friday morning as he carried a military camouflaged backpack into the closed-door meeting. Other Republicans were seen pulling suitcases into the Capitol in anticipation of quick getaways.
Ultimately, members voted 223 to 189 to approve $694 million in additional funding for federal agencies dealing with the influx of immigrants — a sum far lower than Obama’s original $3.7 billion request. The bill would tweak a 2008 anti-trafficking law and make it easier for the government to deport Central American minors who have entered the United States illegally. It also would provide $35 million to border-state governors, who would be given broader legal authority to deploy the National Guard.
Concerns about a governor’s ability to deploy National Guard troops came to a head in recent weeks as Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) took steps to activate about 1,000 troops to deploy to the Rio Grande Valley, after he said Obama had rebuffed requests for a federal deployment order.
Four Republicans, some of the most conservative in the chamber, voted against the bill.
All but one Democrat voted against the bill, reflecting the opposition of the White House and several organizations working with illegal immigrants, including prominent religious leaders. In a sharply worded statement, Bishop Eusebio Elizondo of Seattle, who leads the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ work on immigration issues, called passage of the legislation “a low point for our country. It eviscerates American values of justice and due process and stains our record as a defender of human rights globally.”
Later in the evening, Republicans passed a second, more aggressive proposal backed by the most ardent conservatives that would curtail an Obama administration program that provides protections to about 500,000 immigrants who were brought to the country as children. The bill passed 216 to 192 with 11 Republicans voting against it and four Democrats voting for it. One Democrat voted present.
Republicans in recent weeks have cited the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program as a key enticement for illegal migrants seeking to make their way north to the United States.
Democrats blasted Republicans for introducing the legislation, saying that it would unfairly target hundreds of thousands of law-abiding children and their parents.
Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), who represents a Miami-area district packed with immigrants from across Latin America, said that he and other moderates in similar districts planned to vote against the bill, “but I don’t criticize folks for being concerned about the president overstepping his constitutional boundary.”
“Most of the conservatives who have a problem [with DACA] have more of a problem with how the president did it than what the president did,” Diaz-Balart said.
House Democrats, with little to do but wait for Republicans to decide how to proceed, tried in vain repeatedly Friday to introduce a competing immigration measure that includes a proposal approved in a bipartisan fashion last year by the Senate. But Republicans objected each time.
Dozens of Democrats also took to the House floor to criticize Republicans for attempting to turn back young immigrants fleeing violence in Central America or for seeking to end the temporary relief provided to some children of illegal immigrants.
Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.) said the Republican legislation “has only one message: ‘Deport! Deport! Deport!’ ”
During a news conference held by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez (D-Ill.) switched between English and Spanish to express his outrage. Using Spanish to address Spanish-language television reporters, he said Republicans “want to punish our community. And the punishment will be reciprocated with a political punishment. Be sure that we are not going to forget the bad treatment that our community has received.”
The votes held late Friday capped a week of turmoil on Capitol Hill as both chambers stumbled toward resolution on a series of complex issues. The Senate adjourned Friday after approving $225 million in emergency funding for Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system, a measure adopted later by the House by a 395-to-8 vote.
But senators failed to confirm dozens of nominees to serve as U.S. ambassadors to several countries, including Guatemala — where much of the immigration crisis originates — and South Korea, a key Asian ally.
With lawmakers preparing to scatter for campaign rallies, town hall meetings, taxpayer-funded fact-finding missions and vacations with family and friends, House and Senate leaders made plans to reconvene the week of Sept. 8, with less than two weeks’ worth of legislative days scheduled before Election Day in November.

5204,Border crisis bill dies in House',Fox News (Online),7/31/2014,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/07/31/republicans-launch-bid-to-short-circuit-obama-executive-action-on-illegal/,"House Republican leaders are trying anew to round up an elusive majority for a bill addressing the border crisis, after a chaotic day where they initially abandoned the legislation and began sending lawmakers home for the summer recess -- only to reverse course moments later.
The dramatic scene unfolded at a rapid clip Thursday afternoon. Earlier, House leaders abruptly canceled a planned vote on a package meant to address the surge of illegal immigrant minors crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, with a combination of funding and policy changes, after failing to gather enough votes for it.
Lawmakers began heading out for the five-week summer recess. But incoming House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., then took to the floor to say ""additional votes are possible,"" indicating lawmakers should stay. Boos could be heard in the House chamber as he made the announcement.
But House Republicans later huddled on Capitol Hill before the House adjourned for the day. It was scheduled to meet again Friday morning.
Meanwhile, a different piece of border legislation died Thursday night in the Senate on a procedural vote. So even if the House did succeed in passing a bill Friday, there was no prospect for reaching a deal to send a bill to Obama's desk.
More On This...
The second thoughts in the House reflected deep concerns in the GOP caucus about the prospect of leaving for the August recess without addressing the border bill, amid criticism from both sides of the aisle.
It remains unclear whether there's any chance enough votes can be rounded up to pass the measure. Senior Republican leaders were adamant, though, that something must be done, regardless of the looming recess.
""We'll stay until we vote,"" House oversight committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said.
Asked if the House can find a solution, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., said: ""We'd better.""
If lawmakers do end up breaking for recess without a bill, House leaders left open the possibility of recalling members if need be when they feel they have a majority of 218 votes. Earlier, sources said GOP leaders were ""way short"" of the votes they needed, with conservative lawmakers joining Democrats in refusing to back the package.
Asked Thursday afternoon if the bill still has a chance, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky., said: ""We'll see."" He told Fox News that he was at the airport when his secretary told him to return to Capitol Hill.
A joint statement from House Republican leaders said the ""situation shows the intense concern within our conference -- and among the American people -- about the need to ensure the security of our borders and the president's refusal to faithfully execute our laws.""
In the absence of legislation, Republicans urged President Obama to act on his own to secure the borders and safely deport illegal immigrant children.
""We will continue to work on solutions to the border crisis and other challenges facing our country,"" they said.
But Senate Democrats blasted their House colleagues for dropping the legislation. ""Shame on the House of Representatives,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry also slammed his fellow Republicans, saying ""it's beyond belief that Congress is abandoning its post while our border crisis continues to create humanitarian suffering.""
The legislation's prospects changed quickly over the course of the day. Initially, House leaders thought they had a plan to win enough support, by scheduling a separate vote on legislation to prohibit Obama from expanding a policy that lets some illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children stay. Amid reports that the administration is considering such an expansion, the bill by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., would specifically bar the president from broadening the 2012 policy.
Republicans say another illegal immigrant reprieve by the president would only exacerbate the surge of illegal immigrant children trekking to the U.S.-Mexico border from Central America.
""Such action would create an even greater incentive for more illegal crossings and make the crisis on our border even worse, and that would be a grave mistake,"" House Speaker John Boehner said Thursday.
The vote had been scheduled by Republican leaders as part of the effort to win conservative support for the separate, scaled-down package giving the Department of Homeland Security an immediate $659 million to address the border crisis and making other policy changes.
But Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, nevertheless raised concerns with House members about their version of the border legislation, and lawmakers and aides said Thursday that it had an impact. They also pointed to opposition from Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.
Sessions voiced concerns about both the House and Senate proposals, arguing that the Senate would never take up the executive action bill being considered in the House. Sessions wants any bill addressing the president's funding request to also address the executive action issue.
""We as policy makers must face the reality that the president is openly planning to use executive actions to provide amnesty and work permits to millions without any lawful authority,"" he said in a statement.
Democrats, meanwhile, accused Republicans of playing games.
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said earlier in the day: ""It is extraordinary that the House of Representatives, after failing for more than a year to reform our broken immigration reform system, would vote to restrict a law enforcement tool that the Department of Homeland Security uses to focus resources on key enforcement priorities like public safety and border security, and provide temporary relief from deportation for people who are low priorities for removal.""

6136,Blow to House G.O.P. Leadership as Border Bill Falters',New York Times (Online News),7/31/2014,,,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/us/politics/blow-to-house-gop-leadership-as-border-bill-falters-.html,"WASHINGTON — Conservatives in the House rebelled against their leadership on Thursday to scuttle an emergency spending measure that addressed the migrant crisis at the southern border, pushing the issue to a showdown on Friday as lawmakers prepared to leave for a five-week recess. The unexpected turmoil offered a coda to the dysfunction that has gripped the Capitol for much of the year.
The failure of the comparatively modest Republican border bill, coupled with the Senate’s own inability to even bring a Democratic alternative to a vote, emphasized how the prospects of a broad immigration overhaul — which at the beginning of the 113th Congress held great bipartisan promise — have ground to a crashing halt.
The struggle to deal with immigration, which became more urgent with the flood of tens of thousands of children at the border, succumbed to congressional infighting, driven by more conservative Republicans who balked at further government spending and President Obama’s approach on deporting the migrants.
Fissures were evident in the Republican Party, with many House members critical of their more conservative colleagues for holding up the bill, arguing that heading home for the August break having not even voted on immigration legislation would be politically damaging. The episode was also a rebuke, at least temporarily, for Speaker John A. Boehner and his new leadership team, who in an emergency closed-door meeting on Thursday told members that they were not even close to the necessary votes required to pass the bill."

House Republicans are poised to delay their August recess by one day, as they frantically scramble to pass a border security bill.
After a chaotic afternoon, which saw the GOP leadership suddenly pull their legislation from the House floor because of flagging support, lawmakers planned a Friday morning meeting at 9 a.m. to try to plot a path forward. Plans are in flux, and subject to change at any minute, aides and lawmakers warned.

In a Thursday afternoon meeting, Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) heard from a number of Republicans who did not want to leave Washington until a package passed the House — a sentiment reflected by nearly every lawmaker who emerged after the meeting ended.

“I’m willing to stay here ‘til the cows come home,” said Rep. Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.). “Use your metaphor — hell freezes over, cows come home.”
But all day Thursday, the votes in support of the original $659 million border bill faded away, and it’s unclear if Scalise will be able to recapture votes in support of the package. Thursday was his first day as whip.
Lawmakers were supposed to be heading home Thursday to begin a five-week recess. But the House schedule was in such flux that members walked off the floor canceling and rebooking flights to go home.
After the bill was pulled, Boehner (R-Ohio) was surrounded on the House floor by a dozen colleagues while incoming McCarthy (R-Calif.) was also talking to fellow lawmakers.

Democrats in the Senate, who are struggling to pass their own border bill, took the opportunity to poke the Republican House. When asked whether he was surprised Boehner didn’t seem to have the votes for the GOP bill, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid quipped: “No. Not the first time.”
The GOP legislation, which was rewritten twice to attract support, had trouble getting off the ground, and if the House doesn’t vote, lawmakers will head back to their districts to hear from voters with a crisis raging at the border.
The turmoil is stunning considering how far to the right the GOP leadership pulled this bill. Boehner, McCarthy and Scalise, the new GOP whip, crafted a process that would have given the House a vote on legislation to stop the Obama administration from expanding its deferred deportation program. But even that wasn’t enough.
The episode is most embarrassing for Scalise, whose allies crowed this week about running a more effective whip organization than McCarthy, the longtime Republican vote counter who will now be the majority leader.
(Also on POLITICO: CIA sorry for Senate snooping)
The political impact of this decision is not clear, but if the House doesn’t vote, Democrats will be able to say that the GOP left Washington for an entire month without passing legislation to address the influx of migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border.
The challenges facing the House bill were evident earlier Thursday, when hard-right conservatives indicated that they still weren’t appeased by the last-minute offer of a vote on the immigration deferral program — known as DACA — in exchange for moving forward on the border funding bill.
This bloc demanded tougher border-security and immigration provisions in the supplemental package while also pressing for the language rolling back DACA to be included in the funding bill.
“I don’t like it,” Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.) said of the two-step strategy Thursday morning. “We need to get rid of DACA, and the bill itself is bad.”
( Also on POLITICO: Lerner email: Some in GOP 'crazies')
Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), another conservative, had already started to circulate a Dear Colleague letter warning Republicans against the stand-alone vote on DACA.
More than 57,000 unaccompanied children, mostly from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, have been apprehended at the southern border since October — exhausting government resources and leading federal agencies to warn that they will begin running out of money in August to deal with the crisis.
Beyond providing funds for the border, the House bill would have revised a 2008 anti-trafficking law that has, in practice, made it more difficult to deport children from countries other than Mexico or Canada. The legislation also called for bolstering National Guard presence on the border.
The White House blasted the House’s plan on Thursday after leaders tacked on the DACA vote. The deferral program was announced by President Barack Obama in June 2012 in the middle of his reelection bid. More than 550,000 young undocumented immigrants who grew up in the United States have been protected from deportation and gotten work permits under the program.
But Republicans have blamed DACA for contributing to the current crisis on the border , arguing that it sends a message to children from abroad that they, too, could be allowed to stay here lawfully.
“It is extraordinary that the House of Representatives, after failing for more than a year to reform our broken immigration reform system, would vote to restrict a law enforcement tool that the Department of Homeland Security uses to focus resources on key enforcement priorities like public safety and border security, and provide temporary relief from deportation for people who are low priorities for removal,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.
House Democratic leadership pressured its rank and file throughout the week to reject the border spending bill, denying the GOP of votes to offset defections in their own part. Most Democrats raised humanitarian objections to changing the 2008 trafficking law.
“Clearly, many factors led these desperate parents to hand off their children to complete strangers with the hope they make their way to safety here,” Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) said. “We ought to consider the complicated policy questions and provide a carefully considered solution. Yet these policy changes reveal a knee-jerk response coupled with another bill to deport children who are already in the U.S.”

5325,Administration Considers Giving Honduran Youth Refugee Status',Townhall,7/26/2014,,,http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/07/25/immigration-honduras-n1866516,"At this point in the border crisis, one would think the administration would be doing all it can to actually stem the flow of illegal immigrants from Central America. In reality, however, it seems some of their proposed solutions would do just the opposite.
The New York Times reports:
Hoping to stem the recent surge of migrants at the Southwest border, the Obama administration is considering whether to allow hundreds of minors and young adults from Honduras into the United States without making the dangerous trek through Mexico, according to a draft of the proposal. If approved, the plan would direct the government to screen thousands of children and youths in Honduras to see if they can enter the United States as refugees or on emergency humanitarian grounds. It would be the first American refugee effort in a nation reachable by land to the United States, the White House said, putting the violence in Honduras on the level of humanitarian emergencies in Haiti and Vietnam, where such programs have been conducted in the past amid war and major crises.
Yes, you read that correctly. The administration is considering a plan that would allow Hondurans under the age of 21 (and possibly El Salvadorans and Guatemalans) to apply to the program in their own country. And the reason they need refugee status? Because they’re fleeing dangerous street gangs. Question: what can the children in Chicago’s South Side claim to get protection?
But seriously, how exactly will this decrease the number of Central Americans coming into the U.S.? Sure, we would have more control over who may fit the program's criteria, but what's to say those who don't won't try for the amnesty route and make the trek up north anyway? And if the definition of refugee is stretched to include people fleeing 'general crime and violence,' it's safe to say America's doors really are wide open--to untold numbers of people all around the world.
Under American law, refugees are people fleeing their country of origin based on fears of persecution by reason of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. The only category that would seem to apply is “social group,” experts said, but there is disagreement on what that means. Some contend that children could count as a group, but others say the refugee requirements are stricter, and would not apply to people fleeing general crime and violence. “What is a social group?” said Muzaffar Chishti, director of migration policies for the Migration Policy Institute’s New York office. “This is going to create a huge deal of debate. You will see a lot of law developing on it.”
Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, told The New York Times that migrants would need “nothing more than a bus ride to the consulate” to claim to be refugees. “We’re talking about, down the road, an enormous additional flow of people from those countries.”
And guess what? If it doesn't increase the total number of refugees coming into the country, President Obama's pen and phone can make this happen, no congressional approval needed.

They say they're working on a plan to address underlying cause of migration
The Obama administration is buoyed by slight slowing of migrant kids at the border
Congress working on scaled-back plan, but House and Senate divided on approach
Central American leaders signaled to President Barack Obama they're working on a ""comprehensive plan"" to address the underlying reasons for the surge of immigrant youth from their countries who are entering the United States illegally.
The presidents of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala met with Obama at the White House on Friday as Washington struggles to find a solution to what many consider a humanitarian crisis.
The influx this year of tens of thousands of child immigrants, many unaccompanied, has become a partisan flashpoint on the already divisive issue of reforming a U.S. immigration system that all sides agree is broken.
Obama and Presidents Otto Perez Molina of Guatemala, Juan Orlando Hernandez of Honduras, and Salvador Sanchez Ceren of El Salvador issued a statement that reiterated ""our commitment to prevent families and children from undertaking this dangerous journey and to work together to promote safe, legal, and orderly migration.""
They ""all agreed that an effective solution requires a comprehensive and joint effort"" from those countries, other nations in the region and the United States, they said.

Specifically, the Central American presidents ""indicated"" to Obama that they were working on a plan to address the root causes of why people are leaving their countries.
Underlying causes
Part of that, all at the meeting agreed, must address strategies for reducing crime and promoting greater social and economic opportunity.
Priorities include pursuing criminal enterprises ""that are exploiting this uniquely vulnerable population"" and the need to discourage use of ""smuggling networks"" that place immigrants at ""high risk of violent crime and sexual abuse.""
Obama and the others also pledged to redouble efforts to counter misinformation about U.S. deportation policy around young immigrants that some say is fueling the surge, and promised to further efforts to ""humanely repatriate migrants, consistent with due process.""
Most can't stay
Obama told the Central American leaders that most of the child migrants crossing the border illegally now won't be permitted to stay. Some have been deported already, while most are being allowed to stay temporarily while their immigration status is sorted out.
Also being discussed within the Obama administration has been a pilot program that would let the United States assess asylum claims in those countries in order to reduce the number of illegal immigrants. But Obama sought to play down that option as an answer.
""There may be some narrow circumstances in which there is humanitarian or refugee status that a family might be eligible for. If that's the case it would be better for them to apply in country rather than take a very dangerous journey all the way up to Texas to make those same claims,"" Obama said.
But he added that potential applicants would still have to meet the same criteria to qualify.
""Under U.S. law, we admit a certain number of refugees from all over the world based on some fairly narrow criteria and typically refugee status is not just based on economic need or because a family lives in a bad neighborhood or in poverty it's typically defined fairly narrowly,"" he said.
The White House previously called the idea premature. But spokesman Josh Earnest said before Friday's meeting that it could be extended to other countries, if successful.
Struggling for a solution
The administration and Congress have struggled in recent weeks to come to a consensus on how to address the surge that has overwhelmed border and immigration services.
Obama has asked Congress for $3.7 billion in emergency funds for border efforts, while Republicans and some Democrats in Congress are resisting that proposal, and offering alternatives that would spend less and change immigration policy to deport kids faster.
Either way, Obama and others are concerned that lawmakers will leave at the end of next week for their August recess without approving a fix.
House Republicans are expected to vote on a scaled-down border bill next week. It would provide less than $1 billion to address the crisis and would modify a 2008 law to make it easier to deport children from Central America who enter the United States illegally.
Currently, kids who enter the country illegally from Central America can stay until they receive an immigration hearing. That process can take months or years.
The proposal to alter that law all but ensures the bill will not come to a vote in the Senate, where Democrats are opposed to tagging that change to a funding bill of its own for the border crisis.
Democrats worry that accelerating the process will result in many falling through the cracks and being sent back to situations characterized by many as violent situations in their countries.
Guard troops to border
The administration also is considering sending National Guard troops to the border, according to a White House official, just days after Texas Gov. Rick Perry said he would do just that in the Rio Grande Valley area.
The Pentagon and the Department of Health and Human Services sent a team this week to assess Border Patrol efforts in the Rio Grande Valley. The number of unaccompanied minors seeping through that area has slowed dramatically since last month."

There’s no denying the impact of this latest immigration wave or the need for more resources. But there’s no crisis. Local communities like mine have done an amazing job of assisting these migrants.
Rather, the myth of a “crisis” is being used by politicians to justify ever-tighter restrictions on immigration, play to anti-immigrant voters in the fall elections and ignore the reasons so many children are coming here in the first place.
In the last month, about 2,500 refugees have been brought to El Paso after crossing the border elsewhere. The community quickly came together to support the women and children and Annunciation House, the organization coordinating the effort."

Feds to schools: Let undocumented immigrants in
The Obama administration delivered an unequivocally clear message — again — on Thursday: All children have a right to enroll in public schools regardless of their citizenship or immigration status.
Three years after clarifying to schools that they cannot turn away children, the Education and Justice Departments issued another set of guidance documents that provide in painstaking detail what schools can and cannot ask for when families want to enroll their children. The agencies also provided examples of acceptable enrollment policies.

For example, schools can violate federal law by requiring Social Security numbers or birth certificates when a student wants to enroll. Schools can instead ask for proof of residency in a school district, which a family can do with an electric bill or copy of a lease.
In a Dear Colleague letter, the agencies say they’ve recently “become aware of student enrollment practices that may chill or discourage the participation, or lead to the exclusion, of students based on their or their parents’ or guardians’ actual or perceived citizenship or immigration status.”
( Also on POLITICO: Why Obama may never get bill on immigration)
The Department of Homeland Security estimates that there are 1.1 million undocumented children under age 18 living in the U.S.
On a call with reporters, Education Secretary Arne Duncan said that the department’s Office for Civil Rights has received 17 complaints related to school enrollment policies since its 2011 guidance on the issue. The complaints came from all over the country, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine Lhamon said: Colorado, D.C., Michigan, Ohio, Louisiana, New Mexico and North Carolina, among others.
Those are in addition to an undisclosed number of complaints filed with the Justice Department. DOJ’s Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Jocelyn Samuels said her agency has also received complaints from all over the country. Samuels said state education agencies are cooperating with the federal government. In one case, DOJ evaluated the enrollment policies of more than 200 school districts in Georgia and helped schools fix problems. And the Education Department has provided technical assistance to school districts for the last several years.
( DRIVING THE DAY: Immigration's road to nowhere?)
“Public school districts have an obligation to enroll students regardless of immigration status and without discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin,” Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. “The Justice Department will do everything it can to make sure schools meet this obligation. We will vigilantly enforce the law to ensure the schoolhouse door remains open to all.”
These state and district obligations are the result of the 1982 Supreme Court decision Plyler v. Doe, which struck down a Texas law that denied education funding for undocumented children. It also struck down the Tyler, Texas, school district’s attempt to charge undocumented families tuition to make up for the lost state funding.
As immigration reform stalls in Congress, states including Alabama and Arizona have passed their own laws to address the issue. Parts of the Alabama law dealing with school admissions have been blocked by courts, and much of Arizona’s law was nullified, too. State policies can’t trump the 32-year-old Supreme Court ruling, but the dueling requirements have clouded the picture for schools.
Jerri Katzerman, deputy legal director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, is less charitable.
“Some of it is ignorance, both feigned and acquired,” Katzerman said. “Often schools will say, ‘We didn’t deny any child.’ But we’ll ask, ‘How many children didn’t go through the process because of fear?’ It doesn’t create an inclusive, welcoming environment.”
Lhamon said that even after the court halted the provision of the Alabama law requiring schools to determine immigration status, the agencies continued to hear complaints. She said officials discovered that some fearful parents were even withdrawing their children from school.
In Alabama in 2013, a study conducted by the SPLC found that out of a sample of 124 enrollment forms representing 81 school districts, not a single one was complying with federal law regarding requests for Social Security numbers, Katzerman said.
The law doesn’t bar schools from asking for Social Security numbers in general. But if they do, they must detail how they plan to use the information and stipulate that the information is voluntary, will be kept confidential and will never keep a student from enrolling.
In one case, the SPLC found that a magnet school program in Mobile County, Alabama, asked for Social Security numbers and used an asterisk to indicate that it was required information. The enrollment form also asked for the Social Security numbers of an applicant’s siblings.
Asking for information about a students’ citizenship or immigration status is exclusionary and can trigger fear in immigrant families looking to enroll their children in public schools, Katzerman said.
In another recent incident, the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey sent a warning to a New Jersey school district that was requiring “overly restrictive forms of identification” for children looking to enroll in public school.
Some schools have been less than responsive when told they’re out of compliance, Katzerman said.
“One school district said to us, ‘OK, we understand now, but we already printed all of our forms, and it would be too expensive to go back and reprint them,’” she said.
The findings led Alabama state Superintendent Thomas Bice to issue a memorandum to local education leaders outlining their legal responsibilities. But a year later, Katzerman said, some schools are still making the same mistakes.
The SPLC has even heard from families who say schools are asking for Social Security numbers so their children can participate in extracurricular activities, she said. The organization is now updating its study after hearing such anecdotes.
“We want to be sure every school leader understands the legal requirements under the Constitution and federal laws, and it is our hope that this update will address some of the misperceptions out there,” Duncan said in a statement. “The message here is clear: Let all children who live in your district enroll in your public schools.”
Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro also lauded the guidance.
“As Justice Earl Warren eloquently wrote in his opinion for Brown v. Board of Education, ‘it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he [or she] is denied the opportunity of an education,’” the Connecticut Democrat said. “Those words are as true today as they were in 1954. Public schools have an obligation to educate all children so they can one day grow up to be successful, active members of society.”
The guidance also protects homeless children, allowing them to enroll in school even when their families can’t provide proof of residency. And Katzerman said it’s encouraging that the guidance urges school districts to foster inclusive environments by educating families about their rights and reassuring them that their children are welcome in school.
The Education and Justice Departments also stress that schools have to “meaningfully communicate material information about enrollment” for families that aren’t proficient in English. Failing to provide interpreters or translated materials is often a problem, Katzerman said."
4770,No school choice: Holder mandates schools must enroll children of illegal immigrants',Washington Times,5/8/2014,,,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/8/holder-schools-must-enroll-children-illegals/,"Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday that all schools must enroll illegal immigrants as students, citing “troubling reports” that some districts are discriminating against the children of undocumented parents.
“Public school districts have an obligation to enroll students regardless of immigration status and without discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin,” Mr. Holder said in a statement released Thursday by the Justice Department. He said the department will do “everything it can” to make sure schools meet this obligation.
Mr. Holder was joined by Education Secretary Arne Duncan in issuing the new guidance to school administrators, telling them to be more flexible in accepting some documents from illegal parents and not to require others that may prove a child’s age and residence. The guidance is an update to earlier guidelines the Justice Department issued to school systems in 2011.
Although schools have a right to establish a child’s residency in a district, they don’t need to require the parents to have state-issued driver’s licenses or Social Security cards to prove they are in the country legally, the new guidelines state. Parents can produce a utility bill or a lease as a substitute.
The guidance is based on a 1982 Supreme Court decision that says children of illegal immigrants have a right to a public education. In Plyler v. Doe, the court struck down a Texas statute that denied funding for education to the children of illegal immigrants and a school district’s attempt to charge undocumented persons an annual $1,000 tuition fee for each illegal immigrant student.
Some states and school boards have challenged the ruling, most notably California in 1994, when voters approved a referendum to deny all state-funded benefits — including education — to illegals. The courts later struck down the referendum.
In 1996, Congress tried to pass immigration legislation that would have allowed states to deny public education benefits to certain illegal aliens or to charge them tuition. But it was withdrawn after President Bill Clinton threatened to veto it.
School boards then began to take action against illegal immigrants by requiring Social Security numbers or driver’s licenses. The also employed practices such as proposing separate schools for immigrant students and requiring paperwork designed to identify immigration status.
Today, schools in New York, New Jersey and Arizona, among others, routinely inquire into immigration status as part of the enrollment process, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
In Alabama, public schools must determine the immigration status of children and parents during enrollment, and then can report the undocumented persons to immigration authorities.
The Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights has received 17 complaints related to enrollment policies since it first issued guidance in 2011, Mr. Duncan said. Complaints were from Ohio, Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Washington, D.C.,among others.
That’s in addition to a number of undisclosed complaints filed in the Justice Department. In Georgia, the Justice Department evaluated the enrollment policies of more than 200 school districts and helped them resolve issues, authorities said.
“We have continued to hear troubling reports of actions — being taken by school districts around the country — that have a chilling effect on student enrollment, raising barriers for undocumented children and children from immigrant families who seek to receive the public education to which they are entitled,” Mr. Holder said.
The ACLU applauded the new guidelines.
“Today’s updated guidance reaffirms the longstanding principle, established by the Supreme Court over 30 years ago, that all children living in our country have a right to equal access to public education,” ACLU Legislative Counsel Joanne Lin said in an e-mail. “School districts must adhere to this guidance, and meet their constitutional obligations to ensure that no child is locked outside the schoolhouse door.”

4277,"Republicans Warn Obama: Halt Deportations, And We Might Halt Immigration Reform'",HuffPost,2/5/2014,,,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/04/republicans-deportation_n_4725916.html,"WASHINGTON -- As activists continue their calls for President Barack Obama to suspend deportations, Republicans warned Tuesday that doing so could kill the chances for a more permanent solution.
""If you stop enforcing the law, that would build into the narrative that you can't trust him,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said, referring to Obama. ""If he stopped deporting people who are clearly here illegally, then I think any chance of immigration reform is dead.""
Graham isn't an opponent of immigration reform -- in fact, he's one of four Republicans who drafted the so-called ""gang of eight"" comprehensive bill that passed the Senate last June, and has continued to advocate for it since. But he, like many Republicans, has been critical of the president's actions on immigration. Republicans have insisted the lack of trust between the president and Republicans is the key impediment to reform. For some it's likely an excuse to pass over a topic they'd rather not deal with. But others insist it's a real problem.
The fact that supporters of reform on the Republican side warn against halting deportations shows the tough spot the White House is in. If the president does nothing, thousands of people will be deported who could have received legal status if Congress passed a bill. If the president acts, it could increase political tensions and doom a potential bill entirely.
Obama has said he has no plans to act administratively to suspend deportations along the same lines as he did for young undocumented immigrants through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. After being interrupted by an activist during a speech in November, Obama said he does not have the power to do so. Last week, however, he gave a slightly different answer when asked during a Google Hangout whether he would consider halting deportations.
""It is my firm belief that we can get immigration reform done this year,"" he said. ""I don't want to pre-suppose that we can't. Obviously, if at some point we see that it's not getting done, I'm going to look at all options to make sure that we have a rational, smart system of immigration.""
Advocates have argued Obama has the ability to expand a deferred action policy. The National Day Laborer Organizing Network filed a petition with the Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday saying, it would be ""sound policy and consistent with the President’s authority to make a categorical determination to prioritize resources away from the estimated 8 million"" undocumented immigrants who would be eligible for legal status under the Senate-passed immigration reform bill.
AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who supports reform, told The Washington Post last week that in his estimation, Obama could strengthen his hand by halting deportations.
""If I were president, I would have said the following: 'It's a broken system. Except for violent criminals, no more deportations until you help me fix a broken system,'"" Trumka said.
After Obama's statement, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), one of the top GOP supporters of reform in the House, said expanding deferred action would only worsen problems between the president and the Republicans over immigration.
""There is a trust gap that I think is the biggest obstacle we have to deal with,"" Diaz-Balart said on a conference call hosted last Friday by pro-reform advocacy group America's Voice. ""That statement is not helpful, other statements like that are not helpful.""
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a member of the gang of eight, has more recently backed away from supporting the bill becoming law. Rubio said Tuesday that if Obama suspended deportations, ""it would further undermine"" the president's argument that he is committed to enforcing immigration law. He reiterated that concern while giving lukewarm praise to the House GOP's recently-released immigration principles.
""They're principles that I think there's a large consensus on in the country, the problem is how to implement them,"" he said. ""What they're going to run into, and what they're already running into, is a sincere lack of trust, well-grounded, that this administration will enforce the security components of it no matter how they're written.""
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), another member of the gang of eight, agreed on whether Obama could halt deportations without killing reform.
""If he does that, it would be a very serious mistake,"" McCain said. ""It will authenticate the concerns that have been voiced by House members particularly, but also Senate members, that the president of the United States, even if we passed comprehensive immigration reform, would not enforce all parts of it."""

Speaking at a Heritage Foundation event, Republican House members said they don’t trust President Obama enough to follow through on the strict security measures the GOP would write into any bill, and said that must come first.
Rep. Raul Labrador, an Idaho Republican who last year was part of a group working on a broad immigration bill but who dropped out, scuttling the effort, said Mr. Obama should spend this year proving himself and then Republicans will act in 2015 if they win control of the Senate.
“We need to have the trust with this administration and that trust is not there, and until we have that trust there will be no immigration reform and it would be a mistake for leadership to push that,” Mr. Labrador said.
House Speaker John A. Boehner last week released principles that called for more security but also called for illegal immigrants getting legal status, and for young adult illegal immigrants to have a specific pathway to citizenship.
But Mr. Boehner himself said Tuesday that Republicans still haven’t decided whether to move forward with a bill this year.
Rep. Joe Barton, Texas Republican, said that while it’s not the right time to actually move a broad bill, the principles themselves are helpful to “begin a dialogue with the Hispanic community on conservative principles.”
The Senate passed a broad bill in June that includes citizenship rights for most illegal immigrants, clearing the measure on a bipartisan 68-32 vote. But even that legislation has run into problems.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, who voted against the Senate bill, said Tuesday that he doesn’t think there’s any way to match that legislation up with what the House is talking about.
“I don’t see how you get to an outcome this year with the two bodies in such a different place,” he said.
Democrats had hoped the release of the principles would pave the way for an agreement this year.
But the two sides are still far apart on big questions.
House Republicans have insisted the issue be tackled in a series of bills, while the Senate passed one massive measure. House Republicans also have insisted border security must come first, while the Senate bill grants quick legal status to most illegal immigrants while concurrently working to add more manpower and technology to the border.
The biggest sticking point, however, is the questions of citizenship. The Senate bill would offer a new specific pathway that would let most illegal immigrants get citizenship in about 13 years. House Republicans’ principles call for illegal immigrants to get some form of legal status, but only specifies a path to citizenship for young illegal immigrants, the so-called Dreamers brought to the U.S. by their parents, who are considered the most sympathetic cases.

""I really don't know the answer to that question, that is clearly in doubt,"" Ryan said when asked by ABC News's ""This Week"" host George Stephanopoulos whether reform could reach the White House by year's end.
If both house can agree to a reform that is primarily focused on security, ""then we might be able to get somewhere,"" Ryan said. ""But I just don't know if that's going to be the case.""
House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) echoed that sentiment in other appearances. Jindal urged a security-first approach, arguing that the current approach to immigration is ""completely backwards"" by making legal immigration too difficult and illegal immigration too easy, he said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""
President Obama told CNN's Jake Tapper that he considered the fact that House Republicans are preparing guidelines for reform a sign of progress.
""There is a desire to get it done and that, particularly in this Congress, is a huge piece of business,"" he said."

Immigration has been turned into a ""political football,"" Speaker Boehner says
President Barack Obama's State of the Union address and the traditional post-speech road trip were designed to boost both his agenda and Democratic chances in this difficult election year.
But there were instant reminders of the tough terrain, and internal Democratic jitters: The Democratic candidate for governor of Wisconsin was nowhere to be found when the President visited; that after several vulnerable Senate Democrats publicly tried to create distance between their re-election bids and Obama.
And then, this, in an exclusive conversation with CNN's Jake Tapper:
Tapper: ""It's possible that you might be able to get an immigration reform bill on your desk that has legal status for the millions of undocumented workers who are in this country, but not citizenship.

Would you veto that?""
Obama: ""Well, you know, I'm not going to prejudge what gets to my desk.""
On its own, maybe that's just a conciliatory tone so as not to become part of the GOP's debate about immigration.
But the timing makes the President's open mind more significant.
House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi just Wednesday said of the immigration debate: ""In our caucus there has to be a path of citizenship.""
And speaking to The Washington Post, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, whose unions are vital to Democratic midterm campaign chances, said of a GOP plan that provides legal status but not a guaranteed path to citizenship for illegal immigrants: ""It's a joke. It's a hoax, is what it is. It's like fool's gold.""
So Obama is now on record saying he won't prejudge an idea that is a nonstarter to the top House Democrat and a ""joke"" to organized labor. And he is not only at odds with those two traditional allies -- he is at odds with himself.
A year ago, speaking in Las Vegas, the President laid out his bottom line: ""For comprehensive immigration reform to work, it must be clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship,"" he said then.
The President's refusal to draw a veto line on the citizenship question will make his liberal base anxious, and those tensions could hurt in an election year.

But whether liberal disappointment now turns into a political problem closer to Election Day depends in large part on whether Republicans can test the President's openness by getting a bill to his desk.
And that remains a giant question mark.
Speaker John Boehner wants the House to pass, in several pieces, immigration changes that would include citizenship for so-called ""Dreamers"" -- younger undocumented people who were brought illegally into the United States by their parents -- but guarantee only legal status for older undocumented individuals.
If the House were to act, it would then need to try to reconcile its ideas with already passed Senate legislation. Democrats control the Senate, and finding common ground, again assuming the House acts, likely would prove difficult.
But, for now, the biggest question is whether the House will act.
Boehner not only believes the changes are good economic policy, he also is trying to help his party deal with a Latino voter crisis that significantly complicates any Republican White House aspirations.
But many Republican members of Congress are worried more about their 2014 races and angering the conservative base, whose turnout is critical in the midterm environment.

Most House Republicans believe any immigration debate distracts attention from Obamacare. And on the Senate side, there is less urgency as well because of the states the GOP is targeting in its effort to retake control.
The 11 seats now held by Democrats that are the top GOP targets have relatively small Latino populations. But in each of those, conservative GOP base turnout would be critical if the race is close come November.
The speaker understands that he is at center stage at the moment, and that any chance to see the Democratic immigration tensions in full force depends on whether the House can first advance something meaningful.
""It's been turned into a political football,"" the speaker said Thursday of the immigration debate. ""So I think it is time to deal with it. But how we deal with it is going to be critically important."""
6059,"Top Republicans support immigration reform, but stress border security must come first'",Fox News (Online),2/3/2014,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/02/02/top-republicans-support-immigration-reform-but-stress-border-security-must-come/,"Top Republicans made clear Sunday they want to improve the country’s immigration system but will not negotiate until U.S. borders are first secured.
“This is not trust but verify. This is a verify and trust approach,” Wisconsin GOP Rep. Paul Ryan told ABC’s “This Week.” “Security first, no amnesty, then we might be able to get somewhere.”
Ryan’s comments follow GOP House leadership releasing a plan last week that outlines a path toward legal status for some of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants now in the United States.
The plan includes tighter border security but no plan for those living in the U.S. illegally to achieve citizenship, a deal many conservatives consider amnesty.
Ryan, a member of House leadership and chairman of the House Budget Committee, also repeated that fellow party members don’t trust that the president will enforce border laws after a deal on immigration is reached.
“Those things have to be in law, in practice and independently verified before the rest of the law can occur,"" he said. ""So it's a security force first, non-amnesty approach.""
Ryan also acknowledged that the possibility of the House passing a bill that could reach the president's desk by the end of the year is still ""clearly in doubt.""
The Democrat-controlled Senate this past summer passed comprehensive immigration reform that included a 13-year path to citizenship for some living illegally in the U.S. But reform legislation has remained stalled in the GOP-led House over the citizenship issue and concern about Senate Democrats dominating should negotiators from both chambers meet to negotiate a compromise deal.
President Obama indicated last week that he might be open to legal status first, but restated such a plan cannot lead to two permanent categories of people – citizens and non-citizens.
“We think that was a pretty good step,” White House Chief of Staff Dennis McDonough said Sunday on NBC’s “This Week” about the GOP plan. “We feel pretty good that we’ll get this done this year.”
Louisiana Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” that Republicans should proceed with immigration reform because it’s the right thing to do, “not because of what some pollster tells us.”
Jindal, vice chairman of the Republican Governors Association, disagreed with the 2014 election strategy that Republicans should just let Obama and Democratic candidates stew in the problems associated with ObamaCare.
“There are a lot of folks in the Republican Party that would tell you the president is doing so poorly right now in the polls and especially with the flawed implementation and design of the Affordable Care Act that … we should stay out of his way and run 2014 as a referendum on that,” Jindal said. “I’m not one of those people.”
He also said the country should change its immigration system to ""high wall, broad gate."""
5282,"Inside Trump's proposal to suspend some legal immigration amid coronavirus crisis""",Reuters,4/24/2020,,,https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN22539S,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Wednesday that temporarily blocks some foreigners outside the United States from obtaining U.S. permanent residency, a move he said would protect American workers amid the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.
FILE PHOTO: A border commuter smokes a cigarette while crossing the border at the Paso del Norte International Bridge amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak between Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico and El Paso, Texas, U.S., April 22, 2020. REUTERS/Paul Ratje
The executive order included a number of exemptions and was not a full suspension of legal immigration, as suggested by a Trump tweet late on Monday night.
Here is what Trump’s order does and does not do.
WHO WILL BE AFFECTED?
The order blocks some foreigners outside the United States from settling permanently in the United States by obtaining what is informally known as a “green card.”
The measure applies to both requests for permanent residence based on employment in the United States and requests based on familial ties but contains a number of exceptions.
The order does not affect people coming to the United States on non-immigrant visas, including tourists and business travelers. It also does not affect workers such as farm laborers entering the United States on temporary visas or skilled workers on H-1B visas.
Foreigners already in the United States and seeking to adjust their status will not be blocked by the latest measure.
The vast majority of employment-based green cards are granted to people inside the United States, and thereby not covered by the ban. Most family-based green cards are granted to people outside the country, however.
The immediate impact of the order was not clear since most U.S. consulates around the world have already shuttered most immigration processing services.
WHO IS EXEMPT?
Doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals will be exempt, as will other prospective immigrants coming to the country to perform “essential” work to combat the new coronavirus, as determined by federal agencies.
The measure also excludes immigrants applying for the EB-5 visa program, which allows foreigners willing to invest large sums of money in U.S. projects that create or preserve jobs to obtain permanent residence.
The order makes an exception for spouses of U.S. citizens and their unmarried children under the age of 21.
The measure contains several other exemptions, including a general exemption for “any alien whose entry would be in the national interest.”
HOW LONG WILL THE SUSPENSION LAST?
The suspension will begin just before midnight on Thursday and last 60 days. After that, Trump will review U.S. economic conditions and decide whether it should be extended. Future extensions could potentially be longer than 60 days, Trump said this week.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKERS?
The executive order states that the administration will review all temporary visa programs - including guest worker programs - to determine if additional steps should be taken to protect U.S. workers.
A senior administration official told Reuters this week that the White House was considering a separate action that could deal with skilled workers who enter the country on H-1B visas and others affected by U.S. immigration policy.
DOES TRUMP HAVE THE POWER TO SUSPEND IMMIGRATION?
Trump’s latest immigration order draws on the same legal authority his administration cited in its 2017 travel ban that suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from seven majority-Muslim nations. While that policy cited security concerns, critics dubbed it a “Muslim ban.”
Federal judges blocked several iterations of the ban from taking effect, but the Supreme Court eventually upheld a reworked version of the measure in 2018 and it continues to be in force and was expanded in January.
Some legal experts argue the high court’s ruling does not permit a broad, worldwide ban on immigration into the United States and expect Trump’s latest order to be challenged in court.
WHAT DOES IMMIGRATION LOOK LIKE NOW?
The United States suspended routine visa services in most countries worldwide in mid-March due to the coronavirus outbreak, which was expected to dramatically slow legal immigration.
In addition, countries around the world have closed their borders and enacted quarantines to limit the spread of the virus, greatly reducing travel worldwide.
Amid the global slowdown, the number of permanent residency visas issued by the State Department fell to around 24,000 in March, a 35% decrease from the previous month, according to department statistics published on Thursday.
The number of temporary visas issued also decreased by roughly a third.
WOULD BLOCKING IMMIGRANTS HELP THE ECONOMY?
Trump said on Tuesday that an immigration suspension would protect U.S. workers, an extension of the message he employed during his 2016 presidential campaign.
However, researchers generally agree that immigration into the United States has actually stimulated economic growth, increased the size of the economy and created jobs, according to Giovanni Peri, an economics professor at the University of California, Davis.
“The idea that immigration threatens American jobs is just not there in any data,” he said."

She is a columnist for Dawn newspaper in Pakistan and The Baffler. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.
(CNN) At 10:06 p.m. EST on Monday, the lives of thousands of existing and would-be immigrants to the United States were suddenly thrown into further disarray in the midst of a global crisis. At that time, President Donald Trump tweeted that in order to ""protect the jobs of GREAT American citizens,"" he would be suspending immigration to the United States. On Tuesday evening, he provided further details , saying he would order a 60-day pause that would apply only to people seeking green cards to become permanent US residents. It was unclear whether temporary workers would be affected.
This imminent suspension of the issuance of work visas and green cards for employment-based immigrants shows -- among other things - how the Trump administration is planning to use the Covid-19 pandemic to further its agenda of severely limiting immigration to the United States.
In-person immigration processing had already been suspended owing to the virus, following the closure of consulates and United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) processing centers. However, the suspension of processing, which has been in place for several weeks, differs from the hold on green card applications that has just been announced by the President, in that it's a cessation based on policy desires and not pandemic-related closures. In the former case, those waiting for new visas and those whose H-1B visas were running out were given a 60 day period in which to file their claims. During that time, they could remain in the country. It now seems those temporary residents may not be affected immediately by the executive order. However, many of those visa holders would have been waiting to convert their status to permanent residency; the typical H1-B or O visa-holder who applies for a green card is very likely to be a skilled or talented professional who has lived and worked in the US for several years. With the President's announcement, those applicants for new visas will be thrown into chaos and may well have to leave.
In a statement following the President's Monday tweet, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany stated that the move was made to protect ""the health and economic well-being of Americans,"" a veiled but transparent reference to the virus -- though the United States has the highest number of cases globally. Her statement said further: ""Decades of record immigration had produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers.""
This White House line claiming that immigration hurts American citizens is incorrect. A National Bureau of Economic Research study, which looked at the impact of immigration on US workers between 1990-2004 (the years of highest immigration to the United States), found that the wages of American-born workers actually increased owing to immigration.
Beyond the mistruths offered to justify it, this action on immigration is likely to be yet another shock to the already flailing economy. Now suddenly US employers that were relying on talented employees being able to convert their status so they could remain in the US will face terrible uncertainty. Answering questions about the imminent order on Tuesday, President Trump said his first priority was ensuring American citizens had jobs.
The H-1B (or highly skilled worker) visa holders who are in line for green cards face the worst of this chaos; they could now lose their place in line and may have to leave the lives they have established in the US to return to their countries of origin. In an instant, their lives and futures have been upended and now hinge on the wording of the President's expected executive order.
The White House statement provides no information on how so many people will actually be removed from the United States in the coming months, when travel is limited and some borders are closed. One crucial question is how the sudden exit of so many middle-class temporary visa holders will affect the communities they live in, let alone the businesses they frequent or the faith communities they participate in. How many of these temporary visa holders are health workers who are desperately needed now? Unless the White House lifts the suspension or doesn't implement it at all, the country will likely be faced with the collective exodus of millions in the coming months.
They are easy victims. While temporary work visa holders can file cases in federal court challenging the President's order, they are in relatively weak legal positions. Visas are granted entirely at the discretion of the issuing government and are not subject to discrimination claims as would be the case if the petitioners were US citizens. US companies whose operations will be significantly destabilized by the order do have the ability to challenge the directive but that litigation, if it is ever filed, will likely take some time to make its way through the court system.
All of this will allow President Trump to win points with his largely immigrant-hating base. In the days before the President's tweet, right-wing groups were demanding an end to employment-based immigration. Earlier this month, US Tech Workers, a tech workers group that favors limiting immigration, posted a letter to President Trump asking him to suspend the yearly grant of 65,000 H-1B visas. A few days ago, former attorney general (and ex-Trump supporter) Jeff Sessions, long an anti-immigration hardliner, demanded that the President halt all employment-based immigration to the United States and ""put Americans and not foreign workers first"". This collective chorus, along with a push by Trump's de facto anti-immigrant czar Stephen Miller, have now all borne fruit, producing at the stroke of a tweet the most sweeping suggested transformation of the American immigration system in modern history.
Not only is the fallacy that immigrants reduce the wages of native-born Americans wrong, so too is the simplistic assumption that all jobs vacated by these workers will instantly be filled by a deserving native-born American. It is not only tech workers who hold temporary work visas, it is also professors, researchers doing highly specialized work, exceptionally talented writers, musicians and others. The work they do is not necessarily replicable or interchangeable and the jobs they do will likely not be filled after they leave. The intellectual cost of potentially losing their contributions, on the other hand, will not only set US innovation back by years, it will mean that research ventures will no longer want to locate their most crucial projects in the United States. Without the possibility of becoming US citizens, exceptionally gifted and talented immigrations, the ones eligible for ""O"" visas, may not want to bring their talents to us after all.

Such an action from the President would essentially render the America most of us know, long the nation of immigrants and home to innovation and diversity, unrecognizable. Even worse, the terribly high rates of unemployment that are likely to emerge out of the Covid-19 crisis will make it difficult for a potential Democratic President like Joe Biden to undo or easily unravel the disastrous impact of such an illogical move. The system of employment-based immigration that rewards technical expertise, hard work, research and artistic excellence is complex and interconnected -- far easier to destroy rather than to reconstruct.
As of now, it's still unclear what any executive order would look like or how feasible its immediate implementation would be. But one thing is crystal clear. Under the cover of attending to the employment impact of Covid-19, the Trump administration has initiated changes that could transform the way America looks and works and thinks for a long time to come."
4147,Just imagine if Trump had stopped immigration in early February',Washington Examiner,4/24/2020,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/just-imagine-if-trump-had-stopped-immigration-in-early-february,"President Trump announced Monday night that he plans to “temporarily suspend immigration” into the United States.
In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2020
There are tons of valid questions about the legality and the mechanism of this supposed suspension, and like many tweeted promises of Trump, this might never really happen.
Here’s my question: Given how fiercely Trump has always spoken about the threats from immigration, why did he not take earlier and stronger steps to close our borders and limit foreign travel into the country?
Yes, he issued a “travel ban” on China shortly after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global health emergency. But that has been porous. Reportedly, 40,000 people have entered the U.S. from China since then, and the original plan didn't put a special system in place to isolate returning Americans. Later, he issued European travel bans on March 11, but by then, the virus was already in the U.S. and spreading.
And yes, these restrictions were decried in the media as xenophobic, and those proposing travel bans earlier were called worse. Tom Cotton’s proposed travel ban in late January triggered a small rash of coronavirus-is-only-scary-if-you’re-racist pieces in the liberal media.
But if Trump were the guy he promised to be, and the guy the media often demonized him as being, he would have done a lot more, a lot earlier, on restricting entry in order to minimize invasion of the coronavirus.
Cotton, for instance, was calling for a ban on travel from China back on Jan. 22.
A week before, the first cases showed up outside of China, including in the U.S. What if, at that point (before the WHO declared it a global emergency), Trump had barred all entry from China? And what if when Europe started reporting deaths (Feb. 14 in France), Trump had simply closed off all entry into America?
By that point, only 12 cases had been identified in the U.S. It would have been an extreme step for Trump on Feb. 14 to ban all entry to the U.S. Of course, lots of complicated steps would have to be taken for U.S. citizens and residents who were traveling overseas, but imagine we started screening and even quarantining those few people that we allowed in. Taiwan did something like this.
Again, this is far stricter than anything any Western country has done, but Trump ran as an extraordinary immigration restrictionist.
Had Trump barred entry from China in late January (during impeachment) and then entry from every other country in mid-February, the media firestorm would have been immense.
Thanks to the Trump Effect (the magic power by which Trump controls the media’s opinion by driving them to declare the opposite of whatever he’s professing), we would have been bombarded with stories about how the virus wasn’t a big threat, China was containing it well, and Trump’s actions were counterproductive. More stories about Trump “sealing the U.S. off from the world"" and about how we would suffer from “leaving the global community.”
Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders would have reamed Trump for the shutdown. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would have held pro-immigration rallies.
And then, over the course of March, the coronavirus spread throughout Europe and Asia. But if we combined an entry ban with contact tracing and quarantining, we could have minimized the need for lockdowns and still greatly suppressed the spread of the virus.
So right about now, we might have the virus under control, while most of the rest of the world was in lockdown with death tolls climbing, and Trump would have owned the libs beyond his wildest dreams.
But Trump spent much of the winter watching his impeachment and saying nice things about China, in part because he wanted a trade deal. His travel bans were porous and late. It’s sort of the story of his whole administration: Trump crafts an image of himself as someone who will most divide the country (earning plaudits from his base and bile from the media), but he never lives up, or down, to that self-crafted image."
3719,"Trump says he will issue order to suspend immigration during coronavirus crisis, closing off the United States to a new extreme'",Washington Post,4/21/2020,,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/coronavirus-trump-immigration/2020/04/21/a2a465aa-837a-11ea-9728-c74380d9d410_story.html,"Trump, who is running for reelection on his immigration record and his effort to build a wall on the Mexico border, has long been frustrated with the limits on his ability to seal off the United States by decree. An executive order suspending all immigration to the country would take the president’s impulses to an untested extreme.
AD
AD
Two White House officials said an executive order is being drafted and that Trump could sign it as soon as Tuesday. The order, which was discussed among senior staff members Monday, would suspend nearly all immigration under the rationale of preventing the spread of infection by foreigners arriving from abroad.
The United States currently has more confirmed coronavirus cases, by far, than any other country, with more than 775,000; the next highest country is Spain, with 200,000 cases. The United States also has far more confirmed virus-related deaths — more than 42,000 — than any other nation; Italy has more than 24,000 deaths and Spain just fewer than 21,000.
It remains unclear what exceptions Trump could include in such a sweeping immigration order, or if would-be immigrants could reach the United States by demonstrating they are free of the virus. The White House officials said they thought the order would not be in place long-term.
AD
AD
The president’s announcement caught some senior Department of Homeland Security officials off guard, and the agency did not respond to questions and requests to explain Trump’s plan late Monday.
The United States already has placed broad restrictions on travel from Europe, China and other pandemic hot spots, while implementing strict controls at the country’s land borders. International air travel has plummeted.
Halting immigration to the United States ould affect hundreds of thousands of visa holders and other would-be green card recipients who are planning and preparing to come to the United States at any given time. Most of them are the family members of Americans.

In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2020
For Trump’s executive order to work, it would have to direct the State Department and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to immediately stop the issuance of immigration visas. Such a move appears to have no modern precedent and would potentially leave the fiancees, children and other close relatives of U.S. citizens in limbo.
AD
The State Department issued about 460,000 immigration visas last year, and USCIS processed nearly 580,000 green card approvals for foreigners who applied for permanent residency, the latest U.S. statistics show.
Alex Nowrasteh, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said that the president likely does have the authority to issue such an order during a time of crisis.
AD
Nowrasteh said there are at least two legal justifications for Trump to close the border to all immigration: Title 42 of the U.S. Code enables the president to halt immigration for health reasons, while a 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding his travel ban gives him legal precedent.
If such an order were in fact signed, it would be unprecedented in American history, Nowrasteh said. During the height of the 1918 flu pandemic, the United States allowed more than 110,000 immigrants to enter the country.
And during World War II, the United States accepted more than 170,000 immigrants with green cards and more than 227,000 temporary agricultural workers, mostly from Mexico, on the bracero guest worker visa program.
The president already has largely halted most forms of immigration into the United States, Nowrasteh said. This latest move continues his restrictionist immigration policies and takes them to a new level, using the pandemic as the reasoning.
AD
AD
On March 18, the State Department canceled most routine immigrant and nonimmigrant visa appointments at its offices overseas, effectively shutting down almost all new kinds of travel into the United States. The State Department also stopped all processing for refugee resettlement.
Later that week, however, authorities resumed processing H-2A visas for seasonal guest workers. The country's agricultural laborers have been officially declared “essential workers,” including hundreds of thousands of people who enter the country under that temporary visa.
Nowrasteh said he was surprised that it took Trump so long to use the pandemic and the cause of public health as justification to achieve one of his highest policy priorities.
AD
“The president has been opposed to legal immigration for his entire administration,” he said. “This is an opportunity to close it down entirely, and this is about as legitimate as you can get in terms of a broad justification for doing so.”
AD
Trump already has cited the health emergency to enact the kind of enforcement measures at the U.S. border with Mexico he has long extolled, moves that have essentially closed the border to asylum seekers and waved off anti-trafficking protections for underage migrants. During the past few weeks of the coronavirus crisis, U.S. border authorities have expelled 10,000 border crossers in an average of just a little more than an hour and a half each, which has effectively emptied out U.S. Border Patrol holding facilities of detainees.
U.S. border authorities say the measures are in place to help federal agents, health-care workers and the public by preventing potentially infected migrants from crossing into the United States, while minimizing the population of detainees in U.S. immigration jails.

2730,U.S. coronavirus response deepens divide as Trump suspends immigration',Reuters,4/21/2020,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/u-s-coronavirus-response-deepens-divide-as-trump-suspends-immigration-idUSKCN2231TU,"ATLANTA (Reuters) - Governors of about half a dozen U.S. states pushed ahead on Tuesday with plans to partially reopen for business despite warnings by some health officials that doing so could trigger a new surge in coronavirus cases.
The easing of sweeping restrictions in Georgia, South Carolina and other mostly Southern U.S. states follows protests against rules imposed during the pandemic that shut down businesses and largely confined residents to their homes.
A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll showed a majority of Americans believed stay-at-home orders should remain in place until public health officials determine lifting them is safe, despite the damage to the U.S. economy.
“It’s a matter of concern, this whole idea of opening up. It’s based on non-science generated parameters,” Dr. Boris Lushniak, dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Health, told Reuters in an interview.
Deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by coronavirus, topped 45,150 nationwide as cases climbed to over 810,000, according to a Reuters tally.
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan each reported their highest single-day coronavirus-related death tolls - over 800 between the three states. New York state, the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, reported 481 new deaths.
Governors are under pressure from businesses and some constituents to relax stay-at-home orders that have thrown over 20 million people out of work in the past month alone.
In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers who filed a lawsuit against Democratic Governor Tony Evers, challenging his stay-at-home order that runs until May 26.
CDC WARNS OF FALL OUTBREAK
Tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, and local officials have risen over the U.S. government’s role in ramping up testing, which infectious disease experts say is key to enable a safe reopening.
Those experts say the United States, with a population of nearly 330 million people, should test 3 million per week to get an accurate sense of the virus’s reach. States have tested only a third of that number in the past seven days, according to the Covid Tracking Project.
Even as states move ahead with plans to reopen, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned a second wave of the coronavirus could be worse if it coincides with the start of seasonal flu season.
“There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,” CDC Director Robert Redfield said in an interview with The Washington Post.
Georgia is among a half dozen states that will allow more business activity this week or next.
Brian Kemp, Georgia’s Republican governor, will allow gyms, hair salons, bowling alleys, tattoo and massage parlors to reopen on Friday, followed by movie houses and restaurants next week.
Kemp said his plan balances public health with the need to reignite the state’s economy, saying social distancing rules would remain in place.

Georgia has reported 174 positive cases and six deaths per 100,000 people, both below the national average, according to a Reuters analysis of data collected by the Covid Tracking Project.But the state also has one of the lowest testing rates, giving health officials less data on the reach of the illness to base decisions on reopening, the data showed.
“Don’t go out,” Savannah Mayor Van Johnson, a Democrat, told residents of the eastern Georgia city during a news conference. “People will not come here if they think our businesses are not safe.”
CUOMO MEETS TRUMP
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo emerged from a meeting with Trump at the White House and said the president had agreed to help his state procure chemical reagents and other supplies needed to double testing capacity.
Cuomo said it was up to his state to help labs boost their testing capacity and to organize the workers needed to take more samples.
“That is an intelligent division of labor,” Cuomo said at a press briefing. “Let each level of government do what it does best.”
The governor said New York would try to double the number of people it tests each day - including diagnostic and antibody tests - to 40,000, characterizing the task as an “enormous undertaking” that would take weeks.
Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom of California, the most populous U.S. state, said despite evidence the outbreak was slowing there, cases and deaths were still rising.
Over the seven-day period ending on Sunday night, the number of deaths in California nearly doubled, and the number of new cases increased by nearly 50%, state data showed.

Newsom promised to release a detailed plan for testing and reopening on Wednesday, but cautioned it was too soon to loosen public health restrictions.
In Washington, D.C., the U.S. Senate unanimously approved $484 billion in additional coronavirus relief for the U.S. economy and hospitals treating patients sickened by the pandemic, sending the measure to the House of Representatives for final passage later this week.

Sign up here.
UPDATE, April 21, 2020 at 6:58 p.m. ET : President Trump has clarified that his 60-day immigration pause, at least for now, will apply only to people seeking permanent residence in the United States.
Original story below:
President Trump announced late Monday he will soon sign an executive order ""to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States,"" in what appeared to be a drastic escalation of his efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic and boost the economy.
The declaration came hours after U.S. equity markets plunged, with oil prices turning negative for the first time in history. Also on Monday, three states -- Georgia, Tennessee, and South Carolina -- revealed plans to begin reopening some businesses.
""In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!"" the president tweeted.
The precise contours of the president's planned executive order were not immediately clear. The White House did not immediately elaborate on Trump's tweeted announcement.
Politico reported that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was still working out the details of the executive order, and that an exemption for temporary guest workers, including farm workers, was under consideration.
A top DHS official told the outlet that “22 million unemployed Americans and counting due to COVID-19"" had prompted Trump to act.
Due to the pandemic, almost all visa processing by the State Department, including immigrant visas, has been suspended for weeks.
Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Arizona, applauded the planned executive order, and suggested a total immigration suspension should continue indefinitely. ""Thank you, @realDonaldTrump!"" he wrote. ""All immigration to the United States should halt until every American who wants a job has one!""
""Given tens of millions of Americans are out of work right now and we’re battling a virus that spreads through human-to-human transmission I am dying to hear one coherent argument against this,"" wrote Spectator USA's Washington editor Amber Athey.
Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., meanwhile, said Trump was looking for ""someone to blame for his own failure.""
CORONAVIRUS TIMELINE SHOWS MULTIPLE FLIP-FLOPS BY JOURNOS, DEMS, GOP
""Immigration has nearly stopped and the US has far more cases than any other country,"" Beyer wrote, without adjusting his statistic to consider the larger population in the United States. ""This is just xenophobic scapegoating.""
Added Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.: ""Trump failed to take this crisis seriously from day 1. His abandonment of his role as president has cost lives. And now, he's shamelessly politicizing this pandemic to double down on his anti-immigrant agenda. Enough, Mr. President. The American people are fed up.""
Aside from the pending immigration ban, the U.S. has already enacted a slew of entry restrictions. The U.S. recently agreed with both Canada and Mexico to extend border restrictions on nonessential travel for another 30 days, through May 16 and May 19, respectively.
However, people with temporary work visas, students and business travelers were exempted, along with emergency personnel.
The president has also already has blocked most travel from other hotspots, including most of Europe, Iran, South Korea, and China.
AOC CELEBRATES OIL CRASH IN NOW-DELETED TWEET
More than 750,000 Americans have come down with COVID-19 and more than 42,000 have died. On Monday, the U.S. government said it will continue to quickly expel migrants it encounters along the border with Mexico for at least another month in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.
Under the U.S. policy change spurred by the virus, the U.S. government has sent some 10,000 Mexicans and Central Americans back to Mexico, according to data from the U.S.Border Patrol.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) says that more than 100 migrants at 25 detention centers have tested positive for COVID-19. Guatemala claims that 44 migrants deported from the U.S. tested positive.
Monday's immigration suspension was likely to draw legal challenges, and reignite an already heated debate over travel restrictions. On Jan. 31, Trump issued the ""Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus,"" blocking most travel from China -- and at the time, Democrats harshly criticized the move.
Within hours, Joe Biden campaigned in Iowa and told the crowd that Americans “need to have a president who they can trust what he says about it, that he is going to act rationally about it. ... This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia – hysterical xenophobia – and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.”
Months later, Biden said he supported the China travel ban.

2314,"Court hands Trump win in sanctuary city fight, says administration can deny grant money'",Fox News (Online),2/26/2020,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/court-hands-trump-win-in-sanctuary-city-grant,"A federal appeals court on Wednesday handed a major win to the Trump administration in its fight against “sanctuary” jurisdictions, ruling that it can deny grant money to states that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.
The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York overturned a lower court ruling that stopped the administration’s 2017 move to withhold grant money from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, which dispenses over $250 million a year to state and local criminal justice efforts.
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO DEPLOY BORDER PATROL TO SANCTUARY CITIES TO HELP ICE CATCH ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
“Today’s decision rightfully recognizes the lawful authority of the Attorney General to ensure that Department of Justice grant recipients are not at the same time thwarting federal law enforcement priorities,” a DOJ spokesman said in a statement. “The grant conditions here require states and cities that receive DOJ grants to share information about criminals in custody. The federal government uses this information to enforce national immigration laws--policies supported by successive Democrat and Republican administrations.”
“All Americans will benefit from increased public safety as this Administration is able to implement its lawful immigration and public safety policies,” the statement said.
The latest decision conflicts with rulings from other appeals courts across the country concerning sanctuary policies, indicating a Supreme Court review is ultimately likely.
New York City and liberal states including New York, Washington, Massachusetts and Connecticut sued the government, and the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York backed them — ordering the money be released and stopping the government from putting immigration-related conditions on grants.
But the appeals court ruled that it “cannot agree that the federal government must be enjoined from imposing the challenged conditions on the federal grants here at issue.”
“These conditions help the federal government enforce national immigration laws and policies supported by successive Democratic and Republican administrations,” the court ruled. “But more to the authorization point, they ensure that applicants satisfy particular statutory grant requirements imposed by Congress and subject to Attorney General oversight.”
It also disagreed with the district court’s claim that the conditions intrude on powers reserved only to states, noting that in immigration policy the Supreme Court has found that the federal government maintains “broad” and “preeminent” power.
The ruling marks a key win for the administration in its efforts to crack down on the continued use of “sanctuary” policies that limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities in order to shield illegal immigrants from deportation.
ICE SUBPOENAS NY FOR INFO ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ACCUSED OF MURDER, AS SANCTUARY CITY FIGHT ESCALATES
The Heritage Foundation’s Mike Howell, a former member of Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Legal Counsel, told Fox News that the ruling is potentially an important development considering the dependence of states like New York on DOJ grant money.
“When you look at the amount of money that flows in via grants generally, the federal government has a lot of power over states and localities,” he said. “If you open the door to the federal government being able to condition that grant money, it’s a huge deal.”
Sanctuary policies generally forbid local law enforcement from honoring detainers -- requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that they be alerted to of an illegal immigrant’s release from custody so they can be be picked up by ICE and put through deportation proceedings.
Proponents of the policies claim it makes cities safer because it encourages illegal immigrants to cooperate with police without fear of deportation. But the Trump administration has been relentlessly pushing back by highlighting cases in which criminals are released onto the streets only to re-offend.
It has also deployed a series of measures to combat the practice, including deploying elite Border Patrol agents to sanctuary cities to help ICE track down and detain illegal immigrants.

The Justice Department recently announced a slew of measures, and President Trump has called on Congress to pass legislation that would allow victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants to sue sanctuary cities and states.
“Not one more American life should be stolen by sanctuary cities; they’re all over the place and a lot of people don’t want them,” Trump said at the State of the Union address this month.

5410,Court rules Trump administration can withhold funds from sanctuary cities',Axios,2/26/2020,,,https://www.axios.com/court-trump-immigration-sanctuary-cities-565ee05c-46ea-4894-8e1b-52f6a0fde7c8.html,"The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration can withhold millions of dollars in federal law enforcement grants from sanctuary cities and states that don't cooperate with immigration enforcement, AP reports.
The state of play: Seven states and New York City sued the U.S. government after the Justice Department said in 2017 it would withhold funds from cities and states that don't give immigration enforcement officials access to jails or notice when an undocumented migrant is scheduled to be released from jail, per AP.
The big picture: The decision conflicts with the rulings of three other federal appeals courts and comes amid an ongoing dispute between the Trump administration and sanctuary cities, which restrict cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration officials.
The Department of Homeland Security recently suspended New York residents from enrolling in Global Entry and other Trusted Traveler Programs because of a state law preventing federal immigration officials from accessing vehicle records without a court order.
Between the lines: While this is an important win for the Trump administration, it likely can't begin acting on the decision yet because of nationwide injunctions in other cases.

3784,Administration to Divert Billions From Pentagon to Fund Border Wall',New York Times (Online News),2/14/2020,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/us/politics/border-wall-funds-pentagon.html,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon plans to divert $3.8 billion intended for military equipment to the construction of a wall at the southwestern border, it informed lawmakers on Thursday, drawing bipartisan outrage and reviving a long-running battle with Congress over funding for President Trump’s signature campaign promise.
The formal notification to Congress on Thursday, which was obtained by The New York Times, was the latest bid by Mr. Trump’s administration to circumvent congressional control of federal spending and unilaterally seize funds that lawmakers had designated for other purposes to finance the construction of the wall. The move came on the same day that Mr. Trump confirmed that the national emergency he had declared almost exactly a year ago to allow him to take money Congress had allocated for other purposes and spend it on the border wall would remain in place for another year.
The Pentagon’s decision to divert funds was greeted on Thursday with criticism by a few prominent members of Mr. Trump’s party, who joined Democrats in saying the president’s team had overstepped its constitutional authority by second-guessing congressional spending decisions.
“Once those choices have been made, the Department of Defense cannot change them in pursuit of their own priorities without the approval of Congress,” said Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee. “Attempts to do so undermines the principle of civilian control of the military and is in violation of the separation of powers within the Constitution.”"
4048,"Trump\xe2\x80\x99s plan to strip planes, ships, and vehicles from Pentagon budget to fund border wall draws bipartisan howls of protest from Congress'",Washington Examiner,2/14/2020,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/trumps-plan-to-strip-planes-ships-and-vehicles-from-pentagon-budget-to-fund-border-wall-draws-bipartisan-howls-of-protest-from-congress,"ASKING NEITHER FORGIVENESS NOR PERMISSION: In an audacious challenge to legislative branch’s power of the purse, the Trump administration has notified Congress it intends to take $3.8 billion from major weapons programs, warfighting funds, and the National Guard to pay for construction of hundreds of miles of additional border wall before the November election.
The reprogramming action sent to Capitol Hill yesterday cites the urgent need to deter drug smuggling across the southern border — not stopping illegal immigration — as an “unforeseen military requirement,” which it argues is “necessary in the national interest.”
BIPARTISAN OUTRAGE: The notification that the Pentagon was unilaterally eliminating planes, ships, vehicles and other equipment — that in many cases Congress had added to the president’s original FY 2020 budget — touched off an explosion of outrage, even among some Republicans who support funding for the border wall.
“Congress has the constitutional responsibility to determine how defense dollars are spent. We take the Pentagon’s recommendations seriously during our deliberations, but the final decisions are contained in the bills passed by Congress and signed into law. Once those choices have been made, the Department of Defense cannot change them in pursuit of their own priorities without the approval of Congress,” said Texas Republican Mac Thornberry, ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee. “The re-programming announced today is contrary to Congress’s constitutional authority.”
Committee Chairman Adam Smith accused President Trump of being “obsessed with fulfilling a campaign promise at the expense of our national security.”
“This Administration has already stolen billions from the Department of Defense in order to begin building the President’s vanity wall and today they are doubling down on bad policy,” Smith said in a statement. “The President loves to take credit for ‘rebuilding’ the military, but today’s reprogramming decision does the exact opposite – it will prevent the acquisition of critical ships, vehicles, and aircraft.”
“Rather than investing in the procurement of critical platforms, this administration would rather dump another $3.8 billion into a wall on our southern border,” Smith said. “It is clear to me, and anyone with experience in national security policy, that a wall on our southern border will do nothing to support our strategic advantage over Russia and China, support counterterrorism, address rogue states, or enhance relations with partners and allies.”
THE HIT LIST: Here are the cuts the Pentagon wants to make to come up with wall money, along with the military services and defense contractors who would be affected.
2 Marine Corps F-35B Lockheed Martin Joint Strike Fighters — $223 million
2 Marine Corps V-22 Boeing Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft — $155 million
4 Air Force C-130J Lockheed Martin Super Hercules Cargo planes — $365 million
8 Air Force MQ-9 General Atomics Reaper Drones — $160 million
1 Navy P-8A Boeing Poseidon maritime patrol planes — $180 million
1 Navy LHA-9 Huntington Ingalls Amphibious Assault ship — $650 million
1 Navy EPF Austal USA Expeditionary Fast Transport Ship — $261 million
Army AM General Humvees and other vehicles — $201 million
Funding for Air Force OA-X Light Attack Aircraft program — $180 million
Unspecified National Guard and Reserve equipment: — $1.3 billion
THE JUSTIFICATION: In most cases the Pentagon argued the axed weapons programs were in “excess” or “early” to “current programmatic need,” and were “a congressional special interest item.” Translation: the planes, ships, and vehicles are not needed, or at least not needed now, and in some cases were added by Congress to benefit districts with defense contractors or military bases.
The programing notification cites “general transfer authority” and “special transfer authority” in the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act as the legal basis for not needing approval from Congress to shift the funds into the Pentagon’s counterdrug account, where they can be used for wall construction.
Previously the Pentagon acted under the 1976 National Emergencies Act, which limits the transfer of funds to the total of funds that have been appropriated for military construction that have not been obligated.
GUARD STUNG: The cuts are a bitter pill for the Guard, which has been historically underfunded, says retired Brig. Gen. J. Roy Robinson, president of the National Guard Association of the U.S.
The Guard and Reserve took the biggest hit, $1.8 million dollars in weapons and equipment.
“While technically ‘congressional add-ons’ to the president's formal budget request, the funds were intended to purchase unfunded requirements and are the product of longstanding programs in the annual defense budget process,” said the association in response to the cuts.
""Any inference that these aren't critical needs for the Guard is false,"" Robinson said. ""This is just the Guard being used as a convenient bill-payer.""
The association outlined its concerns in a letter to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley.
WAR POWERS: Eight Republican senators joined Democrats in an effort to claw back from the executive branch the final say on waging war, providing the winning margin in a 55 to 45 vote to require President Trump seek congressional authorization before taking further military action against Iran.
The Republicans who supported the resolution drafted by Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine are Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Mike Lee of Utah, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Todd Young of Indiana.
""For me this debate is not about party. I have supported the Constitutional mandate that Congress must declare war under both Democrat and Republican Presidents and I will continue,” Paul tweeted. “For me this debate is not a dry and esoteric debate, it is a debate about life and death.”
“The president always has the ability to defend the United States against imminent attack. And we would not change that. The president needs that power. We're not tying the president's hands,” said Kaine on CNN. “We are just saying, war is the most serious thing that we do. It should only be done after serious deliberation. No one person should make the decision on their own.”
The measure fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a promised veto by President Trump.

HAPPENING TODAY: Everyone who is anyone in national security circles is in Germany today for the 56th annual Munich Security Conference, widely considered the world’s leading forum for international security policy. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are there, along with a bipartisan delegation of 21 members of Congress headed by Sen. Lindsay Graham, who took over the mantle from the late Sen. John McCain.
Mingling with the more than 500 heads of state, top diplomats, senior military officials from around the world, is the Washington Examiner’s own Joel Gehrke, who offers the following observations from Munich:
“The conference provides a high-profile forum for government decision-makers, former officials, and analysts to give speeches, participate in panel discussions, or even just rub elbows. Sometimes the elbows are quite sharp,” says Gehke, who is a veteran in covering the who’s who? of “the political West.”
“The Munich Security Conference is not merely think-tank nirvana. It’s a place for allies, partners, and adversaries gather to lay down public markers and hold private meetings about local hotspots and global foreign policy trends alike,” Gehrke says.
A FEELING OF ‘WESTLESSNESS’: if you haven’t heard the term before, you’ll hear it a lot this weekend. The idea that the world is becoming less Western, is the subject of a report that is a theme of this year’s conference.
“More importantly, the West itself may become less Western, too,” the report says. “The contemporary ‘spiritual disunity of the West’ is due to the rise of an illiberal and nationalist camp within the Western world.”
The report authors regard President Trump among those disintegrating forces, given his stated hostility to “globalists.” They continue to lament the United Kingdom’s “painful long goodbye” from the European Union. Brexit has altered the balance of power within the EU and French President Emmanuel Macron, some observers suspect, sees an opportunity to enhance the political influence of Paris while taking a half-step away from Washington.
THE US TAG TEAM: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo can be expected to dispute the idea that President Trump’s presence in the White House undermines transatlantic security in his Saturday morning speech “about the West and the West’s role in the world.” Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper are both likely to renew their warnings that Europe should beware of China’s ambitions for economic and political influence on the continent.
CEASEFIRE LIGHT: Before departing NATO headquarters in Brussels yesterday, Esper announced a week-long “sort-of” ceasefire that is hoped to be the first step on the long road to peace in Afghanistan.
“The United States and the Taliban have negotiated a proposal for a seven-day reduction in violence. I'm here today consulting with allies about this proposal and we've had a series of productive bilateral and collective meetings about the path forward,” Esper said, giving few details.
“We've said all along that the best, if not only, solution in Afghanistan is a political agreement,” he added. “Progress has been made on this front and we'll have more to report on that soon I hope.”
Asked if seven days were enough time to judge the sincerity of the Taliban’s pledge to reduce violence, Esper replied, “It is our view that seven days, for now, is sufficient,” but added, “Our approach to this process will be conditions-based ... So it will be a continual evaluative process, as we go forward, if we go forward.”
“We have the basis for one on the table. We are taking a hard look at it. We are consulting with our allies. We are consulting with Congress and others,” Esper said. “And I think peace deserves a chance. But it will demand that all parties comply with their obligations.”
POMPEO: ‘REAL PROGRESS’: Speaking to reporters on his plane en route to the Munich Security Conference, Pompeo insisted the agreement represented “real progress” in talks with the Taliban.
“We hope we can get to the place where we can get a significant reduction in violence – not only on a piece of paper, but demonstrated in the capability to actually deliver a serious reduction of violence in Afghanistan,” Pompeo. “And if we can get there and we can hold that posture for a while, we may well be able to begin the real serious discussion, which is all the Afghans sitting at a table, finding a true reconciliation path forward.”
CASUALTY COUNT: The Pentagon says another soldier has died in Afghanistan, this time from a non-combat incident, which usually means accident, suicide, or sometimes homicide.
The death Wednesday brings to five the number of U.S. troops who have lost their lives in Afghanistan this year. The soldier was identified as Spc. Branden Tyme Kimball, 21, from Central Point, Oregon, assigned to 3rd Battalion, 10th Aviation Regiment, 10th Combat Aviation Brigade, Fort Drum, New York.
Last year in Afghanistan 21 U.S. troops died, 19 in combat and two in what was described by the Pentagon as non-combat incidents, according to a count by the Washington Examiner.
So far this year five U.S. troops have died, four in combat. Two Green Berets were shot In Feb. 8 in a suspected insider attack, and two 82nd Airborne soldiers who were killed Jan. 11, when a roadside bomb struck their vehicle while on patrol.
INDUSTRY WATCH: HEY, HEY, YOU, YOU, GET OFF THAT CLOUD: A judge on the Court of Federal Claims has granted an injunction ordering a halt to work on the Pentagon’s cloud computing network as the court considers Amazon’s allegation that President Trump improperly influenced the bidding process for the network’s contract.
The Defense Department awarded the contract, valued at up to $10 billion, to Microsoft in October to build the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, network. Amazon is suing, seeking testimony from Trump and a handful of current and former top defense officials, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper, former Defense Secretary James Mattis.
""We are disappointed in today's ruling and believe the actions taken in this litigation have unnecessarily delayed implementing DoD's modernization strategy and deprived our warfighters of a set of capabilities they urgently need,” said Lt. Col, Robert Carver, a Pentagon spokesman. “However, we are confident in our award of the JEDI Cloud contract to Microsoft and remain focused on getting this critical capability into the hands of our warfighters as quickly and efficiently as possible.""
STARS AND STRIPES JUST DIDN’T MAKE THE CUT: In the end Secretary Esper’s attack on the fourth estate — which the Pentagon defines as the 50 DoD organizations and bureaucracy not directly related to warfighting — end up affecting the traditional fourth estate, journalism.
Esper defense wide review combed through $100 billion worth of programs looking for money that could be better spent elsewhere. Esper yesterday defended his decision to cut $7 million from Stars and Stripes, the Pentagon owned newspaper that has provided independent reporting to the troops since the Civil War.
“At the end of the day, that was not a priority that met the cut line,” Esper said. “And so we trimmed that support for Stars and Stripes because we need to invest that money, as we did with many, many, many other programs, into higher-priority issues.”
If the paper is to survive it will have to rely on subscriptions and advertising.

MUNICH, Germany (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Friday defended his decision to divert billions of dollars in funding for Navy and Air Force aircraft and other military programs to help pay for President Donald Trump’s promised wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.
Esper was asked by a reporter about criticism from Democrats and Republicans in Congress, including Rep. Mac Thornberry, a Republican from Texas, who called the diversion of funds contrary to the constitutional authority of Congress.
“Border security is national security,” Esper said, “and national security is our mission.”

He added, “The action we took is legal under the law, and so it should be no surprise, and I’ll just leave it at that for now.”
Esper spoke on the sidelines of an international security conference in Munich.
The Pentagon announced on Thursday that Esper approved shifting $3.8 billion in funds that Congress had previously authorized for F-35 fighter aircraft and other military programs. The money is being diverted to help the Department of Homeland Security build portions of the border wall. The Pentagon indicated that more such actions could be coming to provide additional funding for Trump’s signature campaign promise.
The action drew sharp rebukes from Democrats as well as Republicans.
“Today’s reprogramming request confirms once again that the President is obsessed with fulfilling a campaign promise at the expense of our national security,” Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. “This administration has already stolen billions from the Department of Defense in order to begin building the president’s vanity wall and today they are doubling down on bad policy.”
Last year, despite congressional opposition, Trump faced no consequences when making similar transfers by cancelling or postponing dozens of military construction projects to free up $3.6 billion .
In reaction to Thursday’s Pentagon announcement, Thornberry, the top Republican on the committee and a supporter of wall construction, said that while the administration’s constitutional role is to recommend how tax dollars are spent, final choices are made by Congress.
“Once those choices have been made, the Department of Defense cannot change them in pursuit of their own priorities without the approval of Congress,” he said. “Attempts to do so undermines the principle of civilian control of the military and is in violation of the separation of powers within the Constitution. The re-programming announced today is contrary to Congress’ constitutional authority, and I believe that it requires Congress to take action.”
Trump, while campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, repeatedly promised that Mexico would pay for the wall , but Mexico refused."
5005,US travel ban: Trump restricts immigration from Nigeria and five other countries',BBC News,2/1/2020,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51335011,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US issued more than 8,000 immigration visas to Nigerians in 2018
The US has announced it is expanding its curbs on immigration to include six more countries, including Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation.
Citizens from Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Kyrgyzstan and Myanmar will now be blocked from obtaining certain types of visas.
People from those countries will still be able to visit the US as tourists.
In 2018 the US issued twice as many immigration visas to Nigeria than to the other five nations combined.
An official said the new measures were the result of failures by the six countries to meet US security and information-sharing standards.
""These countries, for the most part, want to be helpful but for a variety of different reasons simply failed to meet those minimum requirements that we laid out,"" acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf told reporters on Friday.
He said officials would work with the countries on bolstering their security requirements to help them get off the list.
US President Donald Trump first introduced a travel ban in 2017. It currently closes US borders to citizens from seven countries, most of them with Muslim majorities.
In 2018 the US issued more than 8,000 immigration visas to citizens of Nigeria. That same year, just over 2,000 were issued to Sudanese nationals, 290 to Tanzanians, and just 31 to Eritreans.
The US had previously announced a ban on certain types of visas for Eritreans in 2017.
What are the new rules?
The US said it would suspend the issuance of visas that can lead to permanent residency for nationals of Nigeria, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, and Myanmar.
Sudanese and Tanzanian nationals will no longer be allowed to apply for ""diversity visas"", which are available by lottery for applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the US.
Mr Wolf said non-immigrant visas given to people for temporary stays - including visitors, those doing business or people seeking medical treatment - would not be impacted by the new rules.
Of the new nationalities facing visa restrictions, Nigerians account for the most immigration to the US.
According to US government statistics, the State Department issued 8,018 immigrant visas to Nigerians in the fiscal year 2018.
Kyrgyzstan and Sudan have large Muslim majorities, while around 50% of people in Nigeria and Eritrea are Muslim. Tanzania also has a sizable Muslim community.
What is the travel ban?
Mr Trump signed a controversial travel ban just seven days after taking office in January 2017, arguing it was vital to protect Americans.
The ban initially excluded people from seven majority-Muslim countries but the list was modified following a series of court challenges.
It now restricts citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Venezuela and North Korea.
While the government has suspended most immigrant and non-immigrant visas to applicants from those countries, exceptions are available for students and those with ""significant contacts"" in the US."
2539,Trump expands travel ban to six new countries',Washington Times,2/1/2020,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jan/31/trump-expands-travel-ban-six-new-countries/,"President Trump signed an order Friday expanding his travel ban to six new countries, targeting nations the government says pose a threat because they don’t issue electronic passports or don’t do enough to share information with American authorities to vet their citizens looking to travel.
The six countries are Burma, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania. They join seven countries who are still part of the president’s previous travel ban: Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.
“It is fundamental to national security, and the height of common sense, that if a foreign nation wishes to receive the benefits of immigration and travel to the United States, it must satisfy basic security conditions outlined by America’s law-enforcement and intelligence professionals,” said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.
The new countries aren’t subject to a total ban.
Only immigrant applications from Burma, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan and Nigeria will be blocked, while other travelers are not affected. For Sudan and Tanzania, only applicants under the diversity visa program will be blocked, a Homeland Security official said.
That means businesses can still bring in temporary workers and family members can still visit relatives here.
The official said the lower level of ban reflects the countries’ conditions.
“These six countries have a greater prospect of making improvements,” the official said.
The additional ban will take effect Feb. 22, so nobody traveling now will be affected, nor will those who already have visas. Anyone already in the U.S. is unaffected, too.
Based on past trends, Homeland Security said perhaps 12,000 people would be affected by the expanded ban.
Immigrant-rights groups complained that the expanded ban could harm vulnerable people.
“We are particularly concerned about Burmese refugees who may see America’s doors closed to them at a time of desperate need — including thousands of ethnic Chin, Karen, and Muslim Rohingya, who have fled severe persecution,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service
Government officials said refugees are not affected.
Mr. Trump issued his first travel ban Jan. 27, 2017, on seven majority-Muslim countries, virtually banning all entry of citizens from those countries.
That derided as a “Muslim ban,” and was halted by federal judges.
Mr. Trump would make two subsequent revisions to narrow the ban and alter the countries covered, deleting some of the original nations and adding in two non-Muslim nations, North Korea and Venezuela.
The Supreme Court in 2018 ruled that version of the ban was legal on its face — though it left room for challenges on how the ban was carried out. Those challenges are still making their way through lower courts.
Homeland Security officials defended the new additions to the list, saying they were added after an extensive review of every country’s vulnerabilities and willingness to share information with the U.S. so that their citizens looking to travel to the U.S. can be properly vetted.
“DHS and the Department of State have informed each of the six countries about their specific deficiencies,” a Homeland Security official said, adding that countries can earn their way off the list by improving their cooperation.
That happened in April 2018 when Chad made enough improvements to be dropped from the travel ban, the official said.

2125,"Trump's expanded travel ban: Which countries are affected?""",Al Jazeera,2/1/2020,,,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/trump-expanded-travel-ban-countries-affected-200131212513800.html,"US President Donald Trump has expanded his controversial travel ban, often referred to by critics as a Muslim ban, to target citizens from six additional countries.
The move on Friday was slammed by immigrant advocates and critics who say the policy discriminates against Muslims and others.
More:
The announcement comes three years after Trump sparked outrage by signing an executive order suspending immigration from several Muslim-majority countries. That travel ban, which caused chaos and protests at airports, was challenged in the courts and eventually amended to target five Muslim-majority countries - Yemen, Syria, Iran, Libya and Somalia - as well put restrictions on nationals from Venezuela and North Korea.
The Trump administration maintains that the six additional countries - Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania - failed to meet US security and information-sharing standards, which necessitated the new restrictions. The problems officials cited ranged from subpar passport technology to a failure to sufficiently exchange information on ""terrorism"" suspects and criminals. The restrictions on the six new countries will take effect on February 21.
Here is a look at which countries are included in the expanded travel ban and what restrictions have been put in place.
Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar and Nigeria
The United States will suspend the issuance of visas that can lead to permanent residency for nationals of Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar and Nigeria, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf said on Friday.
Non-immigrant visas will not be affected. According to the State Department, non-immigrant visas include those for tourism, short-term business, medical purposes, education, and journalism, among other types of visas.
During December, for example, about 650,760 non-immigrant visas were granted worldwide.
Immigrant visas include those for spouses, certain family members, certain sponsored employment and other purposes.
The Trump administration said there are exceptions to the restrictions.
Sudan and Tanzania
The US government will also stop issuing ""diversity visas"" to nationals of Sudan and Tanzania, according to a presidential proclamation.
These visas - which Trump has criticised in the past - are available by lottery for applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the US.
The State Department uses a computer drawing to select people from around the world for up to 55,000 diversity visas. Nigeria is already excluded from the lottery along with other countries that had more than 50,000 natives immigrate to the US in the previous five years.

Yemen, Syria, Iran, Somalia and Libya
The existing version of the ban includes the Muslim-majority nations of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. North Korea and Venezuela also face visa restrictions, but those measures affect relatively few travellers.
The current ban suspends immigrant and non-immigrant visas to applicants from the affected countries, but it allows exceptions, including for students and those who have established ""significant contacts"" in the US.
These restrictions will remain in place, the proclamation said.
North Korea and Venezuela
Most North Koreans are barred from entering the US.
The Venezuelan ban mostly affects government officials and their family members."
3558,A Barrier to Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Border Wall: Landowners in Texas',New York Times (Online News),12/26/2019,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/26/us/politics/trump-border-wall.html,"“They’re going to acquire the land for their wall, whether you negotiate with them upfront or they end up filing a lawsuit and taking it by a declaration of taking,” said Roy Brandys, a lawyer specializing in eminent domain who represented Mr. Drawe.
Adding to the heartache is where the wall is actually going. The construction is not on the border, which runs along the Rio Grande. It is well within the American side.
Mr. Drawe will lose easy access to the land between the wall and the river — about 350 of his 525 acres. The government has agreed to pay him about $42,000 for the 12 acres that the wall will be built on and about $197,000 to compensate for depressing the value of his farm, Mr. Drawe said. Gates are supposed to provide access to his property south of the wall.
By Mr. Drawe’s reckoning, that might be of limited value. He has found packages of drugs on his farm before, he said, and is concerned that the cartel members that Mr. Trump cites as the reason for the construction will take control of all the land south of the wall.
“If the wall goes up,” Mr. Drawe said, “it will be the new border.”
Becky Jones is preparing for a fight. The Trump administration recently sent Ms. Jones, 69, and her family a letter saying that it was preparing to take them to court if they did not allow the government to survey their farmland for border wall construction.
For Ms. Jones, the construction undercuts language in Congress’s 2019 spending bill that said land within the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge adjacent to her property would be exempt from the wall. She said the construction, which will run on the road alongside the refuge, will harm the wildlife she grew up admiring."

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf visited a construction site in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas on a windswept day last month and repeated a Trump administration pledge.
""We are on track to build 450 to 500 miles of new wall by the end of 2020,"" he told reporters. Behind him, steel panels atop a concrete levee wall, 30 feet in all, are rising from the sugar cane fields and bird sanctuaries of the valley — which is really a river delta. They are the first section of new border wall built under President Trump where there was no barrier before.
But that swaggering Washington confidence is not shared down on the border. Asked about Trump's Election Day deadline, Carmen Qualia, an assistant chief with the Border Patrol, acknowledged it's slow going.
""[Trump] said, 'Hey, here's my deadline, here's what I need you to do.' So we're gonna continue to work towards meeting that deadline,"" said Qualia, who is in charge of the Rio Grande Valley wall team. ""And we're either going to make it or not.""
Trump gets an additional $1.4 billion toward his massive wall along the 2,000-mile southwest border under a government spending bill he is expected to sign. But in Texas, there's widespread skepticism the president will have anywhere near the 450 miles of wall he wants by next December. Construction has already fallen behind schedule because of how difficult it is to take private land.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Cedar Attanasio/AP Cedar Attanasio/AP
One contract reviewed by NPR, called RGV10, says construction isn't expected to begin on certain wall segments until March 2021 — well after the election.
""If you don't have 12 months to acquire property, you're cutting it way too short,"" said Hyla Head, a former real estate specialist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers who spearheaded land acquisition for the first phase of wall-building under President George W. Bush in 2008.
Customs and Border Protection, which is part of Homeland Security, doesn't yet own most of the land where it plans to build the wall. In fact, Wolf's photo op was staged on a half-mile section of the levee that was only recently acquired by the federal government. Hidalgo County land records show that much of the property needed to complete that stretch of wall is still in private hands.
Disorderly property records, complications with landowners and a cumbersome condemnation process have slowed progress to a snail's pace. That's despite an army of federal land specialists trying to rush the process to please the president.
Consider this: The government plans to erect 110 miles of the total 450 miles of barriers in the Rio Grande Valley. But as of last week, the feds still needed to acquire about 90 miles from private landowners. In fact, since January 2017 the administration has only taken three miles from private owners in the Rio Grande Valley, according to a CBP spokesperson.
""It's a big project,"" Qualia said. ""We're gonna continue to do what we can to make it happen.""
But she says agents want the tall wall, along with floodlights, sensors, cameras and a 150-foot-wide enforcement zone to combat drug and human trafficking.
""We've been asking for these tools, this technology ... the roads,"" Qualia said. ""And if it takes longer, it takes longer.""
Most of the borderlands in Texas are privately owned, unlike states to the west where a strip along the border is mostly federal property.

""Every project that has real estate acquisition is prevented from making faster progress,"" said a senior manager with detailed knowledge of wall building in the Rio Grande Valley who is not authorized to speak publicly.
Under eminent domain, the government can take private property for public use, but it has to pay for it. And that process is laborious and legalistic.
""Federal entities that acquire property have a process,"" said Head. ""You may not like it, but this is tried and true. We have laws to protect property owners.""
Roy Brandys, an eminent domain lawyer in Austin, Texas, has long experience representing border clients. Asked about completing the border wall in the valley by next December, he said, ""That would be a very aggressive schedule, very difficult to get accomplished just because of all the different issues that properties have.""
Each step of the process is proving problematic. First, the government has to identify and make contact with each property owner.
In Starr County, at the western end of the Rio Grande Valley, the government is planning 52 miles of border wall. Ultimately, the administration will need to acquire acreage on hundreds of individual parcels. So far, the wall contractor has broken ground only in one unit owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
""It's very difficult to know who the rightful owners are. That's the biggest challenge,"" said Rosalva Guerra, the chief appraiser of Starr County, where property records are notoriously incomplete.
Enlarge this image toggle caption John Burnett/NPR John Burnett/NPR
In her tidy office, she pulls up a map on her computer screen that shows all the properties in the county. The map is awash with red, the color used to denote parcels where the county is unsure of the owner.
In Starr County, property has been handed down through many generations, some of it going back to land grants made by the King of Spain. Tracts are divided and subdivided between heirs, but Guerra says they rarely establish clear title.
""So can you imagine the long list of heirs to partition that?"" Guerra said. ""It's a nightmare. Yeah, it's just going to take a long time to be able to do that. I don't think it's going to happen by 2020.""
Yet a senior CBP official in Washington was not so pessimistic about the construction timetable. ""If [landowners] don't voluntarily sell and we have to condemn the property,"" the official said, ""the judge can grant possession to the government nearly immediately after the declaration of taking and we can begin construction. ... We're getting a lot of offers to sell down there.""
Enlarge this image toggle caption Verónica G. Cárdenas for NPR Verónica G. Cárdenas for NPR
Identifying the owner is only the first step. Then the government must request access to survey the land. So far, the Justice Department has had to sue nearly 50 property owners in the Rio Grande Valley just to get that access.
One of those defendants is Delfino Garza, an architect in Starr County. He didn't want government surveyors coming on his property outside Rio Grande City where he has a vineyard. As a sideline, he planted grapes a decade ago, clearing thick brush down by the Rio Grande for his vine rows.
""After about the third year, we started to make wine. And now in the last year they came to us about putting a border wall on our property,"" Garza said.
Garza is fighting the border wall. He voted for Trump, but he says he won't do so a second time. He fears the wall will kill his infant winemaking business.
""People don't go to wineries to see a border wall,"" he said. ""We want this to be an attraction for the city. And this is just hurting us.""
Qualia, the Border Patrol official in charge of the Rio Grande Valley wall team, says the government is trying not to be heavy-handed. Land acquistion specialists are spending time talking to landowners like Garza about the placement of the barrier on his vineyard property.
""I think it's important to note that we all live here, too,"" Qualia said. ""Our kids go to school. We go to church. So we really take that into consideration when we're sitting down and meeting with these owners.""
And, inevitably, those discussions with landowners will delay the project further. ""Things that are complicated typically do take time,"" Qualia added.
Meanwhile, Trump has appointed his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner to oversee and speed up completion of the border wall. The president has asked for frequent updates. He reportedly told aides earlier this year, just ""take the land.""
But in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, it's not that easy.

The Trump administration’s chief border enforcement official cast doubt on the administration’s goal of completing construction of the southern border wall by 2021, throwing cold water on one of the Trump campaign’s major promises heading into next year’s election.
“It’s hard right now to say whether we’re still going to meet that goal,” Customs and Border Protection acting commissioner Mark Morgan said in an interview with The New York Times published Wednesday. “But I’m confident we’re going to be close.”

President Trump has promised to install 450 miles of new border wall by 2021.
In September, Defense Secretary Mark Esper approved the transfer of $3.6 billion from military construction projects to build 175 miles of border wall, a move that comes several months after Trump declared a national emergency regarding the situation at the border, where thousands of migrants have crossed into the U.S. illegally this year.
Until this month, the administration had focused on rebuilding existing barriers and fences at the border, resulting in 93 miles of new wall, most of which was built on federal land where border barriers previously existed. On December 5, construction began in Donna, Texas for the first new eight-mile section of border wall.

In Texas, the administration is also reportedly hoping to exercise eminent domain laws against private landowners along the border to expedite wall construction on their land.

Border authorities have continued to tighten immigration laws over the past year after the flow of undocumented immigrants surged at the U.S.-Mexico border during the spring. In September, the Department of Homeland Security announced that the vast majority of migrant families who enter the country illegally will no longer be eligible for so-called “catch and release” due to the implementation of the “Migrant Protection Protocols,” which require that migrants wait in Mexico while their asylum claims are being adjudicated.

6814,New Jersey just became the 15th state to pass a bill letting unauthorized immigrants obtain driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses',Vox,12/20/2019,,,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/18/21028348/new-jersey-unauthorized-undocumented-illegal-immigrant-drivers-license-law-murphy-ice-dhs,"New Jersey has joined 14 other states in passing a law allowing unauthorized immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses — meaning that nearly half of the estimated 10.6 million unauthorized immigrants currently in the US now live in states with such laws.
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, is expected to sign the bill passed by the New Jersey Legislature on Monday night. The legislation would create two forms of driver’s licenses: a federally compliant Real ID license that let people board planes, and a “standard” driver’s license for driving and identification, for which unauthorized immigrants could use foreign passports or driver’s licenses to apply rather than a Social Security number. If signed, the bill would go into effect in January 2021.
The states of California, Connecticut, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Washington, Illinois, Vermont, Maryland, Delaware, Hawaii, Oregon, and New York, as well as Puerto Rico and Washington, DC, already offer driver’s licenses to unauthorized immigrants — meaning that roughly 5.3 million unauthorized immigrants nationwide would be eligible to get one, according to 2017 estimates.
Immigrant advocates continue to lobby other states to pass similar laws, including Florida, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Texas, and Massachusetts, which first proposed such legislation 15 years ago.
Research suggests that making driver’s licenses available to unauthorized immigrants improves safety. Obtaining a license requires testing and training on road safety, as well as proof that an applicant can get auto insurance. Drivers with licenses are also more willing to cooperate with law enforcement, reducing burdens on police forces.
A 2016 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal found that after California implemented its driver’s license law in 2015, hit-and-runs dropped between 7 percent and 10 percent on average — amounting to roughly 4,000 fewer such accidents annually.
Such policies also have financial benefits, both for local governments and for drivers. The Fiscal Policy Institute found in 2017 that state and county governments could collect about $57 million in annual revenue, as well as $26 million in one-time revenues, by issuing 150,000 driver’s licenses to unauthorized immigrants in New York City. The researchers also determined that it would likely lower auto insurance premiums overall.
An analysis conducted by New York City also found that having a driver’s licenses provides additional financial stability for families and increases employment opportunities for unauthorized immigrants. Having a car allows them to look for jobs and housing that are not located near public transportation.
It also helps to shield them from deportation. If a police officer pulls over an authorized immigrant driving without a license, they could be referred to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and sent to removal proceedings.
But even unauthorized immigrants with driver’s licenses might still be at risk for deportation. A lawsuit filed in January claimed that the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles had unlawfully targeted unauthorized immigrants by sending their names, photos, car registrations, and other personal information to ICE.
The Trump administration has pushed back against efforts to prevent ICE from accessing DMV data. As New York’s driver’s license law went into effect Monday, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that those records allow it to investigate crimes such as human trafficking by “building criminal cases, identifying criminal suspects, and enhancing officer safety.”"
5370,"New York law lets undocumented immigrants apply for driver's licenses, blocks ICE access""",USA TODAY,12/20/2019,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/19/new-york-drivers-licenses-open-undocumented-immigrants-green-light-law/2696451001/,"ALBANY, N.Y. – Federal immigration and border officials have been blocked from New York's DMV database, a move that keeps them from accessing data that can be used to help determine whether a vehicle owner has a criminal history or a warrant for their arrest.
New York's Green Light Law took effect Saturday, allowing those without legal immigration status to apply for driver's licenses in New York.
But the law also included a provision prohibiting state DMV officials from providing any of its data to entities that enforce immigration law unless a judge orders them to, leading the state to cut off database access to at least three federal agencies last week.
Among them were U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP — which patrols the U.S.-Canada border in New York — and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.
Federal officials appeared caught off guard by the change last week, which was laid out in the state law approved in June.
The information federal officers can access from the database is important to keep them and the public safe, said Mark Morgan, CBP's acting commissioner.
“New York’s Green Light Law is detrimental to CBP and ICE,"" Morgan said in a statement Tuesday.
""The information we receive from New York state is vital to our missions, and blocking federal law enforcement officers from accessing it creates a significant threat to both officer and public safety.”
The data is ""vital to building out these criminal cases, identifying criminal suspects, and enhancing officer safety,"" according to the Department of Homeland Security.
Border crisis:One deadly week reveals where the immigration crisis begins — and where it ends
Database serves as law-enforcement tool
The DMV database allows officers to quickly access information about a vehicle registration holder, including their traffic history. The data can then be used to determine whether a driver is on a sex-offender registry or has a criminal history and whether they have outstanding warrants.
Officers often run license plates through the database during traffic stops and similar encounters.
New York's Democratic-led Legislature and Gov. Andrew Cuomo approved the Green Light Law in June, allowing immigrants living in the country without legal permission to use foreign-issued documents to prove their age and identity so they can apply for driving privileges.
The law reversed the state's post-9/11 policy of denying driving privileges to immigrants without legal immigration status.
State lawmakers inserted the data-blocking provision into the bill a week before it passed, when immigrant organizations and Cuomo expressed concern that ICE and CBP would be able to easily obtain information about immigrants seeking a license, perhaps making it easier for them to be deported.
Specifically, the provision says DMV ""shall not disclose"" any records or information to ""any agency that primarily enforces immigration law.""
The only exceptions are if the DMV commissioner is served with ""a lawful court order or judicial warrant,"" according to the law.
Even then, the DMV has to notify the person at the center of a federal agency's inquiry within three days.
DMV spokeswoman Lisa Koumjian said the state agency is bound by the law. No negotiations are underway to restore the federal agencies' access to the database, she said.
""Under the Green Light Law, no DMV data of any kind can be shared with an agency that primarily enforces immigration law, which means ICE, Customs and Border Protection and Citizenship and Immigration Services do not have access to data unless the DMV is presented with a valid judge-signed court order, subpoena or judicial warrant,"" Koumjian said in a statement.
Report:US to send asylum seekers to Honduras, blocking them from making a claim in America
Trump's DOJ calls provision 'legally suspect'
Anu Joshi, the New York Immigration Coalition's senior director of immigration policy, said supporters of the Green Light Law are proud it has ""some of the strongest privacy protections of any such law in the country.""
At least a dozen other states allow undocumented immigrants to apply for driving privileges.
""We should be clear that this law doesn't just protect the data of undocumented immigrants; it protects the data of all New Yorkers who are applying for a standard license,"" Joshi said Tuesday. ""It treats all New Yorkers who are applying for a standard license the same.""
President Donald Trump's Department of Justice weighed in earlier this month, intervening in Rensselaer County Clerk Frank Merola's lawsuit that sought to block the Green Light Law from taking effect.
Trump, a Republican, has made tough immigration policies a central piece of his presidency.
The DOJ only weighed in on the data-blocking provision, calling it ""legally suspect"" and questioning whether it violates federal law.
But U.S. District Judge Gary Sharpe later dismissed Merola's lawsuit entirely without considering the DOJ questions, deciding Merola didn't have the legal capacity to sue.
U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., wrote a letter Friday to Cuomo, a Democrat, urging him to restore the federal agencies' access to the DMV information.
She questioned whether citizens with enhanced driver's licenses — which allow the license holder to cross the Canadian border — would be able to re-enter the U.S. if Customs agents don't have access to the database.
A CBP spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether that's the case.
""Hamstringing (Border Patrol agents') ability to effectively execute their jobs is a huge mistake and I urge you to consider the safety of all Americans by immediately reversing this decision,"" Stefanik wrote.

Phil Murphy signs law letting illegal immigrants get driver's licenses""",Fox News (Online),12/20/2019,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/illegal-immigrant-drivers-licenses-phil-murphy,"New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy signed a bill on Thursday allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses, making the Garden State the 14th state in the country, along with the District of Columbia, to enact such a measure.
""Expanding access to driver's licenses is critical for the safety of New Jerseyans and a step toward building a stronger and fairer New Jersey for all,"" Murphy said.
Murphy, a Democrat, signed the bill after it was approved by the Democratic majorities in both the state Assembly and Senate, during their final legislative sessions of the year.
“The legislation advanced on the Assembly floor and by the Senate today is fair and responsible,” Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, a Democrat, told The Wall Street Journal. “It brings us one step closer to ensuring all motor vehicles and drivers are insured, thereby creating safer roadways for all New Jersey residents.”
ACTING DHS SECRETARY: STATES PLAYING POLITICS WITH PUBLIC SAFETY BY GIVING DRIVERS LICENSES TO ILLEGALS
The legislation allows illegal immigrants over age 16 to obtain driver's licenses and learner's permits. Applicants can use foreign documents such as passports or their old driver's license from their home country to complete the process. A Social Security number is not required, according to The Associated Press.
The law reportedly establishes two types of licenses. One would conform to federal REAL ID requirements and would require proof of legal residency. The second license would only require six points of identification. The applicant would not have to provide proof of U.S. citizenship.

A similar measure known as ""The Green Light Law"" was signed by New York's Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo earlier this year and went into effect this week. It also allows illegal immigrants to obtain a license without having to provide a Social Security number or proof of American citizenship.

2364,Pentagon watchdog plans to review award of $400M border wall contract to firm touted by Trump',NBC News (Online),12/12/2019,,,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/pentagon-watchdog-plans-review-award-400m-border-wall-contract-firm-n1099911,"WASHINGTON — The Defense Department's internal watchdog plans to review a recent Army Corps of Engineers decision to award a $400 million contract for border wall construction to a North Dakota company that has been publicly and privately endorsed by members of the Trump administration, including the president himself.
The review of the award to Fisher Sand & Gravel is an audit by the Pentagon's inspector general and comes in response to a request by Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the Democratic chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security. Thompson said the decision to award the contract should be reviewed because Fisher's ""proposals reportedly did not meet the operational requirements of U.S. Customs and Border Protection"" and because of ""concerns about the possibility of inappropriate influence"" on the Army Corps of Engineers.
""This is in response to your December 4, 2019, letter requesting that the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General conduct a review of the $400 million contract the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers awarded to Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. to design and build border infrastructure in Yuma County, Arizona,"" wrote Glenn Fine, the principal deputy inspector general, according to a copy of the inspector general's response to Thompson obtained by NBC News. “In your letter, you raised concerns about the possibility of inappropriate influence on USACE's contracting decision, and questioned whether the bid submitted by Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. met solicitation standards. You also questioned whether USACE made the award in accordance with federal procurement law and regulations.""
""In response to your request, we have decided to initiate an audit of the solicitation and award of this contract,"" Fine wrote. ""We are assessing the methodology of that audit and will formally announce the audit soon.""
Thompson said Thursday he was pleased the inspector general ""recognized the urgency of our request. ... The company had never been awarded a construction contract before and their wall prototype was late and over budget.""
""Given the president's multiple endorsements of this company and the amount of taxpayer money at stake, I remain concerned about the possibility of inappropriate influence,"" Thompson said.

For years and in recent meetings, the president has pushed the Army Corps of Engineers to consider awarding a contract for border wall construction to Fisher, according to three sources familiar with the discussions. And in a trip to the border in November, Trump's new acting secretary of homeland security and the chief of the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector toured a privately funded wall built by Fisher.
The renewed push for Fisher by Trump and DHS officials caught many by surprise, given the controversy in which the company has been entangled. The Washington Post first reported Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., held up the confirmation of a White House official in his demands to see border wall contracts that had gone out to other companies.

Officials feared Cramer was attempting to share proprietary information with Fisher so that they could make their bid more competitive. Cramer was a proponent of Fisher, a company from his home state, and had repeatedly made outreach on their behalf to the White House.
According to two U.S. officials, on a visit to the border early this year, Trump said he wanted the border wall to be two things: Cheap and good-looking. And Fisher had promised just that with its proposal of a concrete barrier for one-third of the cost of other bidders.
Fisher was officially awarded the contract Dec. 2. The details of its winning design are not known.
In a statement on Thursday, a Fisher spokesperson said, ""Fisher is committed to full cooperation with any inquiry or audit. Fisher was one of 3 bidders on the Army Corps contract and Fisher was chosen for award based on the merits of its proposal as the Lowest Priced, Technically Acceptable offeror.""
Border agents have repeatedly said they want the ability to see through any barrier built along the border, and the concrete design Fisher originally proposed would not give them that ability. There was also doubt that Fisher has the ability to carry through the project, especially at the low cost it has estimated.
In the spring of 2018, when Trump first began telling his advisers he wanted Fisher to be awarded a contract, officials at DHS pushed back, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.
""We had to explain the rules of federal procurement. You can't just pick a winner,"" said a person familiar with the conversations about Fisher with Trump in 2018. ""He thought he could get three times the amount of wall because they were offering it for one-third of the price. But we were dubious.""
Eventually, Trump was assuaged by Army Corps of Engineers officials who told him they would be sure Fisher was at least considered in the bidding process. Prior to the new contract, none of the contracts awarded for new or replacement wall had been given to Fisher. Recently, however, Fisher's name is back on the president's tongue and many of his allies, including his newly named acting DHS secretary.
Last month, Chad Wolf toured a 3.5-mile wall under construction by Fisher on private land near El Paso, Texas. The construction of the ""water wall,"" which runs adjacent to the Rio Grande, was funded by crowd-sourcing through a group called ""We Build the Wall.""
Gloria Chavez, chief of the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector, said that after We Build the Wall began building its barrier, ""Everything changed for us, and we were able to manage the border enforcement actions there even better.""
We Build the Wall is led by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state whose views had been considered too extreme to head Trump's Department of Homeland Security. Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner has also been a proponent of Fisher's and We Build the Wall in internal meetings, according to a former DHS official, a congressional aide and a U.S. official."

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Defense Department’s internal watchdog is investigating a $400 million border wall contract awarded to a firm that used multiple appearances on Fox News to push for the job.
The Pentagon’s inspector general sent a letter Thursday to House Homeland Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson telling him the contract awarded to North Dakota-based firm Fisher Sand and Gravel Co. would be audited. Thompson, D-Miss., asked for the review last week, in part over concerns the proposals did not meet operational requirements and prototypes came in late and over budget.

Tommy Fisher, the head of the family business, said Thursday there would be “nothing to find” in an audit.
“We were told we were the lowest price and the best value,” he said. “We look forward to working with the Army Corps of Engineers.”
The border wall is one of Trump’s top priorities . He campaigned on a promise to build a “big beautiful wall” between the U.S. and Mexico,” said Mexico would pay for it, and promised to build 450 to 500 miles by the end of 2020. Mexico is not paying for the wall and, as of Nov. 1, Trump had built 78 miles.
Trump’s effort to push through funding, using money from the Pentagon after Congress refused to fund the wall has been met with resistance and lawsuits. A federal judge this week blocked the administration from spending some Defense Department money on the the barrier — the money includes the contract for Fisher.
The company was awarded a contract Dec. 2 to build 31 miles of wall in Arizona, part of a series of contracts to push out increased mileage. Fisher had made a number of appearances on Trump’s favorite cable news channel — Fox News — talking about his desire to win a contract. His firm, though, has little experience with such construction and a previous proposal was rejected.
Fisher said his company could do the work for $13 million a mile. He said the next closest bid was $20 million a mile.
A letter from the Army Corps when Fisher was awarded the contract said the company’s proposal was both technically acceptable, and the best priced.
Two administration officials familiar with the matter told The Associated Press this year that Trump aggressively pushed the Fisher firm’s bid with the heads of Homeland Security and the Army Corps of Engineers, which manages wall contracts. The interference in federal contracting by a president concerned some overseeing the process but, the officials said, Trump insisted Fisher could get the wall up faster and cheaper than other bidders. The officials weren’t authorized to speak about internal discussions and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.

Thompson had said one of his concerns was that officials from Homeland Security, the department managing border security, had toured a private barrier built by the company shortly before the contract was awarded.
The Pentagon watchdog said it was assessing how to complete the audit and would formally announce it soon.
Thompson said he was pleased.
“The company had never been awarded a construction contract before and their wall prototype was late and over budget,” he said in a statement. “Given the President’s multiple endorsements of this company and the amount of taxpayer money at stake, I remain concerned about the possibility of inappropriate influence on the Army Corps’ contracting decision.”
The award was the second-largest contract in the company’s history. Previously, Fisher built highways, sold heavy equipment and did excavation work. The company unsuccessfully sued the government in April when it was not awarded a similar contract.

Following a request from Democratic lawmakers, the Pentagon’s watchdog will audit a recent Army Corps of Engineers decision to award a $400 million border-wall contract to a North Dakota company that was repeatedly praised by President Trump.
According to NBC News, which reviewed a copy of the letter sent from the Department of Defense (DoD) inspector general to the House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.), the audit has been initiated and will be formally announced soon.

Thompson sent a letter to the DoD on December 4 requesting an audit over “concerns about the possibility of inappropriate influence.” On December 2, the DoD announced that North-Dakota-based firm Fisher Sand and Gravel won the $400 million contract to build a 31-mile wall in Arizona’s Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge over the next year.
In a statement to National Review following the decision, the company said it looked forward “to the opportunity to work with the Army Corps of Engineers on this important project.”
“We are excited to show our high quality work . . . while helping to secure our southern border,” Fisher Industries’ statement read.

Company chief executive Tommy Fisher is a GOP donor and has claimed during appearances on Fox News that the company can build the border wall faster than the Army Corps of Engineers.

Trump has reportedly pushed since May for the Defense Department to accept Fisher’s bid, and allegedly brought up the company in several conversations with Department of Homeland Security officials as well as Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, commanding general of the Army Corps of Engineers.
Thompson said Thursday he was pleased with the decision to audit the contract.
“Given the president’s multiple endorsements of this company and the amount of taxpayer money at stake, I remain concerned about the possibility of inappropriate influence,” he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s boast of building part of the border wall in Colorado is garnering attention in the state, including from the state’s governor, Democrat Jared Polis.
Trump was speaking Wednesday to an audience in Pennsylvania when he included Colorado in a list of states where the border wall is being constructed, along with New Mexico and Texas.
The president said: “We’re building a wall in Colorado, we’re building a beautiful wall, a big one that really works, that you can’t get over, you can’t get under.”
Of course, Colorado doesn’t share a border with Mexico, which Polis, and others on social media noted.

Polis tweeted: “Well this is awkward ...Colorado doesn’t border Mexico. Good thing Colorado now offers free full day kindergarten so our kids can learn basic geography.”
Early Thursday, Trump tweeted that he made the comment about Colorado and the wall “kiddingly” and said people in Colorado would benefit from the wall on the border."

4894,Trump administration to restrict visas for uninsured applicants',Fox News (Online),10/5/2019,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-to-require-immigrants-to-prove-they-can-afford-health-insurance,"President Trump issued a proclamation Friday requiring immigrants applying for U.S. visas to prove they can afford health care.
Applicants will be denied entry into the U.S. unless they have plans to be covered by health insurance within 30 days of entering or have enough financial resources to cover the cost, according to the White House.
The measure would take effect Nov. 3 and will apply to applicants for visas from abroad. It will not be applied retroactively to those already in the U.S. It does not affect lawful permanent residents, nor does it apply to asylum seekers, refugees or children. However, it would apply to the spouses and parents of U.S. citizens.
“Hospitals and other providers often administer care to the uninsured without any hope of receiving reimbursement from them,” the White House explained. “The costs associated with this care are passed on to the American people in the form of higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher fees for medical services ... The United States has a long history of welcoming immigrants who come lawfully in search of brighter futures. We must continue that tradition while also addressing the challenges facing our healthcare system, including protecting both it and the American taxpayer from the burdens of uncompensated care.""
TOP WARREN CAMPAIGN OFFICIAL FIRED FOR 'INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR'
Hospitals have spent more than $35 billion, or an average of $7 million per hospital, on “unreimbursed services” over the last 10 years, according to the White House.
“Beyond imposing higher costs on hospitals and other healthcare infrastructure, uninsured individuals often use emergency rooms to seek remedies for a variety of non-emergency conditions, causing overcrowding and delays for those who truly need emergency services,” the White House added.
Under the proposed rule, the required insurance can be purchased individually or provided by an employer, and it can be short-term coverage or catastrophic. Medicaid doesn't count. And an immigrant will not be able to obtain a visa if using ObamaCare subsidies when buying insurance.
BERNIE SANDERS RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL, DOCTORS SAY HE SUFFERED A HEART ATTACK
According to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan immigration think tank, 57 percent of U.S. immigrants had private health insurance in 2017, compared with 69 percent of U.S.-born, and 30 percent had public health insurance coverage, compared with 36 percent of native-born. The institute also said the uninsured rate for immigrants dropped from 32 percent to 20 percent between 2013 to 2017.
Earlier this year the Trump administration issued a “public charge rule,” which will go into effect Oct. 15, allowing federal officials to deny green cards to applicants deemed likely to rely on government aid. Officials described the rule as a means to protect taxpayers and promote self-sufficiency among those granted permanent residence. Factors to be considered under the “public charge rule” are age, health, financial assets and education.
The White House also directed officials to recover income-based welfare payments from sponsors and proposed a rule requiring verification of immigration status for anyone seeking access to public housing benefits.

The new restrictions came as immigration and health care are at the forefront of the 2020 presidential race. Democratic candidates have repeatedly decried Trump’s strict immigration policies and most have touted ""Medicare-for-All"" or at the very least a public option for health care. Most have even taken it a step further and supported providing health care for undocumented immigrants. Trump mocked Democrats on Twitter who supported the idea at a Democratic primary debate in June.
“All Democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare,” Trump tweeted. “How about taking care of American Citizens first!? That’s the end of that race!”

3788,Trump Will Deny Immigrant Visas to Those Who Can\xe2\x80\x99t Pay for Health Care',New York Times (Online News),10/5/2019,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/us/immigrant-visas-health-care.html,"The surprise order is the latest step in a long effort by Stephen Miller, the president’s top immigration adviser, and others in the administration, to limit what they consider the financial burdens of allowing immigrants into the United States.
After years of effort by Mr. Miller, the administration issued a regulation in August that would allow officials to deny permanent legal status to immigrants who are poor. The regulation, which imposes an aggressive wealth test on legal immigrants, has faced several legal challenges but will go into effect on Oct. 15 unless it is blocked by a court.
That policy, known as the “public charge” rule, says immigrants seeking to live permanently in the United States could be denied if officials deem it is likely they will be a burden on society by, for example, being unable to pay for health care or seeking food and housing assistance.
Under the new proclamation, which was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal, officials are directed to use a similar approach in determining whether to grant immigrant visas to people seeking to live in the United States.
Immigration advocates were taken aback by the proclamation, noting there are already several steps that applicants for a green card must take to qualify, including passing background checks and health examinations.
Elizabeth Jamae, an immigration lawyer at Pearl Law Group in San Francisco, said she doubted the assertion in the proclamation that lawful immigrants were about three times as likely as United States citizens to lack health insurance.
“Most people who are receiving green cards already have a job waiting or have a spouse that is employed,” Ms. Jamae said. “When you apply for a green card you already have to meet certain financial requirements.”"

The Trump administration said it won’t admit immigrants who can’t cover their own medical costs, a policy criticized as likely to lead to separations for some families and that could quickly face legal challenges.
Would-be immigrants will need to show they’ll be covered by health insurance within 30 days of entering the U.S. or have the financial resources to pay their medical bills, or be denied visas, President Donald Trump said in a proclamation issued late Friday.
The move aims to reject those “who will financially burden the United States health care system,” according to the proclamation.
The measure, set to take effect Nov. 3, highlights Trump’s tough stance on immigrants that was central to his 2016 campaign, and remains prominent heading into the 2020 election. It also comes as the president is under pressure from a fast-moving impeachment inquiry.
It follows a move in August aimed at weeding out immigrants deemed likely to access various forms of taxpayer-funded assistance, such as food stamps or subsidized housing.
Trump Takes Aim at Legal Immigration With Reviews on Public Aid
“Donald Trump is panicking, and using cruel attacks on immigrants to distract and sow fear,” Julian Castro, a Democratic candidate for president and a former Obama administration cabinet member, said on Twitter.
The move effectively creates a mandate for immigrants to have health care insurance, after the administration overturned the Obama-era rule for all Americans to have coverage, which was a setback for efforts to reduce the level of uninsured in the U.S.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, tweeted that the move was “hypocrisy, xenophobia, and barbarism.”
In the proclamation, Trump said costs of services provided by hospitals that don’t get reimbursed has topped $35 billion each year in the past decade, and immigrants are about three times more likely to lack health insurance then U.S. citizens.
“While our health care system grapples with the challenges caused by uncompensated care, the United States Government is making the problem worse by admitting thousands of aliens who have not demonstrated any ability to pay for their health care costs,” Trump said.
Catch-22 Created
Other lawmakers objected.
“President Trump is shamelessly targeting & punishing low-income immigrants & families,” the 38-member Congressional Hispanic Caucus said a tweet. “Trump’s order will separate U.S. citizens from their legal immigrant spouses & loved ones. Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda has no bounds & is hurting American families.”
The policy creates a Catch-22 for some families, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Lawful immigrants qualify for health care subsidies, but “subsidized coverage does not qualify as insurance under the proclamation,” Levitt said in a tweet.
“Health insurance is hard enough for immigrants to access in this country; it’s hard enough for citizens too,” the immigrant rights group United We Dream said on Twitter.

3396,Honduras to accept more asylum seekers under latest U.S. immigration deal',Reuters,9/26/2019,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration/honduras-to-accept-more-asylum-seekers-under-latest-us-immigration-deal-idUSKBN1WA2QI,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Honduras signed a deal with the U.S. government on Wednesday that could push migrants who cross the country on the way to the United States back to seek asylum, in the latest bilateral deal with Central American countries aimed at curbing migration.

Wednesday’s “safe third country”-type deal is similar to agreements signed by El Salvador on Sept. 20 and Guatemala on July 26. The countries have released few details about how the agreements would be implemented.
(For a link to the El Salvador deal, please click on: tmsnrt.rs/2ldjzJI. For a link to Guatemala deal, click on: tmsnrt.rs/2niarEz)
The Honduras deal “will allow migrants to seek protection as close to home as possible,” said a senior U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official who told reporters about the deal in a conference call on condition of anonymity.The official did not say why he did not want to be named.
The Trump administration is moving forward with a July 16 rule that would bar most migrants from gaining U.S. asylum if they did not seek safe haven in a country they transited through first.
The rule, which accomplishes virtually the same thing being sought by the agreements, has faced legal challenges, however. A federal court initially blocked it from taking effect but the U.S. Supreme Court on Sept. 11 allowed it to be implemented while the court challenges are ongoing.
The bulk of migrants - mostly families - arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border are from the three northern triangle countries and many turn themselves in to border officials to ask for asylum in the United States.
President Donald Trump has made reducing the ballooning number of asylum claims, which have led to long backlogs in U.S. immigration courts, a top priority of his administration and has implemented a series of measures to try to discourage migrants from applying.
But immigrant advocates say sending people seeking refuge back to the region where they fled, even if not to their home country, violates international commitments meant to prevent vulnerable migrants from being returned to danger. The three countries have tiny asylum offices that could have trouble adequately processing a large number of claims, they say.
Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernandez has faced scrutiny over a court filing document related to the upcoming drug trafficking trial in New York of his brother, Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernandez. The president has denied any wrongdoing.
In a speech on Wednesday before the UN General Assembly, Hernandez again defended his political reputation against what he called “smears” from “criminals” and others, without outright referring to the allegations against him."

On September 11, the court ruled 5–4 to allow the Trump administration’s new asylum restrictions to go into effect, pending ongoing litigation. With limited exceptions, the measure prohibits anyone from requesting asylum at the US–Mexico border who previously transited through another country, effectively banning all but Mexicans from seeking such protections. The asylum ban is the latest in an escalating effort to fence off the United States from the racialized global poor, while ICE purges the country from within. In the context of mounting economic and ecological crises, we are faced with an increasingly dire choice: surrendering to global apartheid, enforced by US imperial power, or a collective struggle, guided by solidarity.
Mexico Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) campaigned on a promise to respect migrants’ human rights, and in the first months of his term issued over 13,000 humanitarian visas to migrants transiting through the country to seek asylum at the US border. But the visa program was short-lived, and in June, after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican imports, AMLO’s administration committed to reducing US-bound migration, deploying the newly formed National Guard to its southern border and agreeing to host US asylum seekers under what’s known as the “Remain in Mexico” policy. Mexico’s top migration official resigned in protest. For Genoveva Roldán, economist and researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, it’s a lose-lose situation. “Mexico is a dependent country; it doesn’t have the means, the economic autonomy [to respond to Trump’s tariff threats] like China did, to enter into a trade war with the United States,” she says. “Mexico is acting with a boot to its throat.” The outcome of the negotiations, however, is disastrous. “With this, Mexico has already tacitly become a Safe Third Country,” says Roldán. Under international law, Safe Third Country agreements can oblige migrants to seek asylum in countries of transit that can provide them adequate protections. Mexico, plagued by organized crime, corruption, and impunity, cannot guarantee migrants’ safety, and the meager existing services and infrastructure for migrants are already overwhelmed. “They’ve put Mexico into a position where it’s not going to be able to respond,” she warns. Xenophobia is rising across Mexico, and a humanitarian crisis rages at both borders. Mexico has detained more than 108,000 migrants in 2019, over 32,000 of them children. Tens of thousands more wait their turn to present claims at the US border through an unofficial and arbitrary metering process. US hearings are now conducted remotely in “tent courts,” further violating migrants’ right to due process and diminishing their chances of securing protections. Since July, the Remain in Mexico program has forced more than 42,000 applicants back into Mexico to await their asylum proceedings, where they are vulnerable to kidnapping and extortion. At least fifteen children have died at the border this year. “It’s an abomination,” says a US immigration attorney who works with migrants in Mexico, speaking anonymously for fear of reprisals from Mexican and US authorities — we’ll call him Alex. “People are being killed after asking for asylum . . . It’s going to be studied in the history books as a stain. It already is a huge stain on the US.”
Central America All this comes as the United States is pressuring vulnerable Central American countries — themselves the principal source of the current exodus — to block migrants transiting toward the United States. Panama has resisted US overtures. Guatemala, however, appears poised to implement a Safe Third Country agreement signed by the outgoing president, despite misgivings from the president-elect. Under the deal, migrants who pass through Guatemalan territory will be required to seek asylum there; those who fail to do so will be ineligible for US protections and could be deported back to Guatemala. One of the most unequal economies in Latin America, Guatemala ranks in the top three countries of origin for US asylum seekers. El Salvador’s new president, who recently unveiled a new, US-financed border patrol, just made a deal with DHS to become a Safe Third Country in all but name. Honduras, wracked with violence and protest since a US-backed 2009 coup d’état installed a corrupt authoritarian regime, may soon yield as well. President Juan Orlando Hernández, currently implicated in a major US narco-trafficking investigation, is in negotiations with DHS to harbor Nicaraguan and Cuban asylum seekers — and prevent them from continuing north. As Alex points out, “these countries are in no condition to be able to house any significant number of refugees or asylees.” Devastated by decades of US-backed genocidal anticommunist wars and neoliberal economic restructuring, Central America has expelled millions of its citizens to the United States, and indeed depends on those migrants’ remittances for survival. The region boasts some of the highest homicide rates in the world, with social movement leaders particularly vulnerable to attacks. “Safe Third Countries need to be safe,” says Alex. “There will be legal challenges to this in the US, and hopefully there will continue to be some sort of opposition in Guatemala and Honduras, because these are obviously farcical.”
Life or Death The United States hopes to render Central America and Mexico into prisons, each border another brick in Trump’s wall. Authorities are slowing the process and erecting physical and legal barriers in the hopes of discouraging migrants through attrition, or forcibly sending them back. The result is further suffering and endangerment. Migrants seeking to evade the authorities risk being preyed upon by organized crime in Mexico, drowning in the Rio Grande, or being driven into deadly deserts in the US southwest. More than 7,000 Africans have been trapped for weeks in Tapachula, the site of Mexico’s principal migrant detention center on the southern border with Guatemala, as Mexican authorities refuse to provide them with safe passage north. Alex describes Tapachula as a “carceral city”: “There have been raids in public spaces, there’ve been raids in the hotels, so migrants aren’t as publicly visible anymore,” he says. “They’re trying to frustrate people and keep people in Tapachula, to make people fearful of being out in public. There’s a huge increase in checkpoints on the roads.” The poorest and most vulnerable migrants, especially those who cannot afford to hire a smuggler, bear the brunt of the crackdown. Alex explains: “It creates a situation where there’s an increase in corruption, because the officers are still very much amenable to bribes. It also increases the vulnerability of women and LGBT migrants of sexual assault. And the traffickers are still getting people by that are able to pay the fees. They just charge more money and pay off the officials to be able to get through.” For Bryan, a Honduran who separated from a caravan in January to request asylum in Mexico, the implementation of Trump’s asylum ban “will only create a darker, sadder panorama, with more deaths and many more problems for people who migrate. But in the end, they won’t stop the migration.” Bryan volunteers at a Mexico City shelter, where he provides migrants with legal information. He stresses the urgent need for humanitarian relief, especially for the growing numbers of those returning to the country through the Remain in Mexico program. “They come back here, and they don’t have any options. They seek out shelters, and the shelters are full of people heading north.” In a recent visit to the shelter, officials from the International Organization for Migration told Bryan that migrants are adults and responsible for their own decisions. “My response was, okay, but if you tell me I can die there or die here, what options do I have? That’s not much of a decision.”"
2927,Judge Blocks Ban on Asylum-Seekers Who Travel through Safe Third Country',National Review,9/9/2019,,,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/judge-blocks-ban-on-asylum-seekers-who-travel-through-safe-third-country/,"Donald Trump looks at objects used to smuggle narcotics at the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol facility. (Reuters: Joshua Roberts)
A federal judge in San Francisco restored a nationwide injunction on Monday preventing the Trump administration’s ban on asylum-seekers who travelled through a so-called safe third country before arriving in the U.S.
U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar issued the ruling after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in August narrowed his previous nationwide injunction, allowing the Trump administration to implement the asylum-rule change in Texas and New Mexico but not in California or Arizona.

In response to an overwhelming surge in asylum-seekers arriving at the southern border, the administration announced in July that migrants who travel through a safe third country before arriving in the U.S. must apply for, and be denied, refugee status in that country before they can apply for asylum in the U.S.
The rule change would effectively bar Central American migrants, who comprise the vast majority of recent asylum-seekers, from applying for asylum in the U.S. after crossing through Mexico. Tigar ruled to temporarily block it in July after concluding that it violated federal immigration law. He also blocked another policy change that would have barred asylum-seekers who cross the border between ports of entry rather than surrendering themselves to law-enforcement authorities.
Mexico deployed 6,000 troops to its southern border in June after President Trump threatened to impose substantial tariffs on Mexican imports if steps were not taken to stem the flow of Central American migrants traveling through the country en route to the U.S. The troop deployment, combined with seasonal changes in migration patterns, appears to be having an effect: U.S. Customs and Border Patrol announced Wednesday that the number of border apprehensions has declined by more than 56 percent since peaking in May at 144,255.

5903,"Judge blocks Trump's asylum ban along entire U.S.-Mexico border for second time""",CBS News,9/9/2019,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-blocks-trumps-asylum-ban-along-entire-us-mexico-border-again-today/,"A federal judge on Monday restored a nationwide scope on an order he issued earlier in the summer to block the Trump administration's most sweeping effort yet to unilaterally restrict the asylum system for migrants from Central America and other parts of the world who seek refuge at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Judge Jon Tigar of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California reinstated a nationwide injunction blocking a joint Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security rule that makes most migrants who transited through a third country — and did not seek refuge there — ineligible for asylum when they reach the U.S. at one of the country's land borders.
Last month, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals did not grant the government's request to issue an administrative stay on a previous ruling by Tigar that blocked this near-total asylum ban. But the court also said the injunction blocking the rule only applied within the court's jurisdiction, barring the administration from implementing the policy in California and Arizona, but allowing the rule to be enforced along the rest of the border, in New Mexico and Texas.

Through Monday's ruling, Tigar again prohibited the administration from implementing the rule anywhere along the southern border.

Immigration advocates praised Tigar's decision. Melissa Crow, a senior supervising attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center's Immigrant Justice Project, said the order removes a ""major hurdle"" for asylum-seeking migrants.
""This ruling levels the playing field for all the vulnerable individuals and families seeking refuge in the United States,"" Crow said in a statement. ""With this decision, regardless of where they cross the border, these people should be able to seek asylum.""
Late last month, the Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to stay Tigar's initial injunction and allow the administration to implement the asylum ban nationwide.
Administration officials have maintained that the rule would help curb what they call ""forum shopping"" by migrants. They have repeatedly accused migrants of preferring to seek asylum in the U.S., rather than in the countries along their journey that might be able to offer them safe haven.
The administration was quick to condemn Tigar's ruling on Monday, with Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan denouncing it as the latest example of ""judicial activism."" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the judge's decision will hinder what she referred to as the administration's efforts to ""reform"" the nation's ""broken asylum system.""
""Immigration and border security policy cannot be run by any single district court judge who decides to issue a nationwide injunction,"" Grisham added in a statement. ""This ruling is a gift to human smugglers and traffickers and undermines the rule of law."""

U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar had issued a nationwide injunction in July blocking the rule, which would make most asylum-seekers who pass through another country before reaching the U.S. ineligible for asylum, with exceptions for victims of trafficking and migrants who have been denied asylum in the countries they traveled through.

The rule would primarily effect Central American migrants crossing through Mexico.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Tigar's initial ruling but narrowed the injunction to only border states within its jurisdiction — California and Arizona — before sending the question back to Tigar.
Tigar said Monday that the injunction should apply nationwide because the asylum rule represents a case where ""such breadth is necessary to remedy a plaintiff's harm.""
The Trump administration last month asked the Supreme Court to lift Tigar's injunction.
""The injunction now in effect is deeply flawed and should be stayed pending appeal and pending any further proceedings in this Court,"" Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in a filing.
The White House blasted the judge's decision in a statement.
""Immigration and border security policy cannot be run by any single district court judge who decides to issue a nationwide injunction,"" the White House said. ""This ruling is a gift to human smugglers and traffickers and undermines the rule of law. We previously asked the Supreme Court to set aside the district court’s injunction in its entirety, our request remains pending with the Court, and we look forward to it acting on our request.""
Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan said Monday that he was ""frustrated"" by the ruling and described it as a result of ""unprecedented judicial activism.""
“It’s very very frustrating but we’re going to keep going. We’ll continue to work within the current legal framework address this,"" Morgan told reporters at the White House.

Ismail B. Ajjawi, a 17-year-old Palestinian student who lives in Tyre, Lebanon, landed at Boston Logan International airport on Friday night in anticipation of starting his freshman year at Harvard University.
But his Ivy League career, in which he intended to study in Chemical and Physical Biology, ended before it even began when his visa was revoked and he was deported back home.
Ajjawi said that after landing, immigration officers subjected him hours of questioning and searched his phone and computer, and confronted him about his friends' social media posts sharing their political views that spoke against the U.S., he said to school newspaper the Harvard Crimson.
Incoming Harvard University freshman Ismail B. Ajjawi, a 17-year-old Palestinian refugee living in Lebanon, had his visa revoked hours after landing in the U.S. Friday night
Ajjawi says he spent a total of eight hours in Boston, which has nearest airport to the Cambridge, Massachusetts university, before he was forced to leave.
After landing he and several other international students faced questioning from immigration officials. But Ajjawi was held back while his peers were allowed to go.
He alleges that an immigration officer continued to question him about his religion and religious practices in Lebanon. That officer then asked the student to unlock his phone and laptop and searched them for five hours, Ajjawi alleges.
The officer then asked him about his friends’ social media activity saying she found posts sharing political views that were against the US.
'When I asked every time to have my phone back so I could tell them about the situation, the officer refused and told me to sit back in [my] position and not move at all,' Ajjawi said.
'After the 5 hours ended, she called me into a room, and she started screaming at me. She said that she found people posting political points of view that oppose the US on my friend[s] list,' he added.
Ajjawi replied saying that the political posts were not his own.
'I responded that I have no business with such posts and that I didn't like, [s]hare or comment on them and told her that I shouldn't be held responsible for what others post,' he said.
'I have no single post on my timeline discussing politics,' he added.
Despite his defense, the immigration officer canceled Ajjawi's visa and told him he would be deported. Ajjawi was allowed a phone call to his parents before he returned to Lebanon.
Ajjawi is now in Lebanon and in contact with a lawyer and the university with the hopes of resolving his visa before classes start next Tuesday September 3.
U. S. Customs and Border Protection told the Crimson they found Ajjawi 'inadmissible' to the country.
'Applicants must demonstrate they are admissible into the U.S. by overcoming ALL grounds of inadmissibility including health-related grounds, criminality, security reasons, public charge, labor certification, illegal entrants and immigration violations, documentation requirements, and miscellaneous grounds,' the statement said.
'This individual was deemed inadmissible to the United States based on information discovered during the CBP inspection.'
Harvard says they're in contact with the family and working to bring him back to campus.
'The University is working closely with the student’s family and appropriate authorities to resolve this matter so that he can join his classmates in the coming days,' a university spokesman said.
Harvard's International Office employs immigration lawyers who work to resolve visa-related issues international students encounter. Ajjawi says he's been in contact with Harvard International Office Director of Immigration Services Maureen Martin.
He was coming to Harvard on a scholarship given by AMIDEAST, a nonprofit, which is now aiding him with legal assistance.
Harvard Admissions did not immediately return DailyMail.com's request for comment.
Ajjawi says he was held at the Boston Logon international airport for eight hours and allegedly questioned for five hours, before immigration officials rescinded his visa and deported him
His deportation has sparked outrage among his friends.
'Deporting him back is of course unfair act, he is a very clever student and it is not appropriate to act with him this way,' Ajjawi's friend Selah Chehade said to DailyMail.com.
Ajjawi's revoked visa comes after the bright student was highlighted on a local news site Alaraby Entertainment about his success story, from being a refugee in Lebanon to getting into the coveted Ivy League school on a full scholarship.
'This was always my goal; I did everything with this goal in mind, including managing my time wisely and studying as much as I can,' Ajjawi said in the news video.
'My plan is to become a doctor. I’m going to major in Chemical and Physical Biology at Harvard, as a pre-med student, and then I will go on to medical school,' he added.
'My success, that of a Palestinian refugee in Lebanon, shows that Palestinians can be high achievers and attain success, despite their circumstances.'
His father was also included in that news cast, who proudly gushed about his son's success saying: 'This was a very happy moment for us, that all of his hard work paid off. Despite the severe hardships that the Palestinian people face, we are achieving high success.'
'I'm so proud of him and God willing he will be a good representative and example for Palestinians abroad.'"

American immigration officials stopped Ajjawi, a Palestinian resident of Tyre, Lebanon, at Boston Logan International Airport on Friday night, the Crimson reports, where he was held in custody for eight hours and subjected to invasive questioning by a female immigration officer, who then abruptly told him his study visa was being canceled and that he was being deported.

6801,Trump official revises Statue of Liberty poem to defend migrant rule change',BBC News,8/14/2019,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49323324,"Image copyright Getty Images
A top US immigration official has revised a quote inscribed on the Statue of Liberty in defence of a new policy that denies food aid to legal migrants.
The head of Citizenship and Immigration Services tweaked the passage: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"".
The official added the words ""who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge"".
He later said the poem had referred to ""people coming from Europe"".
Ken Cuccinelli, the Trump administration's acting head of Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced on Monday a new ""public charge"" requirement that limits legal migrants from seeking certain public benefits such as public housing or food aid, or are considered likely to do so in the future.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The New Colossus was written by New York-born poet Emma Lazarus in 1883
The new regulation, known as a ""public charge rule"", was published in the Federal Register on Monday and will take effect on 15 October.
The rule change is intended to reinforce ""ideals of self-sufficiency"", officials said. Critics argue that it will prevent low-income US residents from seeking help.
What did the official say?
On Tuesday, Mr Cuccinelli was asked by NPR whether the 1883 poem titled The New Colossus at the Statue of Liberty still applied.
""Would you also agree that Emma Lazarus's words etched on the Statue of Liberty, 'Give me your tired, give me your poor,' are also a part of the American ethos?"" asked NPR's Rachel Martin.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ken Cuccinelli, the acting head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services
""They certainly are,"" Mr Cuccinelli responded. ""Give me your tired and your poor - who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.""
""That plaque was put on the Statue of Liberty at almost the same time as the first public charge [law] was passed - very interesting timing,"" he added.
The actual passage reads in part: ""Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!""
In the interview, he added that immigrants are welcome ""who can stand on their own two feet, be self-sufficient, pull themselves up by their bootstraps, again, as in the American tradition"".
After the host asked if the policy ""appears to change the definition of the American dream,"" he said: ""We invite people to come here and join us as a privilege.
""No one has a right to become an American who isn't born here as an American.""
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Top immigration official says public charge rule will not target ""any particular group""
Mr Cuccinelli was pressed later on CNN about his comments, and pushed back on claims he was trying to re-write the poem. He insisted he was answering a question and accused people on the left of ""twisting"" his comments.
Then asked by anchor Erin Burnett about what America stands for, he said: ""Of course that poem was referring back to people coming from Europe - where they had class-based societies where people were considering wretched if they weren't in the right class.""
The two then discussed their own immigrant ancestry, with Ms Burnett pointing out his rule would have ""excluded"" her family.
""I'm here because they were allowed in, and I'm an anchor on CNN,"" she said.
Beto O'Rouke, a Democratic presidential hopeful from Texas, shared a clip from the interview and said the comments show his Trump administration ""think the Statue of Liberty only applies to white people"".
Who will be affected by the new rule?
Immigrants who are already permanent residents in the US are unlikely to be affected by the rule change.
It also does not apply to refugees and asylum applicants.
But applicants for visa extensions, green cards or US citizenship will be subject to the change.
Those who do not meet income standards or who are deemed likely to rely on benefits such as Medicaid (government-run healthcare) or housing vouchers in future may be blocked from entering the country.
Those already in the US could also have their applications rejected.
An estimated 22 million legal residents in the US are without citizenship, and many of these are likely to be affected.
President Trump has made immigration a central theme of his administration. This latest move is part of his government's efforts to curb legal immigration.
What has reaction been?
The Democratic led House Homeland Security Committee condemned Mr Cuccinelli's revision in a tweet, calling the words ""vile and un-American"".
""It's clear the Trump Administration just wants to keep certain people out,"" the committee wrote, calling Mr Cuccinelli ""a xenophobic, anti-immigrant fringe figure who has no business being in government"".
Others pointed to his background as the attorney general of Virginia, in which he led a conservative campaign against immigration and homosexuality.
Asked about Mr Cuccinelli's remarks on Tuesday, President Trump did not directly respond to the Statue of Liberty quote, but said: ""I don't think it's fair to have the American taxpayer pay for people to come into the United States.""
""I'm tired of seeing our taxpayer paying for people to come into the country and immediately go onto welfare and various other things.
""So I think we're doing it right."""
2899,Does The Statue Of Liberty Poem Invalidate U.S. Borders Or Require Giving Welfare To Non-Citizens?',The Federalist,8/14/2019,,,https://thefederalist.com/2019/08/13/statue-liberty-poem-invalidate-u-s-borders-require-giving-welfare-non-citizens/,"Acting Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli announced a change in the “public charge” rule Monday that will deny green cards for immigrants on Medicaid, food stamps, housing vouchers, and other public welfare. It of course elicited liberally charged questions from reporters.
The “public charge” rule, enacted in 1882, requires green card applicants to prove they will not be a burden to the United States. The new changes, detailed in an 800-page document going into effect mid-October, will determine “the totality of the circumstances when making a public charge inadmissibility determination.”
“Through the public charge rule, President Trump’s administration is re-enforcing the ideal of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility, ensuring that immigrants are able to support themselves and become successful in America,” Cuccinelli said in the press conference.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) arrests of several hundred illegal aliens in Mississippi last week incited yet another cycle of media outrage. Several White House reporters asked Cuccinelli about it. One quoted the poetic sentiment engraved on the Statue of Liberty, “Give me your tired, your poor…” Is this sentiment, he asked, still operative in the United States, or should it be removed from our statue?
The reporter was referring to the poem “The New Colossus,” written by Emma Lazarus in 1883. At the end of the poem Lady Liberty cries out, “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
This image of a destitute newcomer may seem in conflict with Cuccinelli’s self-sufficient immigrant. Is there a discrepancy in America’s immigration ethos? Are Lady Liberty’s words a reachable reality or a utopia? The answer typically depends on which side of the aisle you stand.
The first ideal says it is the government’s humanitarian duty to welcome all poor seeking refuge in the United States. All who come to our borders deserve to be wrapped with taxpayer-funded welfare blankets, no matter how bankrupt our systems are. These ideals are espoused by the left.
The second ideal is rooted in right-wing ideals of small government. It is not the government’s job to provide housing vouchers and Medicaid for everyone. The government’s first priority is to American citizens, and immigration policies and border controls are for our protection. We welcome immigrants here seeking the freedom that requires them to govern and provide for themselves.
One reporter asked in the press conference, “Why shouldn’t the Latino community feel targeted by this?”
“This is 140-year-old legal structure,” Cuccinelli said. “We’re dealing with the most recent iteration of it, but this is not new… There’s no reason for any particular group to feel like this is targeting them.”
America cannot save the world from all suffering. Americans cannot afford to support welfare for any person in the world who gets here and then demands it. That does not change the spirit of our immigration laws that welcomes those made poor and needy by totalitarian governments that take wealth from some and redistribute it to others in currently politically favored groups.

The Department of Homeland Security released a new regulation on Monday that would severely limit the number of impoverished migrants eligible to enter and remain in the U.S. legally by requiring that visa applicants not be reliant on public services.
Under the expanded public-charge rule, which was added to the Federal Register on Monday, the authorities will consider an immigrant’s use of non-cash government-assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid, as a negative factor in determining their eligibility for a green card or temporary visa.

Since 1996, the public-charge rule has only applied to cash-assistance programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and the Supplemental Security Income program.
The rule change will affect those migrants seeking to enter the U.S. and those who entered the country illegally but wish to obtain legal status. DHS officials will take into account would-be immigrants’ education, skills, employment history, health, and a number of other factors to determine whether they are likely to become dependent on the government.
Immigrant-rights advocates argue that the rule change will force needy families to choose between much-needed public services and their desire to secure lawful permanent residency.

The looming threat of the rule change, which was first proposed in October 2018, led one in seven adults in immigrant families to forego public services, according to a study by the Urban Institute.

White House adviser Steven Miller led the rule-change effort and was aided by the elevation of Ken Cuccinelli to director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services earlier this year, according to the New York Times.

6983,"White House: New immigration policy meant to promote 'self-sufficiency and personal responsibility'""",The Hill,8/12/2019,,,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/457093-white-house-defends-new-immigration-policy,"Acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli on Monday defended a controversial Trump administration rule that would link an immigrant's ability to secure green cards to their use of certain public programs.
Cuccinelli told reporters at the White House that the ""public charge"" change promotes “the ideals of self-sufficiency and personal responsibility.”

""We certainly expect people of any income to be able to stand on their own two feet. If people are not able to be self-sufficient, then this negative factor is going to bear very heavily against them in a decision about whether they’ll be able to become a legal permanent resident,"" he said.
“A poor person can be prepared to be self-sufficient. Many have been through the history of this country. Let’s not look at that as the be all and end all, it’s not the deciding factor. Which is why we continue to use the totality of circumstances test.”
Under the rule set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, receiving benefits like food stamps, Medicaid or housing subsidies will count negatively against a noncitizen's chance of getting a green card or visa. The ""public charge"" designation previously only singled out noncitizens receiving cash subsidies. Immigration advocacy groups have expressed concerns that expanding the designation could discourage immigrants from seeking necessary assistance.
Cuccinelli's mention of a ""totality of circumstances test"" refers to the holistic evaluation immigration officials will make over public charge designation, which also includes age and health.
One reporter asked whether the rule change signals a shift from the promise on the Statue of Liberty to welcome ""your tired, your poor.""
""I’m certainly not prepared to take anything down off the Statue of Liberty. We have a long history of being one of the most welcoming nations in the world on a lot of bases,"" Cuccinelli responded. ""Whether you be an asylee, whether you be coming here to joining your family, or immigrating yourself.""
Cuccinelli was also pressed on criticism that the rule change targets Hispanic communities in particular.
""First of all, this is 140-year-old legal structure,"" he said. ""We’re dealing with the most recent iteration of it, but this is not new. This was the same question might have been asked when my Italian immigrant ancestors were coming in, and all through that 140 years.""
When asked again about the majority of those likely to be affected being Hispanic, Cuccinelli said that ""if we had been having this conversation 100 years ago it would’ve applied to more Italians.”

6817,The Trump Administration Just Made It Harder To Apply For Green Cards And Visas',HuffPost,8/12/2019,,,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/public-charge-department-of-homeland-security-final-rule_n_5d449198e4b0ca604e31fb51,"The Department of Homeland Security officially published a change to what’s known as the “public charge” rule on Monday that would make it much harder to apply for a green card or earn a visa. The new policy, which is set to go into effect in mid-October, expands the definition of what would make an applicant likely to become a “public charge,” someone who the government has deemed would be dependent on it, thus rendering them ineligible for legal permanent residency status.
In October 2018, the DHS released its proposal for expanding the criteria for what constitutes a “public charge” to include those receiving non-cash government services, like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), when evaluating applications for visas and legal permanent residency. Currently, people are generally only considered public charges if they use cash assistance or long-term institutional care the government is funding.
The rule change also creates other factors to be weighed in consideration of the “totality of circumstances” aspect of the rule when evaluating green cards and visa applications including English proficiency, income level and health conditions. (Refugees and asylum-seekers, among others, are exempted from the rule.)
After the release of the DHS proposal, the rule went through a 60-day public comment period, during which the department received over 260,000 comments about the proposal. It reached the desk of the Office of Management and Budget on July 12.
Currently, the limited public charge definition means the regulation is not often used to justify the rejection of an application.
The administration is purporting to solve the “the alleged but illusory problem that immigrants are eating up taxpayer funds,” said Doug Rand, an Obama administration veteran who co-founded Boundless Immigration, a technology company that helps immigrants get green cards and citizenship. Rand added the change “makes no sense,” as undocumented immigrants are not allowed to access federal public benefits. He also said that the proposal was the administration’s effort at making “profound” changes to the immigration system without congressional approval.
Andrew Harnik/AP Photo The Department of Homeland security has published a change to the public charge rule, which will have ""chilling effects"" on millions of immigrants.
A study released in July found that 8.3 million children, most of whom are citizens, enrolled in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program or SNAP are at potential risk of being disenrolled, with more than 5 million of those children having specific medical needs. The researchers predict that between nearly 1 and 2 million children with specific medical needs will ultimately be disenrolled as a result of the rule change.
The rule’s public benefits component will not be applied retroactively, meaning those seeking green cards and visas who were enrolled in these public benefits programs before the rule was enacted will not be penalized for it.
The English proficiency criteria “privileges people from certain countries where English is already spoken,” according to Jackie Vimo, a policy analyst at the National Immigration Law Center.
The change to the public charge is one of multiple instances of the Trump administration attempting to change immigration policy without having to go through Congress. There’s also the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s proposal released on May 10 to halt eligibility for families with members holding different immigration statuses, or “mixed-status” families, in public and Section 8 housing, as well as other changes to the public charge rule and its enforcement.
Together, these changes “turn our immigration system into green cards for the highest bidder,” Vimo said.
While only those seeking green cards and visas are impacted by the rule, experts warn of a “chilling effect” that will prompt eligible immigrants to unenroll in government services. The chilling effect has already begun due to the fear generated by the proposal, ever since the idea was first reported on in February 2018.
A study from May found that one in seven adults in immigrant families have avoided public benefits programs, including some who would not be affected by the rule.
Rand believes that the “chilling effect is part of the intent.”
“A very large number of people are likely to disenroll from public benefits from which they are perfectly entitled under U.S. law,” he said.
In a letter sent July 24 obtained by HuffPost, 18 state attorneys general, spearheaded by Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson (D), claimed the Department of Homeland Security “entirely failed” in their estimation of the cost of their proposed public charge rule change. The lawmakers requested a meeting with the agency to further discuss the officials’ “significant concerns about the severe impact” of the proposed rule on their residents. They argue the rules would cause “extensive injury” to the economies of their states and to their states’ residents — it would cause loss of health insurance, medical access, and food and cash benefits.
“If implemented as proposed, the rules will result in a reduction of total economic output, a drop in workers’ wages, and elimination of jobs in our states,” the attorneys general wrote. The OMB did not accept their request for a meeting.
Ferguson told HuffPost that they are “exploring our legal options” and “actively preparing for a potential lawsuit” and that he is “confident you’ll see litigation from the states on the matter.”
The city of Baltimore and nonprofit public policy organization Democracy Forward sued President Donald Trump and the Department of State in November 2018 for their attempt to alter the public charge rules. They argued the Trump administration moved forward with its plans despite understanding that the rule change would deter lawfully present immigrants and naturalized citizens from obtaining the services they need and are eligible for."
3347,ICE Arrests 680 Illegal Aliens in Largest Single-State Raid in U.S. History',Breitbart News,8/8/2019,,,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/08/07/ice-arrests-680-illegal-aliens-in-largest-single-state-raid-in-u-s-history/,"The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency arrested 680 illegal aliens who had been working at seven Mississippi food processing plants, federal officials confirmed on Wednesday.
ICE agents conducted the largest single-state raid in United States history and the largest workplace raid in the last 11 years when they arrested 680 illegal aliens at seven food processing plants across six cities in Mississippi, including plants in Bay Springs, Carthage, Canton, Morton, Pelahatchie, and Sebastapol.
Not since 2008 — when about 595 illegal workers were arrested — has this many illegal aliens been arrested in a workplace raid by ICE.
According to federal officials, some of the hundreds of illegal aliens arrested on Wednesday have already been ordered deported by an immigration judge and have refused to self-deport. Those illegal aliens will be quickly deported.
Other illegal aliens have yet to go through the immigration courts and will be afforded a review process where they will make a case to remain in the U.S.
U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi Mike Hurst told the media at a press conference:
We are first and foremost a nation of laws and the Rule of Law is the bedrock, the very foundation, of our great country. I heard someone say that a country without borders is not a country at all and while I agree with that, I would also add that without law there is no order. Without the enforcement of law, there is no justice.
The food processing plants raided by ICE include the Koch Foods Inc. facility in Morton, Mississippi. The plant is not associated with the GOP mega-donor billionaires Charles and David Koch.
ICE officials said the investigation into the illegal aliens and their employers is ongoing and could not comment on specifics of the case.
“These are not victimless crimes,” an ICE official said. “Illegal workers create vulnerabilities in the marketplace … as well as stealing the identities of legal U.S. workers, citizens, and legal immigrants alike, who must suffer the long-lasting consequences of their stolen identities.”

Federal immigration officials raided several food-processing plants in Mississippi on Wednesday and arrested approximately 680 people believed to be working in the U.S. without authorization.
The coordinated raids were conducted by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations ""at seven agricultural processing plants across Mississippi,"" according to an ICE statement. In addition to the arrests, agents seized company business records.
More than 600 ICE agents were involved in the raids, surrounding the perimeters of the targeted plants to prevent workers, mainly Latino immigrants, from escaping. The actions were centered on plants near Jackson owned by five companies, according to The Associated Press.
One of the plants is owned by Koch Foods Inc., which bills itself as one of the largest poultry processors in the U.S. with more than 13,000 employees. Forbes ranks it as the 135th largest privately held company in the country, with an estimated $3.2 billion in annual revenue, according to Fortune.
Another plant raided Wednesday is in Canton, Miss., and is owned by Peco Foods Inc., based in Tuscaloosa, Ala. It is the eighth-largest poultry producer in the U.S., according to the company's website.
No representatives for either company responded to an email request or telephone call for comment.
The arrested workers were bused to a local Mississippi National Guard hangar, where they were interviewed about their immigration status, including whether they already had deportation orders.
""Today's raids are part of the ongoing war against immigrant families and the communities in which they live,"" Julia Solórzano, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in an emailed statement. ""It is especially sickening that days after immigrants were targeted by a gunman in El Paso, Texas, workers at plants across Mississippi witnessed armed agents descending on their workplace.
""It's also worth noting that immigration agencies that have repeatedly blamed 'over capacity' detention facilities for the horrific treatment of those imprisoned nevertheless detained more than 600 people today,"" she said.
The size of the raid operation harks back to 2008 when, under the George W. Bush administration, more than 400 unauthorized workers were arrested in a meatpacking facility in Iowa."
5918,"Families ""Are Scared To Death"" After A Massive ICE Operation Swept Up Hundreds Of People'",BuzzFeed News,8/8/2019,,,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/ice-raid-operation-mississippi-workplace-families,"On Wednesday morning, Dianne received an alarming call. It was her fiancé, dialing her from the chicken processing plant in a nearby central Mississippi town where he worked long shifts deboning meat.
“ICE is here!” he yelled. In the background, Dianne could hear other laborers terrified. The panic was palpable. One worker called out in Spanish, “Ayúdame! [Help me!]”
Dianne’s fiancé, who came to the country more than two decades ago from Mexico without authorization, told her he had no way out and would not be able to escape immigration enforcement agents. His voice trembling, he told Dianne that she needed to make a promise before he got off the line: “Take care of my kids.”
What the workers at the plant didn’t realize in that moment was they were about to be arrested in one of the largest worksite operations ever conducted by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. In total, some 680 suspected undocumented workers were arrested Wednesday after ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations agents swept through seven agricultural plants in the state as part of a criminal investigation. Deportation officers and HSI agents arrested the workers as they served criminal search warrants at the food plants.
Dianne’s fiancé is the father to three children, ages 13, 15, and 19, with his ex-wife, who was also undocumented and worked at a separate food plant in the area.
Not long after Dianne’s phone call with her fiancé, she found out that the kids’ mother was also arrested. Dianne, who requested her last name not be used for fear of consequences for her fiancé, sped to the local school, where she witnessed other adults coming to pick up children whose parents had been arrested. Some parents, she said, weren’t able to retrieve kids because they hadn’t been listed as authorized guardians.
On her way out of the school, she saw one girl looking confused, not knowing where to go because her parents had been arrested too.
“They were crying. They were shocked. They’re just worried,” Dianne said of her fiancé’s children. “I’m just trying to stay strong for them. I’m trying to remain as calm as possible. It’s one thing to know this could happen but it is another to see it happening. This is heart-wrenching. They are scared.”
Details of the targets of the immigration operation, which was conducted in partnership with the local US attorney’s office, were not immediately available as officials said the investigation was ongoing.
“We are a nation of laws, and we will remain so by continuing to enforce our laws and ensuring that justice is done,” said US Attorney Mike Hurst.
ICE officials said that each worker arrested would be evaluated for potential release on humanitarian grounds."

TRUMP VOWS RETALIATORY TARIFF ON FRANCE, SLAMS 'FOOLISH' TAX ON AMERICAN TECH GIANTS
Trump told reporters he believes “this will really help” with the situation at the border.
“This is a very big day,” he said.
The agreement would require migrants, including Salvadorans and Hondurans, who cross into Guatemala on their way to the U.S. to apply for protections in Guatemala instead of at the U.S. border. It could potentially ease the crush of migrants overwhelming the U.S. immigration system and hand Trump a concession he could herald as a win as he struggles to live up to his campaign promises on immigration.
The announcement comes after a court in California blocked Trump's most restrictive asylum effort to date, one that would effectively end protections at the southern border.
The two countries had been negotiating such an agreement for months, and Trump threatened Wednesday to place tariffs or other consequences on Guatemala if it didn't reach a deal.
It's not clear how the agreement will take effect. Guatemala's Constitutional Court has granted three injunctions preventing its government from entering into a deal without approval of the country's congress.

4002,"Here's how many Mexicans want migrants to be deported back to Central America""",TheBlaze.com,7/20/2019,,,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mexicans-polled-are-against-immigration,"A new poll of citizens in Mexico says that a majority are against the entrance of migrants from Central America to their country on their way to seek asylum in the United States.
The poll from the Washington Post and Reforma, a leading Mexican newspaper, found that nearly two thirds of Mexicans polled, 64 percent, said that migrants were a ""burden"" that took jobs and benefits away from their citizens.
The issue has become more contentious for Mexican nationals after President Donald Trump began a new policy of metering asylum seekers at the border, and making many wait in Mexico for the results of their request.
A video from Newsy featured a female Mexican citizen who angrily chanted, ""you are not welcome here!"" in a protest against migrants.
The poll also said that a majority, 55 percent, of Mexican citizens polled wanted the migrants to be deported back to their home countries.
Only a third polled, 33 percent, said that Mexico should give migrants temporary asylum or residency. A very small percentage, 7 percent, said they wanted the country to give them permanent residency.
The Mexican government has responded to pressure from Trump by offering more migrants benefits if they agree to stay in Mexico and abandon their attempt to seek asylum from the United States.
However, the Mexican to the United States, Martha Bárcena, said there's a limit to how long the country can host those seeking asylum.
""So we're working with our Central American neighbors to see what we can do so that people do not come to the border,"" Bárcena said.
""We maybe hold people for half a year,"" she added, ""one year, but not two years if the asylum process just goes on and on.""
Here's a video about the poll from Newsy:"

Instead, the data suggests Mexicans have turned against the migrants transiting through their own country, expressing antipathy that would be familiar to many supporters of President Trump north of the border.
The face-to-face survey among 1,200 Mexican adults was conducted after a sharp increase in immigration enforcement by Mexico following a June agreement with the Trump administration. Trump promised that deal would reduce the number of migrants crossing into the United States. He threatened to impose major tariffs on Mexico unless it complied.

For a year, Mexicans watched as a growing number of Central Americans moved through the country on their way to the U.S. border. Some of those migrants traveled by foot and bus in large caravans, sleeping in small-town plazas and relying on donations of food and clothes. Once they reached Mexico’s northern border, the migrants waited months for the United States to process their asylum claims, often overwhelming local shelters.
While migration from Central America through Mexico has existed for years, the overall increase in migrants as well as their more visible modes of transit turned the phenomenon into a public lightning rod. The Trump administration’s immigration policy, which forces many asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their hearings, increased the pool of migrants in northern Mexico and exacerbated the frustration felt by many Mexicans.
The Post-Reforma survey finds 7 percent of Mexicans say their country should offer residency to Central American immigrants traveling through Mexico and trying to enter the United States. Another 33 percent support allowing them to stay temporarily while the United States decides whether to admit them. But a 55 percent majority says they should be deported to their home countries.
AD

When Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador agreed to step up Mexico’s immigration enforcement to avert U.S. tariffs, many analysts expected his base to be disillusioned. López Obrador had long advocated for migrants’ rights and the freedom of movement for asylum seekers.
But 51 percent of Mexicans support using the country’s newly formed national guard to combat migration of undocumented immigrants in Mexico, a key provision of the agreement. Just under half of Mexicans have heard about the June agreement, but among those who have, 59 percent favor it ,while 34 percent are opposed.
Some dissatisfaction with the migration pact may come from López Obrador supporters who believe the agreement is unsympathetic toward Central Americans in search of refuge. But in parts of Mexico, the most vocal critique of the deal is that it has forced Mexican cities to contend with a growing pool of asylum seekers. In some northern cities, rumors have spread that African migrants are carrying Ebola. In others, officials say they’ve simply run out of places for migrants to stay.
AD
AD
Last week, for example, the governors of three northern Mexican states, Coahuila, Nuevo León and Tamaulipas, signed a statement saying that they could not accept any more migrants. They blamed López Obrador’s administration for allowing so many asylum seekers to wait along Mexico’s northern border without offering more resources to the region.
By August, Mexico expects to receive 60,000 asylum seekers who are forced by the United States to wait for their hearings on Mexican soil. López Obrador has said those migrants will be given work permits, but it remains unclear who will provide their shelter or food. Many are likely to spend months in Mexico before they are granted or denied asylum in the United States.
“The number [of migrants] that the federal government is talking about is impossible for us to deal with,” said Miguel Ángel Riquelme Solís, governor of Coahuila, at a news conference.

A total of 11.6 million documented and undocumented Mexican migrants live in the United States, but unauthorized migration from Mexico has declined sharply over the past decade. The Post-Reforma poll shows 78 percent of Mexicans say it’s harder to migrate to the United States than five years ago. This year, Guatemalans are on track to make up the largest group of migrants apprehended at the U.S. border. It would be the first time in recent history when Mexicans do not make up the largest group of migrants by nationality.
López Obrador holds a 70 percent job approval rating eight months after entering office, a strong standing albeit down from 78 percent in a Reforma poll in March. While he took office as a lifelong populist, López Obrador quickly had to respond to threats from Trump, mostly about immigration enforcement. Many expected López Obrador — who once compared Trump’s hostility toward Mexicans to the way Adolf Hitler spoke of Jews — to condemn the U.S. president. Instead, he has largely submitted to Trump’s demands on migration.
That posture prompted many Mexican public intellectuals to deride López Obrador as a puppet of the U.S. president. Commentators suggested that Mexico may not have paid for Trump’s border wall, but it had effectively “become the wall.”
AD
AD
Yet the Post-Reforma poll suggests that such an approach hasn’t eroded López Obrador’s popularity very much. A 54 percent majority say he is standing up for Mexico’s interests in his dealings with Trump, though a similar 55 percent say the recent immigration agreement was imposed upon Mexico by the United States rather than being negotiated by the two nations.
López Obrador gets relatively high marks for his treatment of migrants, with 44 percent saying he has done a good job on the issue and 27 percent rating him negatively.
Mexicans continue to have an overwhelmingly negative opinion about Trump. More than three-quarters of Mexicans dislike Trump, according to the survey, and more than 8 in 10 say he treats their country with disrespect.
The Post-Reforma poll finds a scant 2 percent of Mexicans name immigration as their country’s most important problem, with a 55 percent majority citing insecurity and 9 percent each mentioning corruption and unemployment. Another 7 percent name the economy, followed by 4 percent each who say poverty, political problems and social problems are the country’s more pressing concerns.
AD
AD
A sizable minority of Mexicans see migrants as a safety risk, with 39 percent believing they commit more crimes than Mexicans; 21 percent believe they commit fewer crimes, and 31 percent don’t see any difference.
Mexicans’ views of immigrants appear to have soured sharply in the past year. A 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center found 57 percent said immigrants mainly strengthen Mexico, while 37 percent said they weaken it. The Post-Reforma poll asked a similar question and found opinion reversed: 64 percent of Mexicans say migrants are mainly a burden on the country, and 20 percent see them as strengthening it.
Despite concerns about security and immigration, Mexicans are positive on balance about their country’s trajectory. Some 40 percent say Mexico is on the right track, while 26 percent think it’s on the wrong track, and 32 percent fall in the middle.
A 53 percent majority reports trust in the national guard, which was launched by López Obrador and has played a major role in increased immigration enforcement. Two-thirds of Mexicans say they would like the national guard to be in their city, and 45 percent say they feel more safe with the force in place.
López Obrador receives positive marks on fighting poverty, corruption, dealing with education and health issues. His ratings for some other issues are underwater — 45 percent give him negative marks on fighting drug trafficking and organized crime (24 percent rate him positively), and 41 percent rate him negatively on security (while 32 percent give him positive marks).

The survey was jointly sponsored by The Washington Post and Reforma. It was conducted July 9-14 among 1,200 Mexican adults through face-to-face interviews in 100 election districts across the country. The overall results have an error margin of plus or minus five percentage points."

More than 60 percent of Mexicans believe migrants are a burden and that they take away jobs and benefits, according to a recent poll. A majority supports deporting them.
NOEL KING, HOST:
Last month, Mexico made a deal with the United States to crack down on Central American migrants who are trying to make their way to the U.S. border. In June, Mexico arrested and deported the highest number of migrants in more than 10 years, and there were questions about how this tough approach would play in Mexico. But new public polling shows that Mexicans are in favor of this strategy. James Fredrick has the story from Mexico City.
JAMES FREDRICK, BYLINE: A poll conducted by The Washington Post and Mexican newspaper Reforma shows 55% of respondents think migrants should be deported back to their home country. For years, the largest share of migrants going to the U.S. came from Mexico. But now with thousands of Central Americans fleeing violence, repression and poverty, Mexico has become primarily a transit country for migrants. Late last year, when a large migrant caravan marched through Mexico, polls showed a majority of Mexicans thought their country should help the caravan. But support for migrants has eroded since. Claudia Leon Ang studies migration in Mexico and is the operations director of the Jesuit Refugee Service. She says anti-immigrant sentiment often comes from local media.
CLAUDIA LEON ANG: (Speaking Spanish).
FREDRICK: She says the content and style of local news often frames migrants as criminals. It's a compelling narrative in a country experiencing its highest levels of violent crime ever. But she says there's no evidence that immigrants are a driving force behind crime. Another issue is the growing number of asylum-seekers stuck in Mexico. Under a U.S. policy known as Remain in Mexico, nearly 20,000 asylum-seekers have been sent back to Mexico to wait months or even years for their asylum case to be heard in the U.S. But 6 in 10 people polled said migrants are a burden on the country. Here's Claudia Leon again.
ANG: (Speaking Spanish).
FREDRICK: She says, in a country with so much inequality, poverty and abandonment by public institutions, you're going to generate resentment. It seems this is now a fight of the poor versus the poor, she says. Another important detail in the poll, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whose administration is leading the crackdown on migrants, has a 70% approval rating. The Mexican government may have public support, but it faces steeper challenges as tens of thousands of people hoping to request asylum in the U.S. may now be stuck in Mexico surrounded by a public that doesn't want them.

3953,"Trump administration sets 'new bar' for immigrants seeking asylum""",Reuters,7/15/2019,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-thirdparty/trump-administration-sets-new-bar-for-immigrants-seeking-asylum-idUSKCN1UA1IL,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Monday unveiled a new rule to bar almost all immigrants from applying for asylum at the southern border, requiring them to first pursue safe haven in a third country through which they had traveled on the way to the United States.
The Department of Homeland Security, in a statement issued with the Department of Justice, said the rule would set a “new bar” for immigrants “by placing further restrictions or limitations on eligibility for aliens who seek asylum in the United States.”
The American Civil Liberties Union called the new rule “patently unlawful” and vowed to file a lawsuit against it, while a host of experts also questioned its legality.
“The interim regulation violates the clear language of the law in several respects,” Stephen Legomsky, a former chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, told Reuters in an email.
The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR said it was “deeply concerned” about the measure, saying it would “put vulnerable families at risk” and undermine international efforts to find a coordinated solution.
Designated an “interim final rule,” the measure goes into effect on Tuesday, potentially shifting the burden onto poorly equipped countries like Mexico and Guatemala to process asylum claims.
The rule would make it all but impossible for asylum-seekers to gain legal entry to the United States unless they first apply for asylum in a “third country.”
The proposed changes represent the latest effort by the Trump administration to crack down on immigration, the signature issue that helped propel Trump to the White House in the 2016 election and one already figuring prominently in the 2020 campaign.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Trump administration had overreached its authority and violated the law.
“The President is devastating lives, dishonoring our values and departing from decades of precedent and law in his haste to destroy the lifeline of asylum in America,” Pelosi said in a statement.
While Democratic politicians have sought to portray the Trump policies as inhumane, the president’s supporters are certain to be pleased at another gesture making good on campaign promises to sharply curtail immigration.
Trump on Monday declared “very successful” what he had billed as a sweeping operation to arrest undocumented immigrants this past weekend. U.S. authorities launched small-scale operations aimed at about 2,000 recently arrived families in about 10 cities.

The operations come as the Trump administration faces criticism for housing immigrants in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions, and there are concerns about migrant children being separated from adults by U.S. authorities.
The administration says U.S. capacity to process asylum claims has been overwhelmed due to an influx of people from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador but also increasingly from Cuba and countries as far away as Africa and India.

Although the three Central American countries suffer from poverty, gang violence and domestic abuse, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said many asylum claims were “meritless.”
The administration chose a path just short of a “nuclear option, close to something like shutting down the border,” said Jessica Vaughan from the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports increased immigration restrictions.
“We don’t want to turn away people who are genuinely in danger but we know from experience that most of the people that are arriving at our border are not in that category. We have to find an effective way to deter frivolous or opportunist asylum-seekers,” Vaughan said.
Mexico has been somewhat cooperative with U.S. efforts to slow Central American immigration, in part under pressure from Trump threats to impose tariffs on Mexican products. But Mexico pushed back on Monday, saying asylum-seekers rejected by the United States should have to go back to their home countries, not Mexico.

Mexican Foreign Minister Marcel Ebrard said the new U.S. rule would not unilaterally convert Mexico into a designated “safe third country,” a status that would oblige asylum-seekers passing through its territory to seek refuge in Mexico, not the United States.
Guatemala, which both sends migrants to the United States and receives Hondurans and Salvadorans passing through, said on Sunday it would postpone President Jimmy Morales’ visit to Washington to discuss Guatemala’s potential designation as a “safe third country” for asylum seekers, stressing it had no plans to sign such an agreement.
Lawyers and rights activists say neither Mexico or Guatemala offer adequate conditions to provide safe harbor for many asylum-seekers, or strong enough institutions to process large numbers of asylum claims.
In January Trump required many asylum-seekers to wait out their cases in Mexico, known as the “Remain in Mexico” policy or the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), with nearly 20,000 people sent back so far. It was not immediately clear how the new rule would affect MPP."
4466,Trump administration moves to end protections for Central American asylum seekers',CBS News,7/15/2019,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-moves-to-end-protections-for-central-american-asylum-seekers/,"The Trump administration on Monday moved to end asylum protections for most Central American migrants in a major escalation of the president's battle to tamp down the number of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.
According to a new rule published in the Federal Register, asylum seekers who pass through another country first will be ineligible for asylum at the U.S. southern border. The rule, expected to go into effect on Tuesday, also applies to children who have crossed the border alone. The new rule will affect asylum seekers coming through Mexico from countries like Guatemala and El Salvador.
There are some exceptions: If someone has been trafficked, if the country the migrant passed through did not sign one of the major international treaties that govern how refugees are managed (though most Western countries have signed them) or if an asylum-seeker sought protection in a country but was denied, then a migrant could still apply for U.S. asylum.

But the move by President Trump's administration was meant to essentially end asylum protections as they now are on the southern border. Mr. Trump has long vented his frustrations with the U.S. asylum system, insisting Democrats need to change the laws.
The policy is almost certain to face a legal challenge, and shortly after the new rule was announced, the American Civil Liberties Union said it intends to sue.
""The Trump administration is trying to unilaterally reverse our country's legal and moral commitment to protect those fleeing danger. This new rule is patently unlawful and we will sue swiftly,"" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project.
U.S. law allows refugees to request asylum when they arrive at the U.S. regardless of how they did so, but there is an exception for those who have come through a country considered to be ""safe."" But the Immigration and Nationality Act, which governs asylum law, is vague on how a country is determined ""safe""; it says ""pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement.""
""While the recent supplemental funding was absolutely vital to helping confront the crisis, the truth is that it will not be enough without targeted changes to the legal framework of our immigration system,"" Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said in a statement. ""Until Congress can act, this interim rule will help reduce a major 'pull' factor driving irregular migration to the United States and enable DHS and DOJ to more quickly and efficiently process cases originating from the southern border, leading to fewer individuals transiting through Mexico on a dangerous journey.""
The Mexican government says Mexican policy remains unchanged, and Mexico will not send people back to countries where they fear prosecution.
Attorney General William Barr insisted the new rule will ""decrease forum shopping by economic migrants and those who seek to exploit our asylum system to obtain entry to the United States—while ensuring that no one is removed from the United States who is more likely than not to be tortured or persecuted on account of a protected ground.""
Right now, the U.S. has such an agreement, known as a ""safe third country,"" only with Canada. Under a recent agreement with Mexico, Central American countries were considering a regional compact on the issue, but nothing has been decided. Guatemalan officials were expected in Washington on Monday, but apparently a meeting between Mr. Trump and Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales was canceled amid a court challenge in Guatemala over whether the country could agree to a safe third with the U.S.
The new rule also will apply to the initial asylum screening, known as a ""credible fear"" interview, at which migrants must prove they have credible fears of returning to their home country. It applies to migrants who are arriving to the U.S., not those who are already in the country.
Trump administration officials say the changes are meant to close the gap between the initial asylum screening that most people pass and the final decision on asylum that most people do not win. But immigrant rights groups, religious leaders and humanitarian groups have said the Republican administration's policies amount to a cruel and calloused effort to keep immigrants out of the country. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador are poor countries suffering from violence.
Along with the administration's recent effort to send asylum seekers back over the border, Mr. Trump has tried to deny asylum to anyone crossing the border illegally and restrict who can claim asylum, and Attorney General William Barr recently tried to keep thousands of asylum seekers detained while their cases play out.
Nearly all of those efforts have been blocked by courts.
Immigration courts are backlogged by more than 800,000 cases, meaning many people won't have their asylum claims heard for years, despite the fact that more judges are being hired.
People are generally eligible for asylum in the U.S. if they fear return to their home country because they have been persecuted or have a well-founded fear that they will be persecuted on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group.
During the budget year for 2009, there were 35,811 asylum claims, and 8,384 were granted. During 2018 budget year, there were 162,060 claims filed, and 13,168 were granted."

6457,ICE to Launch Roundup of Undocumented Immigrants Sunday',Wall Street Journal - News,7/12/2019,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/ice-to-launch-round-up-of-undocumented-immigrants-sunday-11562849273,"WASHINGTON—Immigration and Customs Enforcement will launch an effort to round up thousands of undocumented migrants across the country on Sunday as part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration, according to three administration officials.
Details of this weekend’s operations remain unknown, but the officials said that the orders include detention and deportations. One of the officials said ICE has been ordered to go after people “who received a final order of deportation from an immigration judge after..."
6718,"ICE raids are looming. Panicked immigrants are skipping work, hiding out and bracing for the worst'",CNN (Web News),7/12/2019,,,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/12/us/immigration-ice-raids-fear/index.html,"(CNN) Weeks ago, as President Donald Trump warned that ICE agents were preparing raids across the country , a 41-year-old housekeeper and babysitter in Miami headed to the grocery store with her daughter.
They knew they'd be staying inside and needed to stock up on supplies.
""I felt that day like it was a hurricane coming,"" the undocumented immigrant from Nicaragua told CNN.
Since then, the raids Trump threatened haven't happened . But for millions of undocumented immigrants living across the United States, the storm is still brewing.
With a new threat of immigration raids on Sunday , immigrant rights advocates and undocumented immigrants told CNN that fear in their communities is growing.
And undocumented immigrants are bracing themselves.
They're calling hotlines, afraid to go outside and unsure of where to turn. Some are staying home from work. Others are posting signs by doors inside their homes telling them what to do if ICE agents show up.
She woke up last night, screaming
While the uneasy mix of panic and preparation weeks ago felt like a hurricane, there was one notable difference for the housekeeper in Miami. The store in her neighborhood seemed eerily empty. Already, she said, people were afraid to go out.
She returned home with a plan.
""I said, 'OK, you know what, we're going to keep the windows down, the blinds down. I don't want any noise. I want everybody to stay calm and try to turn off the lights in the living room, so if they come, they don't know that we are in the house,'"" she said. ""I know my rights. I know that I don't have to open the door. I know a lot of things, but even with that it's really scary.""
The woman shared her story with CNN but asked to be identified only by a pseudonym, Elena, out of fear she could face repercussions for speaking out. She said she came to the United States more than two decades ago on a visa, which she overstayed as she sought asylum.
Elena lost her case but stayed in the United States, where she says she's built a life and grown her family. She's terrified of being separated from them.
""This is a horrible feeling,"" she said Thursday. ""These past two days, I've been waking up in the middle of the night. My husband says, 'What happened to you last night? You started screaming in your dream.'""
A man is detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on October 14, 2015, in Los Angeles, California.
Frightened farm workers are staying home
Élfido García sat in the scorching sun Thursday tending to agave plants in Homestead, Florida. For weeks, he's been picking up extra work to fill in for colleagues who he says are too scared to leave home after hearing about the possibility of raids on TV.
The migrant worker from Guatemala says he only leaves home to walk to work, knowing that along the way he risks the possibility of arrest by authorities.
""Yes, I'm taking the risk,"" he said, ""but just to fight for my family.""
As the threat of immigration raids looms in South Florida, fields once filled with workers look empty. Weeds are popping up where crops once grew. And the number of ""help wanted"" signs posted offering work are on the rise.
A growing number of workers are scared to leave their homes, leaving farm owners in search of laborers to harvest their crops.
Farm owner Gustavo Serna told CNN en Español that crops are being lost as a result.
""Because of the lack of workers, many times people are losing up to 50% of their harvest,"" he said.
Across the country, in Worthington, Minnesota, an undocumented agriculture worker who spoke with CNN said the community there is terrified, too. He said he's planning to hunker down all weekend until he is certain ICE agents aren't in the streets.
""I don't want to leave my family devastated,"" he said, ""so we are just going to stay inside.""
Élfido García says he's been hunkering down at home as reports of possible immigration raids resurface. He only leaves to walk to work.
Questions and frantic calls
Advocates note that fears of deportation are familiar in immigrant communities across the country. And this isn't the first time raids have been threatened or reported on before they occur.
But this time around, many advocates say the concerns they're hearing from immigrants are more intense.
""There is a lot of panic and a lot of fear, even though we know that these raids happen every year. ... Something feels tangibly different this time around,"" said Nayim Islam, an immigrant rights organizer for Desis Rising Up & Moving, an advocacy group that works with South Asian and Indo-Caribbean communities in New York City.
Many groups have set up hotlines for community members to report raids and reach out for help.
""We got a call from a mom who said that her little girl wasn't feeling well and she was afraid to go to the doctor. She was trying to figure out how to make it there,"" said Melissa Taveras, a spokeswoman for the Florida Immigrant Coalition.
""We keep getting calls and messages from folks, saying, 'We're scared. What should we do?'"" Taveras said. ""I've seen those sorts of messages and calls more than usual, which really worries me, because those are people that are preparing in fear.""
Across the country, advocacy groups have been hosting ""Know Your Rights"" trainings and circulating fliers and social medial posts with guidelines about what they say immigrants should do if ICE agents show up at their door.
The word seems to have gotten out, said Abel Nuñez, executive director of the Central American Resource Center in Washington.
""A lot of people have heard that message,"" he said. ""I think the question is, if it does happen to them, are they going to implement it? It's one thing for me to give you a card or a paper with your rights. It's another thing at five in the morning, when you hear a loud knock at your door and someone's yelling, ' Police!' Are you going to let them in? That's a very different environment.
""At this point, it's just about repetition, reminding them of what they have, so that it's muscle memory.""
'This is not a life'
Now that another ICE operation appears to be imminent, Elena says she doesn't want to risk staying home to find out what would happen if federal agents show up at her door.
""This week we're planning to move out for a week until this stops, but next month we're going to move from the apartment,"" she said. ""I've been in that apartment for five years now, so I don't think it's secure.""
Fear, she says, has become a constant. She's so exhausted that sometimes she wishes she could go back to Nicaragua.
But she says recent unrest there has made her scared to return to the country she left decades ago.
""Sometimes I feel that way. I want to say...'I give up. I'm going back.' Because this is not a life. ... I'm driving. I have no driver's license.
""My daughter sometimes says, 'Mom, I'm scared you're not going to come back home,'"" Elena says. ""I don't know if I'm going to get the opportunity to feel that I have a free life, that I live in peace."""
5909,Why those ICE raids are being announced in advance',Fox News (Online),7/12/2019,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/why-those-ice-raids-are-being-announced-in-advance,"Starting Sunday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is expected to resume its previously announced plan to apprehend thousands of illegal immigrants across the country.
The reinvigorated effort comes just weeks after President Trump tweeted that ICE was preparing to kick off days of raids in at least 10 major cities. The operation was halted, however, the day before it was set to start, to give Congress time to arrive at a legislative solution on immigration. Trump said his administration would relaunch the raids after a two-week window – after the Independence Day observance – and that time now seems to have arrived.
So why are the raids being publicized days in advance?
“It’s unprecedented. But there is a political purpose behind it,” Thomas Kilbride, a retired Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agent and ICE policy adviser, told Fox News. He said the president has tried to get Democrats to come to the table because asylum laws need to change, and this is a way to bargain.
WAR CRIMINALS AMONG US: INSIDE THE QUIET EFFORT TO PROSECUTE AND DEPORT VIOLATORS DISGUISED AS REFUGEES
ICE agents are expected to target a minimum of 2,000 immigrants who have already been listed for deportation, but Kilbride said there will be “collateral” fallout.
What does that mean, though? While there are roughly a million people in the United States with removal orders, according to officials, those with criminal histories are the ones being sought. If other illegals are located along with a person of interest, they, too, will be arrested as part of that fallout.
But whether any political ambitions connected to the operation will prove successful remains to be seen.
“At a minimum, the asylum laws need to change, for people to have to remain outside the country when applying for asylum or applying at a foreign embassy,” Kilbride said. “What we are seeing at the border now is unprecedented.”
Other experts have underscored that Trump’s announcements are something of a gesture – and not something that the administration was under any legal obligation to do.
“The main point here is that the Trump administration is trying to circumvent some of the blowback from the other side of the aisle. It sends the message that these people have been notified to self-deport and if they fail to do that, this might happen,” said Steve Bucci, homeland security expert at the Heritage Foundation. “It is saying that we aren’t monsters, what we are doing is in accordance with the law and in a reasonable fashion.
""Past administrations didn’t announce raids because they didn’t have to, they just did them.”
Yet the heads-up also means that many may have left the addresses known to DHS in the weeks since the raids were first trumpeted, further hindering their effectiveness.
“Some may go into hiding or to a church providing a sanctuary,” Bucci continued.
Erin Corcoran, an immigration expert and executive director of Notre Dame's Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, affirmed that in the past, raids were not announced beforehand by immigration enforcement, just as they are not announced when law enforcement is involved; when the information is exposed, it can more often than not prove detrimental to an operation.
“Sometimes there have been leaks by individuals, but it has never been a policy choice to pre-emptively announce raids. It compromises the effectiveness of the raids. Those being targeted may relocate or refuse to answer the door when immigration officials knock because they are anticipating the raids,” she said. “Raids have been conducted by other administrations, oftentimes targeting certain types of immigration violations, including those with criminal convictions. However, there has not been an immigration raid by previous administrations targeting families or children.
""It is unclear why this administration is preemptively announcing these raids. I also think there is some disagreement within the administration officials about these raids.""
VENEZUELA’S WAR ON CHILDREN AT 'BREAKING POINT' OVER LACK OF MEDICAL CARE
The public announcement of the forthcoming raids has inspired a number of hashtag campaigns, from #protecteachother to #knowyourights, aimed at giving undocumented migrants information about civil liberties that include the rights to silence and an attorney.
Acting Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli said this week that the raids were “absolutely going to happen,” though he did not give an exact date for when “operational elements will roll out.”
Matthew Bourke, a spokesperson for ICE, told reporters Wednesday that his agency ""prioritizes the arrest and removal of unlawfully present aliens who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security” but he also declined to comment on specific details, citing “law enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security"" of ICE personnel.
In fact, some officials have expressed concern that declaring the missions publicly is a serious concern where officer safety is involved.

At the same time, however, some lawmakers and legal experts speculate that the leak of information from within could also be designed to have the raids halted once again.
Immigration lawyer Saman Nasseri, who's based in San Diego, contended that releasing information about the raids in advance is problematic not only for security reasons, but because of how often people move on, complicating the tracking of targets. He anticipates that the “operation will most likely be delayed again.”
The notion of immigration reform is set to be at the forefront of Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign and has long been a staple of his presidential agenda. While the migrant flow has shown signs of slowing over the past month, the Trump team has long grappled with the issue of large numbers of immigrants – mostly from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador – crossing the southern border with Mexico. More than 330,000 families have entered the U.S. illegally since the beginning of October, government records show.
DHS did not respond to a request for further comment."

Speaking at his daily press conference, Lopez Obrador said he expected an agreement with factories to be signed next week.
“This agreement is going to be signed, there will be no legal problem,” he said. “We are arranging this so that they can be hired without much processing.”
Mexico’s border states have been inundated with migrants who must often wait weeks to seek U.S. asylum under a policy known as “metering,” which limits the number who can apply each day. After requesting asylum, thousands have been sent back to Mexico while they wait for their cases to be settled, a process that can take months or years.
The bottleneck shows no signs of easing. Mexico pledged earlier this month to do more to halt the flow of migrants to the United States after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to slap tariffs on Mexican exports.
Factories in northern Mexico have grappled with labor shortages, so migrants could prove a boon for employers.
Although Lopez Obrador has doubled the minimum wage along the U.S. border, pay there remains lower than the minimum wage in Central American countries such as Guatemala and Honduras, from which many of the migrants are fleeing.
What’s more, many migrants lack authorization to work in the country, and border cities including Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez have struggled to house them in shelters as their numbers swell.
Lopez Obrador added that plans were underway to build shelters and provide additional resources to the overtaxed facilities already in operation.
“Funds are being authorized so there will be resources in the shelters, so they do not lack food, medicine, medical attention,” he said.
Lopez Obrador also expressed a desire to guarantee work and shelter for migrants in southern Mexico.
Immigration centers in the region have become increasingly overcrowded as Mexican officials ramp up the detention of migrants headed for the northern border."

“This agreement is going to be signed, there will be no legal problem,” he said Friday. “We are arranging this so that they can be hired without much processing.”
Such a deal would provide a solution to some of the tens of thousands of migrants who are seeking asylum in the U.S. but have been sent back into Mexico as they await court dates on their asylum claims.
Finding a solution to securing the U.S.-Mexico border and dealing illegal immigration remains a hot topic in the U.S. Mexico promised to curb illegal immigration into the U.S. after President Trump threatened to slap tariffs on the country if they did not stop the surge."

“And for the shrieking Republicans who don’t know the difference: concentration camps are not the same as death camps. Concentration camps are considered by experts as ‘the mass detention of civilians without trial.’ And that’s exactly what this administration is doing,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote, pointing to an Esquire article quoting historians who said the U.S. detention facilities at the southern border meet the definition of a concentration camp.

The back-and-forth comes as lawmakers consider Trump’s request for $4.5 billion in emergency funds to help deal with the flow of migrants at the southern border. Trump’s request includes $3.3 billion for humanitarian aid to help with care for unaccompanied minors and families crossing the border, as well as $1.1 billion for other operations like increasing the number of detention beds.

Republicans and the White House have used the remarks to nakedly cast Democrats as an enemy of Israel and American Jews, who in presidential elections have largely voted for Democratic candidates, according to exit polls. Democrats are likely to face questions about whether they agree with Ocasio-Cortez’s comments about concentration camps and the Trump administration’s detention centers as they return to Washington this week.
On Tuesday, Democrats pointed to a recent New York Times report documenting how a 4-month-old Romanian boy who arrived at the southern border with his father was separated for months from his family under the Trump administration’s family separations policy.

6759,Trump defends deal with Mexico that critics say will do little to curb migrant crisis',Washington Post,6/10/2019,,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-defends-deal-with-mexico-that-critics-say-will-do-little-to-curb-migrant-crisis/2019/06/09/0fd7d12e-8ada-11e9-8f69-a2795fca3343_story.html,"Whether the deal will greatly reduce the number of migrants entering the United States remains to be seen. But it nonetheless represents a serious effort by Mexico to do more on an issue central to Trump’s reelection campaign after he threatened to impose a 5 percent across-the-board tariff on one of the United States’ top trading partners.
AD
AD
Mexico announced Friday night that it would implement “strong measures” to reduce the flow of migrants across its territory toward the southern U.S. border, including the unprecedented deployment of thousands of Mexican national guard troops. It also agreed to expand a program allowing Central American migrants to stay in Mexico while they await the adjudication of their asylum claims.
“The president put a charge in his whole dialogue with Mexico with the tariff threats, brought them to the table,” Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said in an interview on “Fox News Sunday.” “The foreign minister of Mexico arrived within hours. He arrived the next day with real proposals on the table. This is the first time we’ve heard anything like this kind of number of law enforcement being deployed in Mexico to address migrations.”
With arrests at the U.S.-Mexico border soaring and Trump lashing out — at Democrats, foreign governments and U.S. laws — Homeland Security officials are under enormous pressure to halt the migration boom. The Trump administration’s efforts to deter migration have not worked, either being shot down in the courts or failing to get through Congress. And Mexican officials brushed off some of the president’s earlier demands.
AD
AD
Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on Mexico to gain leverage in immigration negotiations drew criticism from lawmakers in both parties, who called it a dangerous escalation that could damage the U.S. economy.
But in some morning tweets, Trump said that Mexico “was not being cooperative on the Border” before the deal reached Friday. Now, he said, “I have full confidence, especially after speaking to their President yesterday, that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done.”
Trump said he could move to reimpose tariffs if Mexico doesn’t follow through on its promises. Some aspects of the deal, he added, remain to be announced — “one in particular,” he said, “will be announced at the appropriate time.”
AD
In a tweet Monday morning, Trump said the change would require “a vote by Mexico’s Legislative body!”
AD
“We do not anticipate a problem with the vote but, if for any reason the approval is not forthcoming, Tariffs will be reinstated!” he said.
The president’s tweets seemed to hint at a possible component of the deal that would transform asylum rules across the region and make applicants seek refuge in the first country they reach. Such an accord would allow the United States to deport most asylum seekers from Guatemala to Mexico, and those from Honduras and El Salvador would be flown to Guatemala.
Homeland Security officials think such an arrangement would lead to a dramatic drop in migrants arriving each month at the U.S. border. Those migrants are generally released from custody if they have a child with them.
AD
Democrats criticized the agreement as more evidence of the president’s anti-immigration agenda while questioning how much impact it would have.
AD
“These are agreements that Mexico had already made, in some cases months ago,” former congressman Beto O’Rourke, who is running for president, said in an interview on ABC’s “This Week.” “They might have accelerated the timetable, but by and large the president achieved nothing except to jeopardize the most important trading relationship that the United States of America has.”
Immigrant rights advocates argued Sunday that while it was important that the United States and Mexico pledged to invest resources in Central America, the deal fails to address the root cause of the problem, which is poverty and violence in the region that the migrants are fleeing.
AD
“In general, I don’t think that this agreement stems the flow,” Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, said in an interview. “The situation in Central America is pretty dire. There are no examples in modern history of us being able to enforce our way out of a migration crisis like this.”
AD
But those who support a harder line on immigration said the agreement was a positive sign.
“I think Mexico sees that our two countries have a shared interest in clamping down on this,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors restricted immigration. “We’ll see in a couple of months whether it makes a difference, but I think it can. I’m cautiously optimistic.”
AD
Homeland Security officials say the deal, if fully implemented, represents a breakthrough in their pressure campaign to get Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to take a more robust enforcement approach.
In particular, the pledge to deploy 6,000 national guard forces in southern Mexico could make it more difficult for smugglers to continue transporting groups of Central American migrants on buses with little interference from authorities.
AD
Mexico has also given assurances it will expand immigration detention centers and bolster deportation efforts.
The newly formed national guard was created by López Obrador primarily in response to domestic pressure to reduce crime and Mexico’s soaring homicide rate, so committing those forces to immigration enforcement — which López Obrador described last year during his campaign as doing “dirty work” for the United States — amounts to a significant concession, and has generated criticism.
AD
Mexico had already promised to use the national guard, but the deployment size is much larger than what the government had offered previously.
U.S. officials also view the full expansion of the MPP program, known informally as “Remain in Mexico,” as a difference-maker, allowing them to potentially require thousands more asylum seekers to wait outside U.S. territory while their claims for protection are fully adjudicated, a process that can take years. Mexico to date has been resisting U.S. efforts to expand the program across the entire border.
AD
The MPP program has so far survived court challenges, but a panel of federal judges in California has raised doubts about its legality, and Homeland Security officials have been bracing for an injunction that could halt the program.
AD
For U.S. officials, the question is whether the agreement will bring the rapid reduction in unauthorized border crossings that Trump is demanding, and whether it will be sustained once the president’s threats abate.
Over the weekend, the deal prompted congressional Republicans to call for action on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, Trump’s new North American trade deal, which has yet to be approved by Congress.
Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a Senate Finance Committee member and former U.S. trade representative, said in a statement Friday that he hoped the migration accord would “pave the way for the House and Senate to move quickly to pass the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement.”
AD
The White House took a step this month to begin the process of congressional approval, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) warned as recently as Wednesday that approval was in doubt in the House unless several concerns about the negotiated agreement are addressed.
“We hope to have a path to yes to get it done,” she told reporters. “But you have to have enforcement as part of the agreement, not as part of a sidebar letter or bills that we might pass in each country — part of the agreement.”
A senior Democratic aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal conversations, said Sunday that the migration deal was “totally irrelevant” to leaders’ concerns about the USMCA.
Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, appeared relieved in talk-show appearances Sunday.
Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), who had spoken out against Trump’s tariff threats, called the deal “a big win for both sides” and said it sent a message to China, whose leaders are wrangling with Trump over trade.
“Even though I’m not a big supporter of tariffs, he is, and his willingness to use that probably helped produce a result,” Blunt said on “Face the Nation.” “I hope we don’t have to go back to that as an issue again with Mexico.”
With an apparently successful outcome in hand, Trump still couldn’t avoid overselling the deal. In a tweet Saturday morning, the president claimed that Mexico had agreed to “IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!”
But Mexico’s ambassador to the United States, Martha Bárcena, declined to confirm that account. In an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” she said only that agricultural trade “is going to grow without tariffs and with USMCA ratification.”
“But there was no transaction that was signed off on as part of this deal, is what I understand you’re saying,” host Margaret Brennan asked. “You’re just talking about trade.”
Bárcena nodded a few times before answering. “I’m talking about trade, and I am absolutely certain that the trade in agricultural goods would increase dramatically in the next few months,” she said.
Later, in a tweet, Bárcena maintained that she “did not contradict” Trump on the issue — underscoring Mexican officials’ hesitance to appear critical of the president so soon after avoiding a major trade war."
4163,White House Touts Mexico Immigration Deal and Claims More to Come',CBN,6/10/2019,,,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/june/white-house-touts-mexico-immigration-deal-and-claims-more-to-come,"WASHINGTON – The White House's plan to impose a five percent tax on Mexican goods came to a halt Friday as the administration and Mexican officials reached an agreement to curb illegal immigration.
The president is taking a victory lap over what he sees as successful negotiations and saying more is on the way.
We have fully signed and documented another very important part of the Immigration and Security deal with Mexico, one that the U.S. has been asking about getting for many years. It will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by Mexico’s Legislative body!.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 10, 2019
""We have fully signed and documented another very important part of the Immigration and Security Deal with Mexico… it will be revealed in the not too distant future,"" Trump tweeted Monday.
His critics say when it comes to Friday's agreement, there's nothing new.
But DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan defended it on Fox News Sunday saying, ""All of it is new.""
The administration took the airwaves and Twitter to push back on a New York Times report which said most of the agreement had been negotiated months ago.
""The president put a charge in this whole dialogue with Mexico with the tariff threat,"" McAleenan said.
""This is the first time we've heard anything like this kind of number of law enforcement being deployed to Mexico to address migration,"" he continued.
According to the Joint Declaration released by the State Department, 6,000 Mexican National Guard members are heading to the Guatemalan border and throughout the country. Mexico has agreed to take decisive action to dismantle human trafficking organizations and both sides agree to the expansion of the migrant protection protocols.
Trump's supporters in Washington say the very threat of tariffs succeeded in pressuring the Mexican government to take stronger actions.
""He's using tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations and I think he used them as leverage in this situation brilliantly,"" said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI).
Trump's opponents contend the end doesn't justify the means.
""They might have accelerated the timetable. But by and large, the president achieved nothing except to jeopardize the most important trading relationship that the United States of America has,"" presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke told ABC's ""This Week.""
""What I am tired of is a president who consistently goes to war, verbal war, with our allies,"" added presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union.""
There's one thing both sides agree on: More work has to be done by Congress. The controversy stems over the what and the how."
4282,Trump defends Mexico migration deal and pledges more detail',Reuters,6/10/2019,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-mexico/trump-defends-mexico-migration-deal-and-pledges-more-detail-idUSKCN1TA0GM,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump defended his administration’s deal with Mexico against criticism that there were no major new commitments to stem a flow of Central American migrants crossing into the United States, and said on Sunday more details would soon be released.
Key aspects of the agreement are still unclear, including whether Mexico has pledged to buy more U.S. agricultural products and if the deal materially expanded a previous commitment by Mexico to more vigorously police its southern border with Guatemala.
Top Democratic senators said many aspects of the deal were not new, while the Mexican ambassador to the United States declined to confirm whether it contained any commitments on agricultural goods.
The deal, announced on Friday after three days of talks in Washington, averted Trump’s threatened imposition of 5% import tariffs on all Mexican goods that had been due to start on Monday unless Mexico committed to do more to help reduce an increase in migrants arriving at the U.S. southern border.
“Mexico was not being cooperative on the Border...and now I have full confidence, especially after speaking to their President yesterday, that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done,” Trump said on Twitter.
“Importantly, some things not mentioned in yesterday press release, one in particular, were agreed upon. That will be announced at the appropriate time,” he added.
Trump did not elaborate and the White House and State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Friday’s joint communique broadly sketched the terms of the agreement, but contained few details.
The Mexican peso jumped against the dollar in Asian markets and U.S. equity futures rose on Sunday following the deal.
The agreement expedites a program known as the Migration Protection Protocols that was announced in December. That program sends migrants seeking asylum in the United States to wait in Mexico while their cases are being processed.
Friday’s agreement would see the United States immediately expand the implementation of the MPP across its entire 2,000-mile (3,220-km) southern border, the State Department said on Friday.
But as of Sunday night, U.S.-bound asylum seekers were not yet being sent back to additional Mexican border towns, three Mexican officials said.
Officials in the Mexican border states of Sonora, south of the U.S. states of Arizona and New Mexico, and Tamaulipas, south of Texas, said they were unaware of plans to expand the number of border crossings where the asylum seekers must be returned to Mexican territory to await processing.
The deal will also see Mexico deploy the National Guard police force to its southern border, where many Central American migrants enter Mexico.
UNCERTAINTY OVER AGRICULTURE
On Saturday, a New York Times report, citing officials from both countries familiar with the negotiations, said most of Friday’s deal had already been sketched out in March, when Mexico agreed to deploy its National Guard throughout the country, with priority given to the southern border.
Trump tweeted on Sunday that the Times report was false, adding: “We have been trying to get some of these Border Actions for a long time, as have other administrations, but were not able to get them, or get them in full, until our signed agreement with Mexico.”
But it was business as usual over the weekend at the busiest crossing point along Mexico’s porous southern border with Guatemala. Evidence of Mexico’s promised crackdown on new arrivals trying to reach the United States was nowhere to be seen, as a small fleet of rafts carried migrants hoping to escape the violence of Central America.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer also said there appeared to be little new in the deal, adding it was a “bogus” solution used by Trump to get out of an ill-conceived tariff threat.
“This is likely to have only a small impact on solving the root causes of Central American migration because many of the components are things Mexico had already said they would do,” Schumer said on Twitter.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Twitter, however, that Trump’s “strong stand got Mexico to do things they have never done before.”
There is further uncertainty around Trump’s comments on Saturday that Mexico had agreed to “immediately begin” buying “large quantities” of agricultural goods from U.S. farmers.

Mexican officials have not confirmed any new agreement on agricultural products. Asked repeatedly about such a deal on CBS on Sunday, the Mexican ambassador to the United States, Martha Bárcena Coqui, said only that trade would increase without the tariffs. She said there were many details discussed during negotiations that were not in the written declaration.
She noted Mexico was already a top U.S. trade partner in agricultural products. Mexico is the top importer of U.S. corn, wheat, pork and dairy by volume.
On Saturday, Mexico’s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, tweeted that the deal should boost economic growth and therefore demand for U.S. agricultural products, but he also stopped short of saying that the deal contained a commitment on Mexico’s part to purchase more goods from the United States."
2569,"Mexico blocks 1,000-migrant caravan ahead of Trump's tariff deadline""",Washington Examiner,6/6/2019,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mexico-blocks-1-000-migrant-caravan-ahead-of-trumps-tariff-deadline,"Mexico apprehended about 1,000 migrants after President Trump threatened to slap tariffs on the country over its lax border policies.
About 200 Mexican military police intercepted the caravan walking north along a highway in southern Mexico on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. The migrants told officers they planned to travel to the U.S. and claim asylum.
Some migrants resisted and others fled into the forest on either side of the highway, but the vast majority of those in the caravan complied with orders from Mexican officials. Hundreds of migrants agreed to go to a migrant detention center.
At the detention center, the migrants will be processed and, if needed, be transported back to their home countries.
The mass arrest comes days before Trump plans to place 5% tariff on all Mexican imports. Last week, Trump threatened Mexico with tariffs starting at 5% on June 10 and increasing 5% each month up to 25% until Mexico restricts the flow of migrants traveling through it to the U.S.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is answering Trump’s call for stricter border security. López Obrador has sent a delegation to meet with White House officials and appears to be tightening border enforcement. López Obrador said Thursday he expected a deal to be reached by the end of the day.

MEXICO CITY — Mexican soldiers, armed police and migration officials blocked hundreds of migrants after they crossed the border from Guatemala in a caravan into southern Mexico on Wednesday, and detained dozens of them, a witness from a migrant aid group and an official said.
The Mexican response in the border town of Metapa, which included dozens of soldiers, marked a toughening of the government's efforts to curb the flow of mainly Central American migrants, said Salva Cruz, a coordinator with Fray Matias de Cordova.
""That many sailors and military police, yes, it's new,"" Cruz said, by WhatsApp, from Metapa, in the southern border state of Chiapas, where the vast majority of migrants from Central America cross into Mexico. Many are asylum seekers fleeing violence and poverty in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The operation in Chiapas coincided with a meeting of Mexican and U.S. officials at the White House on Wednesday to thrash out a deal that would avoid blanket tariffs on Mexico threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump last week.
Trump announced the tariffs in retaliation for what he called Mexico's failure to stop Central American migrants from reaching the U.S. border.

Mexico's National Migration Institute (INM) said in a statement that a group of about 300 people entered Mexico by a border bridge Wednesday morning, and another 120 people joined the group as they walked to the city of Tapachula.
The migrants later agreed to be taken by bus to a migration office to be processed, the INM said.
U.S. border officers apprehended more than 132,000 people crossing from Mexico in May, a third more than in April and the highest monthly level since 2006, reaching what U.S. officials said on Wednesday were ""crisis"" levels.
An INM official in Mexico City who was unauthorized to talk to the media said, on condition of anonymity, that the migrants were being asked to show their status in Mexico.
Migration officials detained 350 to 400 people, the official said, noting that federal police and agents from the National Guard were present. Mexico's government recently created a militarized police force called the National Guard made up of soldiers and federal police.
On Wednesday afternoon in Mexico City, police detained Irineo Mujica, director of the U.S.-Mexico migrant aid group Pueblo Sin Fronteras, and Cristobal Sanchez, a migrant rights activist, according to Alex Mensing, a coordinator with the group.
Pueblo Sin Fronteras has for several years guided annual caravans through Mexico, seeking to protect migrants and to advocate for their rights along a 2,000-mile trail ridden with criminals and corrupt officials who prey on lone travelers through kidnapping, extortion and other forms of assault.
Since April 2018 Trump has lashed out at the caravans of Central Americans wending their way to the United States, while blaming Mexico for failing to stop their movement to the U.S. border.

4079,Second federal appeals court rules against Trump administration over DACA rollback',Washington Examiner,5/17/2019,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/courts/second-federal-appeals-court-rules-against-trump-administration-over-daca-rollback,"A second federal appeals court on Friday ruled against the Trump administration in its attempt to roll back the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and said its decision to do so was unlawful.
A divided three-judge panel on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in its ruling that the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to rescind the DACA program violated federal law because “it was not adequately explained and thus was arbitrary and capricious.”
The Richmond-based federal appeals court is the second appeals court to rule against President Trump in his attempt to wind down the DACA program, which was implemented by the Obama administration in 2012 and protected immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children from the threat of deportation.
In November, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court order blocking the government from rescinding the DACA program. The San Francisco-based court said then that plaintiffs in that challenge to the administration’s efforts to end DACA were likely to succeed in their claim that the rescission “is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”
The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to take up the dispute over its attempted rollback, though the court has not acted on numerous petitions currently before it.
The Trump administration announced in 2017 that it would be ending the DACA program, and the Department of Homeland Security predicated its decision on the grounds DACA was unlawful to begin with.
But the president’s move was met with a host of lawsuits filed by immigrant-rights groups and individuals who argued DACA’s wind down violated federal law and the Constitution.
Federal district court judges in Washington, D.C., New York, and San Francisco delivered losses to the Trump administration and blocked it from moving forward with DACA’s rollback. But one judge in Greenbelt, Md., sided with the Trump administration and said the president acted within his authority to wind down the Obama-era program.
The 4th Circuit, however, reversed the ruling from the federal judge in Maryland that upheld DACA's rescission.
In its ruling against the Trump administration, the 4th Circuit said the Department of Homeland Security failed to account for those affected by the decision.
“Hundreds of thousands of people had structured their lives on the availability of deferred action during the over five years between implementation of DACA and the decision to rescind it,” the court said. “Although the government insists that Acting Secretary [Elaine] Duke considered these interests in connection with her decision to rescind DACA, her memo makes no mention of them.”
Judge Julius Richardson, a Trump appointee, dissented and said the executive branch's rollback of DACA is judicially unreviewable.
""We in the judicial branch have a narrowly circumscribed role. It is not our place to second-guess the wisdom of the discretionary decisions made by the other branches,"" Richardson wrote. ""The rescission of DACA was a controversial and contentious decision, but one that was committed to the executive branch.""

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — A federal appeals court ruled Friday the Trump administration acted in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner when it sought to end an Obama-era program that shields young immigrants from deportation.
A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2 to 1 that the Trump administration violated federal law when it tried to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program without adequately explaining why. The ruling overturns a lower court ruling a judge in Maryland made last year, which Trump had previously praised via Twitter.
Friday’s ruling will not have any immediate effect as other federal courts have already ordered that DACA be kept in place.

The 4th Circuit ruling said the Department of Homeland Security did not “adequately account” for how ending DACA program would affect the hundreds of thousands of young people who “structured their lives” around the program.
“We recognize the struggle is not over and there are more battles to fight in the Supreme Court on this road to justice, but our families are emboldened by knowing that they are on the right side of history,” said Gustavo Torres, executive director of Casa de Maryland, the lead plaintiff in the case.
Trump and his Justice Department have argued that the Obama administration acted unlawfully when it implemented DACA. The Justice Department declined to comment.
Preserving DACA is a top Democratic priority, but discussions between Trump and Democrats on the issue have gone nowhere.
Trump’s latest immigration plan, unveiled Thursday, does not address what to do about the hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters that “every single time that we have put forward or anyone else has put forward any type of immigration plan that has included DACA it’s failed.”
DACA’s fate could be decided by the Supreme Court, which is weighing the Trump administration’s appeals of other federal court rulings.
The justices have set no date to take action.
If the high court decides it wants to hear the appeals, arguments would not take place before the fall. That means a decision is not expected until 2020, which could come in the thick of next year’s presidential contest.

6455,"Trump Signals Even Fiercer Immigration Agenda, With a Possible Return of Family Separations'",New York Times (Online News),4/9/2019,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/us/politics/trump-asylum-seekers-federal-judge.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s purge of the nation’s top homeland security officials is a sign that he is preparing to unleash an even fiercer assault on immigration, including a possible return of his controversial decision last summer to separate migrant children from their parents, current and former administration officials said Monday.
Mr. Trump shook up the ranks of his top immigration officials after spending months demanding that they take tougher action to stop the surge in migrant families at the border and seething about what he considers their overly legalistic refusals to do what he has said was necessary.
That anger was underscored on Monday when a judge blocked Mr. Trump’s efforts to force asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases proceed — a practice that immigration advocates called inhumane and illegal. Judge Richard Seeborg of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that existing law did not give Mr. Trump the power to enforce the policy, known as “migrant protection protocols.”
The immediate targets of the president’s growing fury about the situation at the border were the officials who he saw as insufficiently steely minded: Kirstjen Nielsen, who resigned Sunday as the secretary of homeland security, and Ron Vitiello, whose nomination to permanently lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement was pulled after Mr. Trump remarked that “we want to go in a tougher direction.”"
2378,"Trump says no plan to revive family separations, blames Obama for uproar'",Fox News (Online),4/9/2019,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-no-plan-to-revive-family-separations-blames-obama-for-uproar,"President Trump said Tuesday that the administration has no plans to revive the controversial policy that allowed for family separations at the border, amid renewed speculation about whether the practice could return amid the shakeup at the Homeland Security department.
“We’re not looking to do that,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday prior to a closed-door meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN MAKES FIRST PUBLIC COMMENTS SINCE RESIGNATION AS DHS BOSS
He added that “once you don’t have it, many more people are coming, like a picnic. Like Disney Land.”
But he said, “We’re not looking to do it.”
The president ended the practice under pressure and mounting criticism last year.
But the issue of family separations has emerged once again after DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation and other changes in the department. The president also withdrew the nomination of acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Ron Vitellio to become the permanent head of the agency, telling reporters that “Ron’s a good man, but we’re going in a tougher direction, we want to go in a tougher direction.”
Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, though, Trump sought to pin the blame on his predecessor for the uproar.
“Obama separated the children, just so you understand. President Obama separated the children,” Trump said. “The cages that were shown, very inappropriate, they were built by President Obama and the Obama administration –not by Trump.”
“The press knows it, you know it, we all know it,” he said. “I’m the one that stopped it.”
Initial images of cages with children inside that spread on social media last year indeed were from the Obama administration. The photos, taken in 2014 by The Associated Press, were wrongly described as illustrating imprisonment under the Trump administration.
But while some family separations may have happened under Obama, it was not nearly as widespread as it was during the Trump administration, amid a “zero tolerance” policy that led to the separations.
Neither the Obama administration nor the Trump administration had an explicit family separation policy, but the “zero tolerance” policy meant that anyone caught crossing the border illegally was to be criminally prosecuted, even if they had few or no previous convictions. Under that policy, adults were taken to court for criminal proceedings, while their children were separated from them. If the charges took longer than 72 hours to process, children would be sent from the care of Customs and Border Protection to the Health and Human Services Department.
SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR TO STEP DOWN, ON HEELS OF NIELSEN RESIGNATION
Last June, Trump signed an executive order that stopped family separations.
Trump also slammed congressional Democrats Tuesday for not doing enough to ""act"" on border security.
""Homeland security is what we want--there's no better term, there's no better name,"" Trump said. ""We want homeland security and that’s what we’re gonna get.""

4349,Judge blocks Trump policy forcing asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico',USA TODAY,4/8/2019,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/08/judge-blocks-trump-policy-forcing-asylum-seekers-wait-mexico/3244127002/,"A federal judge on Monday blocked the Trump administration's policy requiring Central American asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico while their cases are decided in the U.S., ruling that Department of Homeland Security overstepped its legal authority.
That policy was one of the last attempts by outgoing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to gain control of the southern border, which has seen such an increase in illegal crossings that she resigned from her post over the weekend.
U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco ordered the Trump administration to allow the plaintiffs in the case — 11 migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras — to enter the U.S. within two days. He issued a nationwide preliminary injunction that prevents the administration from forcing future asylum-seekers back into Mexico. The order goes into effect on Friday.
Seeborg, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama, ruled that the Trump policy was not properly implemented and violated both U.S. laws and the 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees, which the U.S. is a party to. The asylum-seekers, Seeborg ruled, were already fleeing dangerous conditions in their home countries, only to be returned to Mexican border towns ""where they face undue risk to their lives and freedom.""
Trump complained of Seeborg's ruling Monday night on Twitter: ""A 9th Circuit Judge just ruled that Mexico is too dangerous for migrants. So unfair to the U.S. OUT OF CONTROL!"" he said.
The ruling marks the third straight time the Trump administration has been shot down in its attempts to limit or halt asylum-seekers who have been arriving at the U.S. border in record numbers.
""Try as it may, the Trump administration cannot simply ignore our laws in order to accomplish its goal of preventing people from seeking asylum in the United States,"" said Judy Rabinovitz, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project who argued the case.
In December, another federal judge struck down the Department of Justice's attempt to cut off asylum for victims of domestic abuse and gang violence. In November, another federal judge struck down Justice's attempts to cut off asylum for people who crossed into the country illegally, which is allowed under U.S. law.
In that case, U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar wrote that Trump ""may not rewrite the immigration laws.""
Monday's ruling follows a suit filed by Central American migrants who were among the first to be returned to Tijuana after requesting asylum at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in southern California, and several humanitarian groups that have been assisting migrants.
The policy, officially called the ""Migrant Protection Protocols"" but informally referred to as the ""Remain in Mexico"" plan, started in January at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in southern California. The policy has expanded to the Calexico Port of Entry about 120 miles east of San Ysidro, and Homeland Security officials say the plan is to gradually roll it out to all other ports along the U.S.-Mexico border.
It allows migrants from countries other than Mexico to request asylum at U.S ports of entry, but then requires them to return to Mexico to wait for a decision. Previously, asylum seekers were released into the U.S. and given a notice to appear in immigration court to proceed with their case.

More:'It was long past time for her to go': Dems welcome Kirstjen Nielsen's departure as DHS secretary
The U.S. and Mexican governments had been negotiating a joint plan, where Mexico would assume responsibility of the waiting asylum applicants, but when those talks broke down, the Trump administration announced in December it would unilaterally implement the policy, forcing Mexico and collection of humanitarian groups to care for those migrants in Mexico.
Nielsen has argued that the policy is needed — and allowed under law — to stem the flood of Central American migrants who are taking advantage of immigration ""loopholes"" by requesting asylum knowing they will be allowed to stay in the country.
In the 2017 fiscal year, Border Patrol agents apprehended 6,301 members of family units a month. In 2018, that rose to 8,934 a month. In the first five months of 2019, it jumped to 27,230 a month.
The Trump administration says those numbers represent a security and humanitarian crisis that forced them to implement the new policy forcing all those asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico.
""The (Migrant Protection Protocols are) a lawful implementation of DHS's broad prosecutorial discretion over when and how to initiate removal proceedings…and whether to limit entry into the country during the pendency of those proceedings,"" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a court filing.
Advocacy groups say the plan puts already-traumatized refugees in yet another traumatizing situation by fending for themselves in northern Mexico, a region that can be incredibly dangerous for people with no family there, no connections, and no protection.
""Instead of being able to focus on preparing their cases, asylum seekers forced to return to Mexico will have to focus on trying to survive,"" read the lawsuit. ""These pressures may deter even those with the strongest asylum claims to give up, rather than endure the wait under such conditions.""
Several of the first asylum-seekers returned to Mexico filed a lawsuit in February, leading to Seeborg's decision."
3022,"Trump's Policy Of Forcing Asylum-Seekers To Wait In Mexico Has Been Blocked By A Federal Judge""",BuzzFeed News,4/8/2019,,,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/trumps-policy-asylum-wait-mexico-blocked-judge,"Under the policy, certain migrants at the border receive a “notice to appear” in US immigration court and are returned to Mexico until their hearing date.
Since January, the policy has been expanded to the entire San Diego sector, including those who cross the border without authorization, along with the Calexico Port of Entry and the El Paso Port of Entry. Before handing in her resignation, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced that the policy would be expanded to other locations along the border.
""Perhaps what is most stunning about the end of 'Remain in Mexico' is the record of harsh, start-stop border policies that it joins, including family separation and the asylum ban. It’s both the chaotic implementation of these policies and this administration’s relentlessly hardline rhetoric that seem to be driving the urgency behind the current migration crisis,"" said Sarah Pierce, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.
The latest challenge was focused on a policy titled “migrant protection protocols,” the most recent attempt by the Trump administration to discourage migrants, including asylum-seekers, from trying to enter the US. The policy went into place on Jan. 28 and initially was focused on single adults at the port of entry in Tijuana.
His decision represents the latest in a string of federal court rulings blocking sweeping immigration changes instituted by the Trump administration, including the travel ban, a ban on asylum for those who crossed the border without authorization, and the repeal of DACA, among others.
""Defendants are hereby enjoined and restrained from continuing to implement or expand the 'Migrant Protection Protocols' as announced in the January 25, 2018 DHS policy memorandum and as explicated in further agency memoranda,"" Seeborg wrote .
The ruling issued by Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco states that the preliminary injunction blocking the policy will take effect on Friday at 5 p.m. PT.
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy of returning Central American migrants to Mexico while they wait for their asylum cases to be processed in the US.
The ACLU lawsuit was filed on behalf of 11 individuals seeking asylum who were taken back to Mexico. In January, the Trump administration informed the Mexican government that it was going to be enacting the policy based on a statute stating that certain individuals can be sent back to the contiguous country they had arrived from.
In its lawsuit, the ACLU claimed that the statute could not be used against asylum-seekers, and that it violates legal protections that prohibit the removal of individuals to a country where they would face persecution.
The group also argued that the administration avoided the regulatory process to institute sweeping changes and did not go through the normally deliberative system that allows for public comment before a new rule is implemented.
Seeborg wrote that ""the statute that vests DHS with authority in some circumstances to return certain aliens to a 'contiguous territory' cannot be read to apply to the individual plaintiffs or others similarly situated. Second, even assuming the statute could or should be applied to the individual plaintiffs, they have met their burden to enjoin the MPP on grounds that it lacks sufficient protections against aliens being returned to places where they face undue risk to their lives or freedom.""
The judge added that the ACLU was ""likely to show"" that the policy did not comply with the Administrative Procedures Act ""because the statute DHS contends the MPP is designed to enforce does not apply to these circumstances, and even if it did, further procedural protections would be required to conform to the government’s acknowledged obligation to ensure aliens are not returned to unduly dangerous circumstances.""
Judy Rabinovitz, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, who argued the case, said that the decision was just one more example of a rejection of the administration’s attempts to shut down asylum for migrants coming to the border.
“It’s another court saying ‘you can’t just carry out these policies in violation of the law. We are a country of law. And the laws say certain things you can do and can’t do,” she said.
One of the plaintiffs, named “Howard Doe,” was kidnapped and held by a Mexican drug cartel for two weeks on his way to the southwestern border, according to the suit. He escaped but fears that the cartel will track him down as he waits in Mexico for his immigration case to proceed. Almost none of the plaintiffs, the ACLU said, were asked about their fear of being returned to Mexico.
In Howard Doe’s case, he was referred to an asylum officer because of his stated fears of returning to Mexico but was still returned to the country without any explanation. Many of the plaintiffs have fears they will be unable to adequately communicate with legal representation in their cases, let alone have a place to sleep at night.
“Plaintiff Frank Doe does not know where he will stay while he prepares his asylum claim,” the suit read. “After being forced to return to Mexico, he attempted to return to the shelter where he resided previously, but officials turned him away because it was full. He was able to find a different shelter to stay for a couple of nights, but he does not have a more permanent residence. Plaintiff Ian Doe was also unable to return to the shelter where he stayed previously.”"

Judge Seeborg's ruling, however, is being put on hold until Friday so Trump's team has the opportunity to appeal, the Associated Press reported.
The Trump administration made the decision to force asylum seekers to wait in Mexico until their case could be heard because of the number of illegal aliens flocking to the United States-Mexico border. The various caravans traveling from Central American countries, like Guatemala and Honduras, has overwhelmed immigration officials.
The lawsuit was brought about by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Border Rights Center on behalf of various asylum seekers who argued the Trump administration wasn't assessing the danger they're facing in Mexico.
From the AP:
Under the new policy, asylum seekers are not guaranteed interpreters or lawyers and don’t get to argue to a judge that they face the potential of persecution or torture if they are sent back to Mexico, Judy Rabinovitz, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, said at a March court hearing. Seeborg appeared skeptical of the lawsuit’s argument that the administration misapplied a U.S. law that allows the return of immigrants to Mexico. The ACLU and other groups that are suing say that law does not apply to asylum seekers who cross the border illegally or arrive at a border crossing without proper documents. The judge also questioned the Justice Department’s argument that asylum seekers sent back to Mexico are not eligible for certain protections, such as a hearing before an immigration judge. The administration hopes that making asylum seekers wait in Mexico will discourage weak claims and help reduce an immigration court backlog of more than 800,000 cases.
The process was developed after talks between the United States and Mexico. The policy excludes Mexicans and children seeking asylum.
“Remain in Mexico leaves individuals and families fleeing persecution stranded on the other side of the border, when what they need and deserve under our laws is protection in America,” Archi Pyati, chief of policy for the Tahirih Justice Center, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in a statement. ""This policy goes against basic tenets of fairness, and makes it all but impossible for us to do our jobs. We are glad to see justice served.”"

In another post , the president implored congressional Democrats to join with Republican lawmakers and legislate fixes to “the horrible, costly and foolish loopholes” in U.S. immigration statutes.
“Once that happens, all will be smooth,” Trump tweeted. “We can NEVER allow Open Borders!”

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Monday directed Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan to hasten the “temporary reassignment of personnel and resources from across the agency to address the influx of migrants.” She also announced plans to require that greater numbers of non-Mexican asylum-seekers stay in Mexico while they wait for their cases to be resolved.
Trump on Thursday retreated from his earlier threat to shut down the southern border, saying he would first impose auto tariffs on Mexico in an attempt to curb the rate of illegal drugs entering the U.S.

The comments come in the wake of an escalating immigration crisis, with data suggesting Customs and Border Protection is on track to apprehend almost 1 million illegal immigrants at the border this year, and threats to close the southern border.
Trump visited the border area in California on Friday, on his way to events in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. He blamed the border situation on the current immigration system and the Democrats' opposition to his border security measures.
“There's never been so many people coming up and that's because they're gaming the system and the system is changed for the worse because of what happened with Democrats and what they've done in terms of Congress,” Trump said.

4068,"Trump threatens to close border 'next week' if Mexico doesn't 'immediately stop' flood of illegal immigrants""",Fox News (Online),3/30/2019,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-threatens-to-close-southern-border-next-week-if-mexico-doesnt-immediately-stop-illegal-immigrants-from-trying-to-cross-into-us,"President Trump on Friday threatened to close the Southern Border next week if Mexico does not “immediately stop” the record-breaking surge of illegal immigrants flooding into the United States.
Trump's warning comes as Customs and Border Protection officials say March is on pace to exceed 100,000 border apprehensions -- the highest monthly total in a decade. According to CBP, this week alone, agents have more than 12,000 migrants in custody.,
“The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, & they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S.,” Trump tweeted. “Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, & Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S. through their country and our Southern Border.”
“Mexico for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States through[sic] our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week.”
He continued: “This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and ‘talk.’ Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing!”
The president’s tweet comes after similar threats earlier in the week to close the Southern Border, with Trump accusing Mexico and Central American nations of doing “nothing” as illegal immigration surges.
Trump’s initial warning came following comments made by U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAlleenan, who said this week that the border was at its “breaking point,” noting that there are not enough agents to respond to the flow of illegal immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.
“That breaking point has arrived this week at our border,” McAleenan said during a visit to the border in El Paso, Texas. “CBP is facing an unprecedented humanitarian and border security crisis all along our Southwest border.”
His agency also tweeted that they saw the highest number of ""apprehensions and encounters"" in over a decade this week -- over 4,000 in one day: ""#CBP saw the highest total of apprehensions and encounters in over a decade on Monday, with 4,000 migrants either apprehended or encountered at ports of entry in a single day. Yesterday, that record was broken again—4,117 in a single day.""
Last month, more than 76,000 migrants were detained, marking the highest number of apprehensions in 12 years. That figure includes more than 7,000 unaccompanied children. More than 36,000 migrant families have arrived in the El Paso region in fiscal 2019 with about 2,000 at the same time last year, according to CBP data. The influx has prompted new challenges for Border Patrol agents.
And according to new data, the number of adults crossing the border illegally with children has surged. During the first four months of the year, CBP apprehended more than 136,000 migrants made up of adults and children who crossed illegally, marking a new record.
Meanwhile, the president, whose paramount 2016 campaign promise was to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, declared a national emergency in a bid to free up funding for the barrier along the border. This month, the president issued his first veto on a Democrat-backed measure to cancel the emergency.
When asked about his comments, the president said he was serious.
""Mexcio can stop them, but chose not to,"" he told reporters Friday. ""So they're going to stop them, and if they don't, we'll close the border, and we'll keep it closed for a long time.""
He added: ""I'm not playing games.""
On Tuesday, House Democrats failed to override Trump’s veto, allowing Trump to move forward with the issue.
Trump had declared the border emergency under a law that lets him shift budget funds to address dire situations. His plan is to shift an additional $3.6 billion from military construction projects to work on border barriers. Congress voted this year to limit spending on such barriers to less than $1.4 billion, and Democrats accused Trump of ignoring lawmakers' constitutional control over spending.

2520,Trump adds a deadline on his threat to close the border',CNN (Web News),3/30/2019,,,https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/29/politics/donald-trump-border-closure-again/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump on Friday repeated his threat to close down the border between the United States and Mexico, but this time he noted he would act next week if Mexico doesn't step up.
""If Mexico doesn't immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug (sic) our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week,"" he tweeted.
Trump, in Florida on Friday afternoon, said he could close the border to trade for a ""long time"" and insisted the US had run out of detention space for undocumented immigrants.
""We have the weakest, most pathetic laws,"" the President said, threatening to close the border if two current caravans of migrants cross into the US.
""We have run out of space. We can't hold people anywhere. Mexico can stop it so easily,"" he added.
Trump's comments follow a period in which the Department of Homeland Security and border officials have said their resources have become strained.
Earlier this week, Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said the ""breaking point has arrived"" for the US immigration system.
Over the last two weeks, Customs and Border Protection announced that they will be releasing migrants in Arizona, as well as the Del Rio sector and Rio Grande Valley region of Texas. And more people are expected to be apprehended at the border in March than any month since 2008, CBP says.
What does 'closing the border' mean?

So far, the plan Department of Homeland Security says it will commit to is pulling some officers from legal ports of entry to help with the influx of migrants crossing illegally. This plan will not fully close ports on the southern border as of now.
In a Friday statement announcing the move, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said there is a ""cascading crisis"" at the border and ""the system is in free fall.""
The Department of Homeland Security is moving officers from its ports to help with the mission between ports, which will result in slow downs, a senior Department of Homeland Security official told reporters.
But the official said full closure of ports of entry is ""on the table.""
""It's short at the moment of full closure of any port, we will continue to operationally assess what is needed. But I think what the President is making clear, is with these numbers, if we have to close ports to take care of all of the numbers who are coming, we will do that, so it's on the table,"" the official said. ""But what we are doing is a very structured process based on operational needs to determine how many additional personnel we can pull from other duties to address the crisis between the ports.""
The official said the Department of Homeland Security is ""looking at it from an operational perspective"" and that the Department of Homeland Security secretary will make a ""recommendation accordingly to the President.""
Can Trump legally close the southern border?
The Justice Department declined to comment on the legality of closing the border or any portion of it, as described in the President's tweet. The Justice Department also declined to comment on whether the Office of Legal Counsel has issued an opinion.
Though border closures are rare, they're not unprecedented. For example, in 1985, the abduction of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent and subsequent threats against customs agents prompted then-President Ronald Reagan, in agreement with the Mexican government, to close nine border crossings on the southern border.
Will closing the border stem the flow of migrants illegally crossing into the US?
The Department of Homeland Security official said collaboration with Mexico and shifting resources might start to stem the flow.
However, part of the crisis at hand appears to be the number of individuals and families seeking asylum in the US. Often times, asylum seekers will cross illegally into the US awaiting to be found and processed by a border agent. More personnel between ports of entry may allow more visibility to catch these migrants once they've crossed, but it's unclear whether their presence will make them more likely to avoid crossing in the first place.
It's also unclear whether the closure be limited to individuals crossing into and out of the US. If it includes cross-national trains and trucks importing and exporting goods with Latin America, a closure could pose a major threat to international commerce.
Robert Perez, deputy commissioner for Customs and Border Protection, told ""CNN's Right Now with Brianna Keilar"" on Friday that the closure of ports of entry would have ""pretty severe"" consequences.
""It's Customs and Border Protection at every port of entry. Nearly 400 million travelers a year, $2.3 billion worth of trade, nearly 30 million trucks, rail cars and cargo containers every year,"" Perez said. ""And so, there (will be) a severe impact and this is important to understand because ... what is so important to understand is that the crisis is so severe right now, we are literally trying to save lives.""
Will Trump make good on his threat?
The President seems to be hinting at news to come during a border press event in the coming weeks, at least that's what he told Fox News host Sean Hannity earlier this week.
""In two weeks, I'm going to a location, it's going to be in California. Believe it or not, they were begging us to build in San Diego, begging us to build a wall. And we're just in the process of completing a major stretch of many miles of wall. And we're going to have a news conference there just to show people that ... it's really good stuff,"" Trump said.
He also teased the visit at a rally in Michigan on Thursday.
But Trump has threatened to close the southern border prior to Friday's ultimatum, and he hasn't exactly followed through with it.
Trump tweeted in December that the US will be ""forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with."" But he didn't close the border then.
And last November, a major US-Mexico border crossing in San Diego was closed for hours after a group of hundreds of migrants on the Mexican side rushed the border area, leading US Border Patrol agents to fire tear gas at the group.
The President said at the time that ""if we find that it's uncontrollable"" or it gets to a point where ""our people are going to start getting hurt, we will close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under control.""
""The whole border. I mean the whole border,"" Trump said.
But again, he didn't make good on the threat at the time."

3865,"Southern border at 'breaking point' after more than 76,000 illegal immigrants tried crossing in February, officials say""",Fox News (Online),3/5/2019,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/more-than-76000-migrants-tried-crossing-southern-border-in-february-officials-say,"More than 76,000 people tried to cross the U.S.-Mexico border in February — a ""remarkable"" leap that more than doubles the number of border apprehensions during the same period of time last year, and is also the highest number of any February in the past 12 years, according to officials.
The system is ""well beyond capacity, and remains at the breaking point,"" U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told reporters on Tuesday as the agency released the ""record numbers"" of those trying to enter the U.S. through the southern border.
67 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FOUND IN DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS INSIDE TINY NEW MEXICO 'SHED': ICE
Officials said that 76,103 people — an increase of 31 percent over January — were apprehended. Of those, 7,249 were unaccompanied children, and 40,385 were family units -- totaling 60 percent of apprehensions.
Brian Hastings, the chief of law enforcement operations at the agency, told reporters that historically, 70 to 90 percent of apprehensions at the border included Mexican nationals.
As of Tuesday, he said, 70 percent of those arrested for attempting entry without proper documentation are from the ""Northern Triangle of Central America,"" which includes Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.
""It should be very clear from these numbers that we are facing alarming trends in the rising volumes of people illegally crossing our southwest border, or arriving at our ports of entry without documents,"" McAleenan said.
NEARLY 200 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS APPREHENDED CROSSING BORDER IN NEW MEXICO
While fewer people overall are being apprehended crossing the border illegally each year, he said the increased numbers are ""currently at our highest levels in over a decade both a border security and humanitarian crisis.""
The commissioner added that border patrol is also noticing a ""stark increase"" of those seeking asylum. Since October, there's been a 90 percent increase over the ""record levels"" of asylum seekers since the last fiscal year, according to the agency, which added that 60 percent of those trying to enter the U.S. without proper documentation are ""making claims of fear of return to their home country.""
Officials on Tuesday announced plans for a new processing center in El Paso, Texas, to manage the record number of people crossing the border. While not a permanent solution, it will be better suited to manage families and children, and handle medical care concerns.
“While our enhanced medical efforts will assist in managing the increased flows, the fact is that these solutions are temporary and this solution is not sustainable,” he said.

After two illegal immigrant children died while in Border Patrol custody, the agency stepped up medical screenings and announced sweeping changes that include more rigorous interviews as they enter into the system.
The data released on Tuesday comes as the GOP-controlled Senate plans to reject in a vote next week President Trump's national emergency declaration at the border that would send extra funding there.

3800,"Record number of families, cold reality at border'",Washington Post,3/5/2019,,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp/2019/03/04/feature/after-cold-busy-month-at-border-illegal-crossings-expected-to-surge-again/,"In a dusty lot along the U.S.-Mexico border fence, a single Border Patrol agent was stuck with few options and falling temperatures.
A group of 64 parents and children had waded through a shallow bend in the Rio Grande to turn themselves in to the agent on the U.S. side. He radioed for a van driver, but there were none available. By 2 a.m., the temperature was 44 degrees.
The agent handed out plastic space blankets. The group would have to wait.
Mothers and fathers swaddled their families in the silvery, crinkling sheets and clustered with them on the ground, shushing the children. They shivered in the cold wind, and the sound of crying carried on, like a broken alarm.
Groups like this arrived again and again in February, one of the coldest and busiest months along the southern border in years. U.S. authorities detained more than 70,000 migrants last month, according to preliminary figures, up from 58,000 in January. The majority were Central American parents with children who arrived, again, in unprecedented numbers.
During a month when the border debate was dominated by the fight over President Trump’s push for a wall, unauthorized migration in fiscal 2019 is on pace to reach its highest level in a decade. Department of Homeland Security officials say they expect the influx to swell in March and April, months that historically see large increases in illegal crossings as U.S. seasonal labor demand rises.
Migrant families wait for a Border Patrol van to take them to a holding facility in El Paso on Feb. 22. It was cold and windy that night, so a border agent distributed plastic blankets to the group.
The number of migrants taken into custody last year jumped 39 percent from February to March, and a similar increase this month would push levels to 100,000 detentions or more.
It was a surge in the border numbers in March 2018 that infuriated President Trump and launched his administration’s attempt to deter families by separating children from their parents. Trump stopped the separations six weeks later to quell public outrage. But the controversy the policy generated — and its widely publicized reversal — is now viewed by U.S. agents as the moment that opened the floodgates of family migration even wider, worsening the problem it was meant to fix.
While arrests along the border fell in recent years to their lowest levels in half a century, they are now returning to levels not seen since the George W. Bush administration, driven by the record surge in the arrival of Central American families.
For U.S. border agents, the strain has grown more acute, as they struggle to care for children using an enforcement infrastructure made in an era when the vast majority of migrants were Mexican adults who could be quickly booked and deported. The Central American families — called “give-ups” because they surrender instead of trying to sneak in — have left frustrated U.S. agents viewing their own role as little more than the facilitators for the last stage of the migrants’ journey. They are rescuing families with small children from river currents, irrigation canals, medical emergencies and freezing winter temperatures.
“We’re so cold,” said Marlen Moya, who had left Guatemala with her sons six weeks earlier and crossed the Rio Grande with the group of 64.
Moya’s son Gael, 6, was sick with a fever and moaning, his face streaked with tears. “In Juarez, we were shoved and yelled at,” she said, looking back across the river to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. “We slept on the street.”
Asked why she didn’t cross during the day, when temperatures were mild, Moya said she worried that Mexican police would stop them. “We’ve already come this far,” she said.
Marlen Moya, who had left Guatemala with her sons six weeks earlier, holds Gael, 6, as they wait along with Anderson, 8. Moya said she fled Guatemala City after being threatened and robbed at gunpoint at her beauty salon.
Much of the attention last fall was focused on caravan groups, mostly from Honduras, as they reached Tijuana, Mexico, not far from San Diego. Then concern shifted to Arizona and New Mexico, where groups of rural Guatemalan families began showing up at remote border outposts. Two Guatemalan children died in December after being taken into U.S. custody, as Homeland Security officials declared a humanitarian and national security crisis.
The border deal Trump and Democrats reached last month includes $415 million to improve detention conditions for migrant families, including funds to potentially open a new processing center in El Paso. But in the meantime, families continue to arrive in groups large and small, in faraway rural areas and right in downtown El Paso.
“The numbers are staggering, and we’re incredibly worried that we will see another huge increase in March,” said a Homeland Security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the unpublished figures.
The group by the river had landed on the no man’s land between the Rio Grande and the tall, steel American fencing. They were on U.S. soil, a place that already has a border wall.
The lone U.S. agent with the group was the only one available along that span. Drug smugglers have been using the groups as a diversion, so the agent couldn’t leave the riverbank.
No vans or buses arrived to pick up the families. Other agents were busy at the nearby processing center because so many groups had arrived in El Paso that night, and still others were at the hospital, where they were helping parents and children receive treatment for severe flu symptoms.
Homeland Security officials have been urging lawmakers to grant them broader powers to detain and quickly deport families in a search for deterrent measures. Their attempts to crack down using executive actions have been blocked repeatedly in federal court.
The migrants travel by van to a holding facility in El Paso.
The Trump administration has begun sending some asylum-seeking Central Americans back to Mexico to wait while their claims are processed, but so far that experiment has been limited to California’s San Ysidro port of entry.
About 150 migrants were sent back across the border in February, according to Mexican authorities, but that is a small fraction of the more than 2,000 unauthorized migrants coming into U.S. custody on an average day.
Homeland Security officials said Friday that the pilot program, which they call Migrant Protection Protocols, will expand to El Paso and potentially other locations in coming weeks, predicting that the number of Central Americans sent back would grow “exponentially.” Some of the cities where they will wait are among the most dangerous in Mexico.
Mexican officials are cooperating by providing general assistance and job placement for those sent back to wait, but privately they have warned the Americans that their capacity to take parents with children is extremely limited, especially families that need welfare assistance and enrollment in already-crowded public schools.
Migrants at the border hold tight to the blankets and move about the area to stay warm while they wait for the van.
Arrivals and departures
U.S. court restrictions on the government’s ability to keep children in immigration jails — and the sheer volume of people arriving — have left Homeland Security agencies defaulting increasingly to the overflow model Trump deplores as “catch-and-release.”
Volunteer workers from religious charities were visible at the El Paso airport last month, guiding newly arrived Central American families through the terminal, directing them like a tour group.
The adults wore GPS monitors on their ankles and carried manila envelopes with instructions telling them when to appear in court for their asylum claims. Some were traveling in premium seats, the only last-minute tickets available when their families arranged the flights.
It was the first time many of the migrants had been on an airplane. For Dionel Martinez, it was the second.
The 48-year-old Guatemalan came to the United States three decades earlier, working as a landscaper until he was deported — his only other time on a plane.
“We’re going to Pennsylvania,” he said. A friend had arranged a job at a pizzeria there.
With the savings from his first stint in the United States as a young man, Martinez was able to buy some land in his home country and start a family. But a drought this year had left them hungry.
“There was no harvest,” he said. “Not one grain of corn.”
His son Darwin, 13, came with him to the United States this time. The boy fainted during the journey, his father said, when they had to stand for hours in the back of a cattle truck.
Martinez said he paid 30,000 Guatemalan quetzals, about $2,500, to a “coyote” smuggling guide. It was a cheap rate, but it meant that he and his son traveled through Mexico in trucks, like cargo.
Across rural Guatemala, Martinez said, word has spread that those who travel with a child can expect to be released from U.S. custody. Smugglers were offering two-for-one pricing, knowing they just needed to deliver clients to the border — not across it — for an easy surrender to U.S. agents.
The group of 64 migrants came across the Rio Grande and presented themselves to U.S. authorities. Migrant families keep walking to stay warm as they wait for the van in El Paso. The group of 64 includes parents and children hoping to remain in the United States.
Migrant families keep walking to stay warm as they wait for the van in El Paso. The group of 64 migrants came across the Rio Grande and presented themselves to U.S. authorities.
“If this continues, I don’t think there will be anyone left in Guatemala,” Martinez joked. The men from his village near the town of Chiquimula were all leaving, he said, bringing a child with them.
Martinez said he used the family home as collateral. He had four months to pay off the $2,500. “I need a way to feed my family, and this is it,” he said.
Not all Central American families are economic migrants. Others, especially from Honduras, arrive with stories of gang threats and violent attacks. After crossing the border, a U.S. asylum officer performs a preliminary screening to determine whether their fears of persecution are credible enough to deserve a hearing with an immigration judge.
The problem, Homeland Security officials say, is that a growing portion of those who pass the initial screening never appear in court. They know asylum standards are tightening. Or, like Martinez, they have a prior deportation from the United States that all but disqualifies them from getting asylum.
Once released into the U.S. interior, some shed their monitoring bracelets and slip into the shadows to remain in the United States, a country where wages are 10 times higher than in Central America.
The saturation at the border means that it matters little whether a parent’s story of persecution is sufficiently credible; the United States has just three detention facilities appropriate for families, with about 3,000 beds, and those are full. The pipeline backs up into Border Patrol stations that were never designed for long-term detention, let alone children, many of whom arrive sick after days in cramped quarters.
A Border Patrol agent in Antelope Wells, N.M., uses his truck as a perch to spot smugglers and groups of migrants approaching the border.
A crossing gone quiet
The tiny, remote Antelope Wells, N.M., border crossing, where 8-year-old Jakelin Caal arrived in December before falling fatally ill, is now staffed with a team of medically trained Border Patrol agents. But that crossing has gone quiet in recent weeks, as more large groups turn up on El Paso’s riverbanks.
For families too poor to hire a smuggler, it was the only place to cross, converging with others who sought safety in numbers. Carlos Guevara, 35, said he and his son had wandered the streets of Juarez with nowhere to sleep, then spotted the crowd heading for the river.
“I want to give my son a better life,” he said. Guevara said he earned about $6 a day for farm labor in Honduras, and left a month earlier with, Carlitos, 7, en route to Michigan. “I can’t stand being poor anymore.”
Swathed in plastic, his son approached the headlights of an agent’s Border Patrol truck, its idling engine offering some warmth. Other children in the group were still crying and calling out.
Ramiro Cordero, a Border Patrol official assigned to accompany reporters, called on the radio, and said he would go back to the nearest station and get a van himself.
Border Patrol official Ramiro Cordero puts bracelets on Mairon Argueta and his daughter Elsi Argueta, 4, who arrived in El Paso from Honduras. The bracelets identify the group of migrants and how many people crossed.
“This is what’s happening on a daily basis,” Cordero said. “You’ve got to understand that we have to take care of everyone that comes across. And this requires transportation and a lot of logistical support.”
“Hopefully the vans can get here to transport them to one of the processing facilities,” he said. “But for right now, this is where we stay.”
He lined up the parents and children to issue bracelets to each one with a number corresponding to their arrival group. “They will be provided with basic needs, whether it’s water, juices, warm meals,” Cordero said. They would also get a medical screening.
Two blue-uniformed customs officers, summoned to help the Border Patrol agents, arrived with a van after 3 a.m.
The agents loaded the families into the vehicle, needing three trips to transport the entire group. The crying had stopped. On the radio, a dispatcher said there were already 607 migrants in custody at the processing center where they were headed, more than twice its capacity."

2860,Courts Should Not Defer to Trump\xe2\x80\x99s National-Security Pretext',National Review,2/15/2019,,,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/trump-border-wall-national-security-pretext-courts-should-not-defer/,"President Trump talks with a Border Patrol agent while touring border wall prototypes near the Otay Mesa Port of Entry in San Diego, Calif., March 13, 2018. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)
Earlier today, Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced that President Trump will sign the compromise government funding bill and “will also take other executive action — including a national emergency — to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border.” These are ominous words, indicating that the president is prepared to defy Congress and the plain language of the relevant statutes in a blatant abuse of power. Moreover, because he’s apparently set to invoke “national security,” the stakes are particularly high. Here’s why.
Advertisement
Traditionally, the Supreme Court has granted the president an immense amount of deference on matters of national security. While that deference isn’t unlimited (see Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer), as a general matter, courts are reluctant to intervene when the president invokes his powers as commander-in-chief, preferring to leave key national security determinations to the political branches. But if the courts defer here, they’ll set a dangerous precedent. They’ll permit the president to override a comprehensive civilian statutory border-protection scheme in the absence of any armed conflict or event the reasonable prospect of any armed conflict on the southern border.
The border-security mission with an allied nation is a civilian mission. The border wall is a civilian structure that will be manned by civilian government employees. The border-security scheme is set by congressional statute (and is set to be modestly supplemented by the very compromise funding bill that Trump is about to defy). The wall is not a military fortification. Moreover, crime prevention and the enforcement of criminal laws is also fundamentally a civilian mission. The president waving his hands and citing “national security” doesn’t change any of these facts.

If the Supreme Court wants to maintain deference in the case of war or the prospect of war, it can still check Trump without doing any damage to the commander-in-chief’s constitutional military authority. There can and should be one degree of deference in the presence or prospect of an armed conflict under international law and lesser deference in the absence of an armed conflict or the prospect of an armed conflict. Otherwise “national security” simply means whatever the president says it means, and it can be invoked at will to enable a host of abuses.
It has become plain that we cannot trust presidents to police their own use of power. They will press to the very limits, trusting partisan allies in the House or Senate to limit any congressional response. That’s the story of DACA and DAPA, and Trump hopes that’s the story of his national-emergency declaration. But the judicial power of the Article III courts encompasses the ability to interpret statutes enacted by Congress, and courts abdicate their constitutional role if they delegate to the chief executive the interpretation of the national-security statutes that he seeks to enforce.

2651,What is a national emergency? Can Trump declare one for the wall?',Al Jazeera,2/15/2019,,,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/national-emergency-trump-declare-wall-190214225808895.html,"US President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency in a bid to fund his promised wall at the US-Mexico border without congressional approval, an action Democrats vowed to challenge as a violation of the US Constitution.
The Republican president's move to circumvent Congress represented a new approach to making good on a 2016 presidential campaign pledge to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants into the country.
Trump began weighing whether to declare a national emergency after Democrats refused to cave to his demand for $5.7bn in funding for the wall, prompting a 35-day government shutdown - the longest in US history.
That shutdown ended last month after Trump, his fellow Republicans, and Democrats came to an agreement to open the government for three weeks while talks continued on border security.
Facing a Friday deadline, congressional leaders came to an agreement earlier this week aimed at keeping the government open. Although it includes $1.37bn in funding to help build physical barriers on the border, it does not include money for concrete walls, forcing Trump to look elsewhere for funding.
190214201620950
Here's a look at what a national emergency is, and why Democrats and many experts say Trump does not have the legal authority to declare one in this context.
What is a national emergency? What will happen once it's declared?
US federal law gives a number of powers to the president to use in response to a ""crisis, exigency, or emergency circumstances threatening the nation"", a document prepared for Congress states. He can do so at will.
Declaring a national emergency allows the president to meet the problems of ""governing effectively"" in times of crisis. They also allow the president to ""seize property, organise and control the means of production, seize commodities, assign military forces abroad, institute martial law, seize and control all transportation and communication, regulate the operation of private enterprise, restrict travel, and, in a variety of ways, control the lives of United States citizens,"" the document states.
Declaring a national emergency is a rare step. In this case, it would allow Trump to redirect federal funds from elsewhere to pay for his border wall.
190214201620950
Jessica Levinson, political law professor at Loyola Law School, said although Trump had the power to declare an emergency at any moment, it would be a complicated process.
""He has to say 'here's an emergency and here's what I need',"" she told Al Jazeera.
""I need more money, I need more people, etc,"" she added. ""But the question is then if he waited so long to do this, and the country went through a government shutdown over this, how is it an emergency now? Where is the urgency?""
It's also unclear where Trump can get the funding because Congress would still need to earmark money for the wall. However, some legal experts have told local media that Trump may be able to turn to unallocated funds in the Department of Defense's budget.
A source told Reuters that the White House lawyers had vetted the figures and believed they would withstand a legal challenge.
Levinson said to expect a legal battle once Trump declares a national emergency.
""At that point, people will sue and say this is not an emergency,"" she said.
Fifteen Democrats in the Republican-controlled Senate introduced legislation prior to Trump's declaration to prevent Trump from invoking emergency powers to transfer funds to his wall from accounts Congress has already committed to other projects.
New York state's attorney general, Letitia James, said her office would also challenge Trump in court.
Under the Constitution, Congress holds the national purse strings and makes major decisions on spending taxpayer money.
Disputes over the constitutionality or legality of the exercise of emergency powers are judicially reviewable, the document prepared for Congress states.
What does Trump say?
Trump, who campaigned on a promise to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, had demanded Congress allocate $5.7bn in funding for the wall.
181210211443443
But Democrats, who recently took control of the House of Representatives, refused, calling the wall ineffective, expensive and immoral.
The legislation hammered out by Congress this week does not include money for a concrete wall, but it does allocate $1.37bn in funding for physical barriers.
But Trump hopes by ordering the national emergency he can still follow through on his campaign promise.
Trump estimated his emergency declaration could free up as much as $8bn to pay for part of the wall. Estimates of its total cost run as high as $23bn.
The president acknowledged that his order would face a lengthy court fight.
""I expect to be sued. I shouldn't be sued ... We'll win in the Supreme Court,"" Trump predicted as he announced the national emergency.
On Monday, as congressional leaders announced a compromise that didn't include wall funding, Trump declared in front of a rally of supporters that he was going to get the wall built one way or the other.
""Just so you know - we're building the wall anyway,"" Trump said.
The president maintains that the wall is necessary to stem irregular immigration and drug trafficking.
But statistics show that irregular immigration has dropped to a 20-year low and that many drug shipments are likely smuggled through official ports of entry, leading critics to argue a wall is not needed.
Confronted with those statistics at a Rose Garden event with reporters, Trump said they were ""wrong"".
What do Democrats say?
Democrats have long resisted Trump's call for a wall and said the president had fabricated a ""crisis"" at the border to justify an unconstitutional grab for funding.
Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer swiftly responded to Trump's declaration.
""The president's actions clearly violate the Congress’s exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution,"" they said in a statement.
""The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the courts, and in the public, using every remedy available,” they added.
On Thursday, Pelosi said there was no crisis at the border with Mexico that requires a national emergency order.
190104163142319
""If the president can declare an emergency on something that he has created as an emergency - an illusion that he wants to convey - just think of what a president with different values can present to the American people,"" Pelosi added, pointing to gun violence in the United States as a national emergency.
She said Democrats were prepared to respond appropriately to a declaration of national emergency.
What do Americans say?
The majority of Americans continue to oppose expanding the border wall.
Of 1,505 adults surveyed last month in a Pew Research Center poll, 58 percent said they opposed substantial wall expansions while 40 percent said favoured wall expansions.
Partisan differences are widening as Republican support for the wall is at a record high at 82 percent, an increase of 10 percent from last year, while Democratic support has reached a new low at 6 percent, down from 13 percent last year.
Although opinion over wall expansions have not seen a substantial change from last year, they have never been more sharply divided along partisan lines."
5279,4 winners and 4 losers from the funding bill and emergency declaration',Vox,2/15/2019,,,https://www.vox.com/2019/2/15/18224715/trump-emergency-national-news-border-wall,"The long-term effects of President Donald Trump’s decision to declare a national emergency Friday — unlocking an additional $7.5 billion to build physical barriers (a “wall”) on the US-Mexico border, in addition to the $1.375 billion appropriated by Congress in the bill Trump signed to fund the government through September 30 — won’t be fully known or understood until the historians get to them.
The emergency declaration itself could be held up in court for months or years. The construction of barriers it authorizes, if allowed to go forward, could take years more. The influence it has (or lack thereof) on norms of executive authority, and the precedent it may or may not set for future political actions, will be the subject of endless debate.
But what happened Friday morning wasn’t just the start of some new and uneasy moment. It was the culmination of a months-long funding battle that resulted in the longest (partial) government shutdown in history. Trump just signed a bill that sets funding levels (and keeps the government open) for the next six months, in addition to making some policy changes around the edges. And the emergency declaration alters political dynamics in Washington that are going to have an impact on what change various politicians can make in the future.
The “winners” and “losers” here are the real effects on people’s lives; even the rising or falling stock of a given politician matters for the policy and institutional agendas he seeks to advance. Even if Trump’s declaration of national emergency opens a whole set of new fights, there are people whose fortunes are definitely better or worse after this morning.
Winner: federal employees
Thanks to Donald Trump’s uncanny ability to make it all about him, the national emergency declaration is getting most of the attention right now. But it’s important not to lose sight of the fact that Congress just passed (and the president just signed) a bill to fund nine Cabinet departments and a host of federal agencies through the end of the fiscal year on September 30. And unlike the emergency declaration — which even the Department of Justice anticipates will almost certainly be slowed by the courts — the funding bill is actually going into effect.
In other words, the United States has just ensured that we won’t have another government shutdown for at least six and a half months.
That might not seem like much of a respite. But it’s the longest respite the federal government — and federal employees — have had since Trump came into office.
It’s not just that there have been three shutdowns over the past two years (though two of them happened over weekends and thus barely affected federal employees), or that the shutdown that ended three weeks ago was the longest in history. It’s that when the government has been open, it’s often been running on short-term continuing resolutions. Over Trump’s time in office, a normal budgeting process would have had the government face two funding deadlines, when the fiscal years ended for 2017 and 2018; instead, it’s faced 12. And many of those have gone down to the wire.
Many federal employees will be dealing with the financial aftermath of January’s shutdown (and their delayed paychecks) for some time. But the uncertainty of governance-by-continuing-resolution has its own costs to federal employees’ budgets and psyches. Six and a half months is, relatively speaking, a high degree of certainty.
Furthermore, it’s possible that Trump’s breaking the seal on the national emergency might reduce the risk of future government funding brinksmanship. The president has been threatening to shut down the government over the wall since spring 2017; he finally did it, it didn’t work, and now he’s trying something else. It’s possible that if he no longer sees threatening shutdown as the best way to get what he wants, the next two years might give federal employees more than a few weeks at a time before they have to worry about when they’re getting their next paycheck.
And the cherry on top: Defying Trump’s effort to freeze federal salaries, Congress authorized a 1.8 percent pay raise in the funding bill for civilian feds.
Loser: the “power of the purse”
It’s a staple of fifth-grade civics units: The federal government is made of three co-equal branches kept in equilibrium by a system of “checks and balances,” and one of the most important checks that the legislative branch has on the executive — arguably Congress’s most important power, period — is the “power of the purse.”
Congress appropriates money to the executive branch, and Congress determines how that money gets spent. The executive branch might be legally obligated to submit a budget, but the legislative branch has no legal obligation to pay attention to it.
In practice, the executive branch has some options when it wants to move money around. And Congress has passed laws that give the executive branch even more powers in the case of a national emergency — though an emergency declaration unlocks a long list of specific powers, not a blank check to do whatever the president wants.
But even if Trump’s national emergency declaration is a valid exercise of the National Emergencies Act of 1976 — and it will be up to the courts to figure that out — the fact remains: The president of the United States demanded that Congress fund a policy priority of his, Congress refused to fund it at the levels demanded, and the president responded by directing billions more dollars to it anyway.
What really distinguishes this emergency declaration from others isn’t necessarily the factual question of what counts as a national emergency. It’s the fact that Trump telegraphed what he was going to do for weeks — while Congress was negotiating with him and with itself over government funding. Trump was absent from the negotiations that produced this funding bill. He’d already made it clear that if he didn’t get what he wanted from Congress, he’d simply get it another way.
Of course, Trump’s obviousness is going to make it that much harder for the Department of Justice to defend the emergency declaration from the inevitable lawsuits. But that’s the story of the federal government over the past decade or so: The executive branch makes policy, and the judicial branch decides whether to uphold it. The legislative branch is left giving vaguely disapproving quotes to the press.
Loser: Mitch McConnell
Mitch McConnell finally tried to stand up to Donald Trump, and Trump made him back down.
The Senate majority leader’s approach to the mercurial president has been to let Trump decide what he wants and then put varying levels of legislative elbow grease into making that happen. It’s a smart approach, if the goal is to protect your incumbent Republican senators: It avoids the worst-case scenario in which senators take a tough vote on a bill because they think the president will sign it, only to have Trump reject the bill and whip up the base against its supporters. Of course, when the president doesn’t say what he wants — or isn’t willing to modify his demands into something that can actually pass — you risk government shutdowns.
McConnell cares more about preventing shutdown than Trump does. So after the government reopened in January, he let his appropriators (led by Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby) actually make a deal first and get the president’s approval later.
At the same time, though, McConnell let it be known that he didn’t want Trump to declare a national emergency. (The Washington Post headline was “McConnell privately cautions Trump about emergency declaration on border wall,” but someone had to tell the Post about the “private” cautioning.) It was an effort to preserve some legislative power vis-à-vis the president — not least in case the Senate was still in Republican hands the next time the presidency was in Democratic ones.
But McConnell couldn’t prevent both a shutdown and an emergency. Before Republican senators were willing to vote for the deal Thursday, they needed assurance the president would actually sign it. And the president’s assurance, apparently, only came when he decided to sign the emergency declaration at the same time.
The result is that McConnell, who let it be known he didn’t want a national emergency, had to stand on the Senate floor and say he supported the president’s decision to sign one to keep the government open. Worse, if the House successfully passes a resolution attempting to reverse the declaration, it will go straight to the Senate floor — McConnell has no power to block it. McConnell will have to either risk embarrassing Republican defections that could kill an emergency declaration he himself is now on the record supporting or whip Republican votes to save an emergency declaration he didn’t want.
Trump’s method of “negotiating” — find various ways to get what you want and wear the other guy down instead of compromising — hasn’t usually worked in Washington. It just worked on, of all people, Mitch McConnell.
Winner: 2020 Democrats
As Democratic politicians have started declaring their candidacies for the 2020 presidential primary and sketching out their policy proposals, they’re inevitably hit with two questions: “How are you going to pay for it?” and “How is that going to get 60 votes in the Senate and survive a filibuster?”
Trump just gave them an easy way to answer both questions at once: declare a national emergency.
Democrats are already threatening to use emergency powers in future to pass their own preferred policies to address the things they think are crises. They’re not digging into the specific emergency authorities they would use, and in some cases, there probably aren’t any available — unlocking emergency funds doesn’t necessarily give you a way to expand gun regulation, for example. But presidential candidates don’t tend to get punished by the voters for overstating the scope of their potential powers.
Almost as importantly, Trump’s emergency declaration distracts political attention from what could have been the first big intra-Democratic fight of the primary. The funding bill Congress passed Thursday was attacked by progressives in the immigrant rights movement for its expansion of immigration detention and what they perceived as insufficient checks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Several presidential candidates — including Sens. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) — voted against it. Others — including Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and the still-undeclared-but-likely candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) — voted for.
Under normal circumstances, those on each side of the bill would now be dogged by questions about their votes — and invited to attack candidates who disagreed. But now, there’s something else for reporters to ask about: an emergency declaration that every Democrat will agree is unnecessary and destructive.
Winner: immigration detention
The Trump administration has played hardball on immigration detention with Congress, and it appears to be paying off.
The bill gives ICE money to keep an average of 45,274 immigrants in detention between now and September 30. That’s more, by far, than Congress has ever funded ICE for in advance before. It is, however, less than the number of people actually in detention right now — more than 49,000 as of the beginning of this week.
In theory, then, ICE is going to have to release some immigrants from detention, or choose not to detain new ones after they’re arrested. Democrats hope that by the end of September, ICE will have the detained population down to 40,520 or so — the level that Congress authorized in its 2018 funding package but that ICE vastly exceeded.
But there’s no way to force ICE to stick to its budget this time either. The Trump administration retains its authority to move some money from other things into ICE detention.
The bill includes money for “alternatives to detention,” and restarts a case management program for asylum-seeking families that immigrant rights advocates have long championed as a better approach. But the Trump administration is deeply skeptical of anything that could allow asylum seekers to “abscond” and miss their court dates. Furthermore, the administration is adamant that it needs to detain every immigrant with a criminal conviction or charge in order to protect the safety of the American people, and those make up a majority of the immigrants ICE arrests (as opposed to those apprehended coming into the US).
It’s very possible the administration will continue its tactic of detaining people first and finding the money (or asking Congress for help) later.
Loser: “Build the wall”
Seriously, hear me out.
Yes, Trump has as much as $9 billion to build barriers on the US-Mexico border as a result of this morning’s actions (though how much of that money is ultimately available to him will depend on the outcome of the inevitable national emergency lawsuit). But the months-long fight over funding has demonstrated conclusively that no one can actually agree on what counts as a wall — including the president and the conservative media elites who have occasionally threatened to stir up the base against him.
Without a consensus about what the “wall” is, the fight over it can never get resolved. Trump can declare victory — or Democrats, thwarting him, can declare his defeat on his behalf — but it won’t necessarily stick. When both sides can declare victory, the fight just goes on for another round.
Democrats in Congress crowed that the $1.375 billion they appropriated in this funding bill wasn’t money for a “wall,” because they only authorized that money to be used for “fencing” that conformed to designs already in place on the US-Mexico border. But that’s exactly what the administration was asking for to begin with.
Even before the government shutdown, the Department of Homeland Security said it would use the $5.7 billion Trump was demanding to build steel bollard fencing, the same thing Congress has funded. The Trump administration says it’s now using the emergency declaration money to complete those same projects — and it’s explicitly said it’s using bollards. So the “wall” Trump is building with the emergency declaration is going to be identical to the “not a wall” Congress authorized.
Without agreement on whether Trump is currently building the wall or not, how can Trump declare he’s completed it? How can Democrats declare he’s funded it?
President Trump recognizes the pickle he’s in. He turned “build the wall” into a political slogan among people who didn’t understand the border security status quo or what would actually be workable. Now he’s trying to get his base to pivot to “finish the wall” as a way of squaring the circle — and they’re not buying it. There will be future fights over “wall” funding, and they will probably get hopelessly buried in semantics. Because the idea of the “wall” as an entity that people could agree on, and decide to fund or not, is dead.
Winner: congressional oversight
The power of the legislative branch may have taken a big hit Friday, but there is a silver lining for Congress — or at least House Democrats. The funding bill shows that Democrats are serious about providing oversight of the administration — and it demonstrates how robust oversight can change policy.
The bill includes robust reporting requirements for ICE and CBP — on the number of immigrants in detention, any ongoing separation of families at the border (and updates on continued questions about how many families were separated in 2017 and early 2018), and how exactly CBP plans to spend the money it’s authorized for construction and infrastructure. It also instructs the inspector general to continue spot checks of immigration detention centers, while barring ICE and CBP from preventing any member of Congress from entering a facility to inspect it.
Ideally, oversight isn’t just a way to name and shame the executive branch for doing things the opposition finds unconscionable. In theory, it can occasionally lead to actual changes in policy, law, or funding. There’s some of that in the bill too.
In the past, Democrats in Congress have shown particular interest in the treatment of pregnant women in immigration detention; there’s a very strict ban in the bill on the shackling of any pregnant woman in the custody of immigration agents.
Last year, questions from Congress (and follow-up reporting) revealed that ICE arrested some unauthorized immigrants who had agreed to sponsor children who had come to the US unaccompanied. This bill bars ICE from spending any appropriated money on enforcement against sponsors of unaccompanied children.
Oversight doesn’t have to be antagonistic — it can be a way for members of Congress to understand why the administration wants what it wants.
The bill doesn’t give the administration the $800 million in “humanitarian” funding it asked for to improve treatment of children and families — something some congressional Democrats have professed concern about after the deaths of two children in CBP custody in December — but it does give $415 million. About half of that money would be used to build a new processing center for families in Texas, as an alternative to holding families in places that aren’t designed to hold immigrants at all; the rest would be used to hire medical contractors, provide better food and more diapers, and increase CBP’s capacity to move immigrants to a suitable facility even if they’re apprehended in a remote location.
Some progressives are deeply upset with the bill for its expansion of immigrant detention; some progressive first-term members (led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) had insisted that ICE and CBP have their budgets reduced, not expanded. But there are more restrictions on how that money can be spent, and what the administration has to do to keep Congress from reducing it next time out of pique or distrust, than there would be if Republicans were in charge.
Loser: federal contractors
Federal employees are getting back pay for their work during the partial government shutdown. But as many as 580,000 federal contractors — from security guards and janitors to researchers and IT workers — aren’t getting their lost wages back.
Democrats, led by Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith, had wanted to add a bill to the final spending package that would have guaranteed contractors wages they had missed out on because of the impasse. They were blocked, however, by Senate Republicans and the White House.
One Trump administration official told HuffPost that implementing a process to dole out back pay could wind up being costly for federal agencies. But a representative from the Professional Services Council, a group that advocates on behalf of contractors, told the Hill he didn’t think that was actually the case.
Because of the disagreement among negotiators and the tight timeline on completing this spending deal, federal contractors have once again been left out in the cold. Many contractors said they had struggled to cover day-to-day living costs during the shutdown, including medication, baby formula, and child care.
Smith has said she’ll keep pushing for contractors to receive the compensation they need. But for now — if Trump signs this spending agreement — all they have is the reassurance that the federal government won’t shut down again for at least six more months. —Li Zhou"
4945,"Trump's emergency declaration would trigger a drawn out legal fight""",USA TODAY,2/14/2019,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/14/donald-trump-emergency-border-wall-long-legal-fight/2548526002/,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump will declare a national emergency to speed up funding for his proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexican border, but experts said the move would create a legal morass that could take until the middle of next year to resolve.
The White House announced Thursday that Trump will make the move that he'd suggested for weeks. The announcement came as Congress readied legislation that would devote $1.375 billion to the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump demanded.
Declaring an emergency would let Trump sidestep Democratic opposition to more wall funding, but it could draw legal challenges from lawmakers and others who viewed the move as a power grab. Although that could delay construction of his border barriers, an extended legal battle would give Trump a potent political issue to run on in the 2020 presidential election.
""Everyone’s going to come out of the woodwork,"" said Stephen Vladeck, a University of Texas-Austin law professor who teaches national security law. ""I think we’re going to see an array of lawsuits that actually would all have to be dealt with separately.""
More:How congressional Democrats could fight a Trump wall emergency declaration
More:What to know about national emergencies and their role in US history
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the administration is ""very prepared"" for legal challenges.
The potential for an extended legal battle may explain why Trump backed away from the emergency scenario last month. The president, who faced criticism from some Republicans for the idea, said he wouldn't declare an emergency imminently. Republicans noted a future Democratic president could also use an emergency to work around Congress.
Litigation could go all the way to the Supreme Court, which has smacked down attempts by both Trump and President Barack Obama to make end runs around Congress. How long that takes would depend on several factors:
• Which programs the White House might try to tap for funding.
• Whether Trump tries to speed the seizure of property from unwilling owners.
• Who could be harmed by the order and would have the right to sue.
• What court or courts are chosen by challengers seeking favorable verdicts.
For weeks, Trump weighed invoking a national emergency as the political impasse over the wall led to a partial government shutdown that became the longest in U.S. history. White House aides acknowledged that lawyers reviewed the ramifications.
The president expressed confidence in the legal strategy. ""The law is 100 percent on my side,"" he said.
Democrats blasted the move. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer called the decision a ""gross abuse of the power of the presidency"" in a joint statement.
Legal experts differed over how much latitude Trump would have to free up money for the wall on his own. They cautioned that those who favor an emergency declaration may trade a deadlock in Congress for a lengthy legal fight in the federal judiciary.
Walter Dellinger, an assistant attorney general and head of the Office of Legal Counsel under President Bill Clinton, said a lawsuit could reach the Supreme Court in a matter of months but probably would not be resolved quickly.
“I think that a clear majority of the Supreme Court will be deeply troubled by the invocation of emergency authority in this case,” Dellinger said. ""In the normal course, we might not expect a decision until June of 2020 at the earliest.""
Presidents have broad authority to declare an emergency but are more restricted in how they can use it. White House officials zeroed in on provisions that would let Trump capture unused money Congress set aside for other purposes.
“None of these statutes is a blank check,"" Vladeck said.
Another question that would have to be decided early in the process: Who has the right to sue? Lawmakers might sue by arguing the president usurped their power through an emergency declaration. Homeowners on the border whose property could be seized to build the wall also might have a case, experts said.
Litigation may turn in part on whether Trump erred in declaring an emergency in the first place. Though the president described the situation on the border as a ""security and humanitarian crisis,"" the number of people apprehended attempting to cross the border illegally has fallen considerably over the past decade.
Courts have traditionally given presidents leeway to decide matters of national security.
""There’s just not a lot of guidance in these statutes about what actually constitutes a national emergency,"" said Margaret Taylor, senior editor and counsel at the legal blog Lawfare and a former Democratic aide on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""Congress and the courts have been deferential to presidents on that decision.""
On the other hand, presidents have faced successful challenges after they took action to sidestep Congress. Obama's effort to shield from deportation about 5 million undocumented immigrants through an executive order faced a high-profile lawsuit from Texas that dragged on for months before the Supreme Court killed the program.
Challengers presumably would bring their lawsuits to district court judges they considered likely to look askance at Trump’s action – a practice known as “forum shopping” that’s used by both liberals and conservatives to improve their chances. Liberals often file cases within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, based in California; conservatives often opt for the 5th Circuit, which includes Texas.
Signaling that he may have learned from the extended legal challenge that for months blocked his travel ban on predominately Muslim countries, Trump predicted opponents might try to bring a challenge to an emergency declaration in the 9th Circuit.
""What will happen? I'll be sued. It'll be brought to the 9th Circuit. We'll probably lose there, too,"" Trump said. ""And then hopefully we'll win in the Supreme Court."""

Lawmakers in both parties sharply criticized President Donald Trump on Thursday for planning to declare a national emergency to build his long-promised border wall.
""Declaring a national emergency would be a lawless act, a gross abuse of the power of the presidency and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that President Trump broke his core promise to have Mexico pay for his wall,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump would sign a congressional deal to avoid a shutdown Friday but will also declare a national emergency ""to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border.""
The potential emergency declaration, which Trump could try to use to obtain existing government funds from agencies and departments to build the wall without congressional approval, set off a chorus of criticism from Democrats and Republicans.

A number of Republicans also said they would oppose any emergency declaration, arguing that it sets a precedent for a future Democratic administration and amounts to presidential overreach.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., criticized the administration for the idea of issuing a national declaration, as well as Congress voting on a voluminous bill with little time for consideration.
""I, too, want stronger border security, including a wall in some areas. But how we do things matters. Over 1,000 pages dropped in the middle of the night and extraconstitutional executive actions are wrong, no matter which party does them,"" Paul said in a tweet.
""I’m disappointed with both the massive, bloated, secretive bill that just passed and with the president's intention to declare an emergency to build a wall,"" he added.
Other Republican lawmakers echoed Paul's concerns, worried that such a move by Trump would embolden a future Democratic president to tackle controversial issues such as gun violence.
""I do not support this decision because declaring a national emergency sets a very dangerous precedent that undermines our constitutional separation of powers. By circumventing Congress and Article I of the Constitution, President Trump is opening the door for any future president to act alone without congressional approval,"" Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wa., said in a statement.
""If elected president, how would Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders use this precedent for a national disaster declaration to force the Green New Deal on the American people?""
Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, concluded, ""Whether the president has the authority or not, it sets a dangerous precedent and places America on a path that we will regret."""
4998,Trump intends to sign border deal to avoid another shutdown',CNN (Web News),2/13/2019,,,https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/13/politics/trump-border-security-deal/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump intends to sign the border security deal to avoid another partial government shutdown, according to two sources who have spoken directly with the President.
Trump said Tuesday that he was ""not happy"" with the tentative deal reached by congressional negotiators late Monday night that falls far short of his original demands.
On Wednesday, he told reporters he would ""take a very serious look"" at the legislation, adding that he does not want the government to shut down again.
Congress faces a deadline to get a deal passed and signed by Trump before Friday.

6145,Trump Is Expected to Sign Border-Security Deal',Wall Street Journal - News,2/13/2019,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-is-expected-to-sign-border-security-deal-11550064070,"WASHINGTON—President Trump is likely to sign the border-security legislation finalized Wednesday that would keep the government from closing this weekend, people familiar with his plans said, but he continues to look for ways to supplement the modest funding it contains for barriers.
Mr. Trump said he would take a serious look at the legislation, which includes far less money for barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border than he has demanded, but gave no assurance he would sign it. He said he doesn’t want to see another government..."
2108,"Trump says he has other 'options' for paying for border wall""",Washington Times,2/13/2019,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/feb/13/donald-trump-likely-sign-border-deal-avoid-governm/,"President Trump says he made his point — the U.S. needs a border wall, and he will build it with or without Congress.
Rather than force another unpopular and economically harmful government shutdown, Mr. Trump sounds increasingly willing to accept the agreement in Congress that provides about $1.3 billion for border barriers. That’s less than one-fourth of the $5.7 billion that he demanded initially for a wall.
“I think a point was made with the last shutdown,” the president said Wednesday. “People realized how bad the border is, how unsafe the border is.”
Lawmakers sorted out the details of the agreement and released details of the bill early Thursday morning. The House and Senate will be voting on the bill later in the day.
The nearly 1,800-page spending bill has money for 55 miles of new border “fencing” in Texas, and money to maintain a daily average of 45,274 detention beds under Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, the agency that now holds more than 49,000 immigrants who live in the U.S. illegally in custody. The bill also provides the authority to move cash around to go above that level, if the Homeland Secretary determines it’s needed.
When that question and others were still unresolved late Wednesday, the conservative House Freedom Caucus called for a one-week extension of stopgap funding to keep the government open and give lawmakers more time to review the fine print of the border deal. Congress is facing a Friday deadline to approve spending bills to keep nine government agencies open.
The agreement would pay for 55 miles of border fencing or barriers, but not concrete walls, in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. The president and his advisers are exploring other ways to shift money within departments to pay for more barriers, an option that is riling up congressional Democrats.
“He needs congressional permission to do it,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, who noted that Democrats now hold the House majority. “He doesn’t have the authority to do it without House permission.”
But Republicans say the law gives presidents some flexibility with so-called “transfer authority” to shift already-appropriated funds toward border security. Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri has cited as an example about $900 million for fighting drug trafficking that was appropriated to the Pentagon.
Mr. Trump is increasingly delivering the message that he’s already building the wall, regardless of Congress, saying he has “options.”
“When people see what we’re doing, I think they’ll be very surprised,” he said. “We’re doing a lot of work. We’re giving out contracts right now. We have options that most people don’t really understand.”
Speaking later Wednesday to law enforcement groups, Mr. Trump vowed to “finish the border wall.”
“As we review the new proposal from Congress, I can promise you this — I will never waver from my sacred duty to defend this nation and its people,” he said. “We will get the job done. It’s happening.”
He told police chiefs and county sheriffs that the barrier will be “a big wall.”
“It’s a wall that people aren’t going through very easy,” the president said. “You’d have to be in extremely good shape to get over this one. They would be able to climb Mount Everest a lot easier, I think.”
The president, who vowed last December that he would be “proud” to shut down the government over the principle of border security, made clear that he doesn’t want to repeat the episode that forced 800,000 federal workers to go without pay for 35 days.
“A shutdown would be a terrible thing,” Mr. Trump said. “I think a lot of good points were made, but I don’t want to see another one — there’s no reason for it.”
While much of Mr. Trump’s Republican base supported the shutdown that started Dec. 22, voters overall disapproved. Gallup said Wednesday that Mr. Trump’s job-approval rating fell to 35 percent in mid-January during the shutdown, but had climbed back to 44 percent in early February after he agreed to reopen the government.
The increase was largely attributable to more-positive comments from independents, pollsters said.
A Morning Consult/Politico survey released Wednesday found that only 33 percent of respondents support a second shutdown over Mr. Trump’s demand for a border wall.
Some influential conservatives aren’t heaping as much public pressure on Mr. Trump this time to force a shutdown.
Fox News host Sean Hannity called the new agreement a “garbage compromise” when it came out Monday night, but he has since toned down his criticism, referring to the $1.3 billion as a “down payment” on the wall and suggesting the administration can find more money elsewhere in the federal budget.
“In that case, he wins big time,” Mr. Hannity said on his daily radio show.
Critics of the president are saying that he got nothing from the shutdown, because he got less for border barriers than Democrats had offered last year. But beginning with a campaign rally he held Monday night on the border in El Paso, Texas, Mr. Trump has been telling supporters that the pain of the shutdown was necessary to make his point about the urgency of the border security crisis.
He said the shutdown was worth a temporary increase in the nation’s unemployment rate.
“We had a little blip [in the unemployment rate] because of a thing called the shutdown,” Mr. Trump said. “But remember this … if we didn’t do that shutdown, we would not have been able to show this country, these politicians, the world, what the hell is happening with the border.”
He added, “That was a very important thing we did.”
White House aides also noted that the agreement provides some money for border barriers, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had dismissively offered the president $1 for wall funding in testy talks during the shutdown.
Mrs. Pelosi was urging House Democrats to support the tentative agreement Wednesday.
“As with all compromises, I say to people, support the bill for what is in it,” Mrs. Pelosi told reporters. “Don’t judge it for what is not in it. We have other days to pass other legislation.”
With lawmakers rushing to avoid another shutdown, however, some of the president’s conservative allies were urging him to pack a short-term funding extension to provide more time to study the details of the deal.
“In politics trust is everything,” said Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government. “This president has no reason to trust that Speaker Pelosi did not insert trap language into the bill, and he would be wise to verify that the proposed legislation is free from language that would prevent meaningful action to address the crisis at the border. While everyone would like to see this drama finally come to an end, it is better to get it right than to regret signing the bill later.”

6318,Trump\xe2\x80\x99s immigration offer brings sharp reactions from Dems and GOP',Fox News (Online),1/20/2019,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-immigration-offer-brings-polarized-reactions-from-dems-and-gop,"President Trump’s immigration compromise package to end the partial government shutdown drew sharp reactions from Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike.
In a televised White House address on Saturday afternoon, Trump offered Democrats a three-year extension of protections for 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, in exchange for the $5.7 billion he has been seeking for a barrier along the nation's southern border with Mexico.
HOYER URGES TRUMP, MCCONNELL TO STOP HOLDING GOVERNMENT HOSTAGE
“Our immigration system should be a source of pride ... not a source of shame as it is all over the world,” Trump said in his plea.
The president’s proposal was met with disdain from an array of top Democratic lawmakers. Many used the same language in their critiques, accusing Trump of holding the government and federal workers ""hostage.""
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted, “What we didn’t hear from the President was any sympathy for the federal workers who face so much uncertainty because of the chaos of the #TrumpShutdown.”
Before Trump made his announcement, Pelosi had called his anticipated proposal “a non-starter.”
TRUMP OFFERS IMMIGRATION COMPROMISE
“For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports.”
For his part, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, called Trump's proposal ""one-sided and ineffective.""
""It's clear the President realizes that by closing the government and hurting so many American workers and their families, he has put himself and the country in an untenable position. Unfortunately, he keeps putting forward one-sided and ineffective remedies. There's only one way out: open the government, Mr. President, and then Democrats and Republicans can have a civil discussion and come up with bipartisan solutions.""
Schumer, D-N.Y., concluded, ""It was the President who single-handedly took away DACA and TPS protections in the first place – offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking.""
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer shared a similar sentiment, urging Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell to ""stop holding government hostage and end the shutdown"" immediately.
“The president must stop holding government hostage and end the shutdown so federal employees can get back to work serving the American people. There is no reason for Americans to be shut out of work and without a paycheck while negotiations take place on the best way to secure our borders,” he said.

Hoyer said negotiation can progress after the government reopens.
“With the government open, we can negotiate an agreement to strengthen border security that both sides can support and that is in the best interests of the American people.”
Another leading Dem, Sen. Kristen Gillibrand of New York, who announced her White House bid on Jan. 15 in an episode of ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" said Trump's offer was a ""bad deal.""
Gillibrand tweeted: ""Trump ordered the end of DACA and TPS. Then he shut down the government. Now he's holding federal workers hostage, saying he'll temporarily give back what he took away -- only if we give him a pointless, ineffective wall he falsely promised Mexico would pay for. This is a bad deal.""
Then there was New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez's response. He bluntly accused Trump of forcing ""a pointless shutdown"" to pay for the border wall.
""This is about more than 800,000 Americans who are being held hostage by a President who has forced a pointless shutdown to pay for an expensive, ineffective wall. This is not about immigration. Dreamers and TPS recipients are not bargaining chips. It's unacceptable that after taking away DACA protections, eliminating the TPS program for thousands of immigrants and creating a humanitarian crisis at the border, President Trump is offering temporary solutions in exchange for a permanent wall.""
The Democratic senator also said ""a legitimate negotiation"" can proceed after the government is reopened.
Fellow Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware slammed McConnell for refusing ""to meaningfully negotiate with Senate Democrats,"" but also called Trump's offer ""a first step toward comprehensive immigration reform.""
""This senseless government shutdown is hurting millions of Americans, and its impacts are only getting worse. The President should re-open the government so that Republicans and Democrats in Congress can work with the White House to find a sensible solution on border security and immigration. I am confident that a reasonable compromise can be reached, but not while President Trump continues to keep significant parts of the government shut down and Leader McConnell refuses to meaningfully negotiate with Senate Democrats,"" he said.
""Some relief for Dreamers and an extension of Temporary Protected Status represent a first step toward comprehensive immigration reform, but more ideas from members of both parties should be taken up and debated. Republicans and Democrats stand ready to work toward a solution, but the fact remains that there is no reason to have large parts of the federal government shut down while we debate appropriate border security and immigration policies.""
Republican lawmakers, at the opposite end of the reaction spectrum, praised the president for his willingness to negotiate.
Senate Majority Leader McConnell, for instance, commended the president ""for taking bipartisan steps toward addressing current immigration issues.""
In his statement, he said; “Compromise in divided government means that everyone can’t get everything they want every time. The president’s proposal reflects that. It strikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle.""
“This bill takes a bipartisan approach to re-opening the closed portions of the federal government. It pairs the border security investment that our nation needs with additional immigration measures that both Democrat and Republican members of Congress believe are necessary. Unlike the bills that have come from the House over the past few weeks, this proposal could actually resolve this impasse. It has the full support of the President and could be signed into law to quickly reopen the government.""
Republican Whip Steve Scalise called on Democrats to match Trump's willingness to negotiate.
""The time for political games has long passed. Democrats must put their personal dislike of the president aside, end their obstruction, and finally come to the negotiating table. It's time Democrats do what is right for the functioning and security of our nation and agree to a deal that opens our government, and includes funding for a border wall and other measures to solve this serious immigration crisis at our southern border,"" he said in a statement.
Also on the Republican side, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she was ""hopeful"" for a ""constructive debate"" with Democrats.
“Compromise is not a sign of weakness — it’s a sign of strength, particularly when hundreds of thousands of families are being harmed. The Administration, Senate Republicans, and Democrats must now resolve this stalemate before 800,000 federal workers and their families miss yet another paycheck, and our economy is further damaged,” she said.
Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, whose views on the president and his policies have fluctuated, said Trump ""put forth a reasonable, good faith proposal that will reopen the government and help secure the border.""
He tweeted, ""I look forward to voting for it and will work to encourage my Republican and Democratic colleagues to do the same.
Earlier, while speaking in Ogden, Utah, Romney said he did not understand Pelosi's position on border security.
""You (Pelosi) and your fellow Democrats have voted for over 600 miles of border fence in the past, why won't you vote for another few miles now? I don't understand their position, I really don't,"" the Republican senator said.
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio took a positive view of Trump's proposed deal, like his fellow Republicans. He said Trump made ""a very reasonable offer"" and urged Democrats to work with him.
“The way to end this shutdown is for both sides to make mutual concessions in order to reach an agreement. The president has made a very reasonable offer to extend DACA and TPS protections in exchange for the border security measures he supports. I hope that instead of choosing the road of endless obstruction, Democrats will decide to work with him to reach an agreement and end the shutdown,” he said.
Likewise, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy called the president's immigration offer ""reasonable.""
McCarthy tweeted: ""President Trump has put forward a serious and reasonable offer to reform parts of our broken immigration system and reopen government. The moment now turns to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The country is watching.""

US President Donald Trump has attacked Democrats for rejecting his proposals to end the longest government shutdown in US history.
He said his plans had been dismissed before he had even presented them.
Mr Trump had offered ""compromises"" in exchange for funding for his security wall along the Mexican border, the issue that has caused the shutdown.
But Democrats called the proposals ""unacceptable"", a ""non-starter"" and ""hostage taking"".
There were two main offers in an address Mr Trump made on Saturday:
Some 700,000 so-called Dreamers, who were young when they entered the US illegally with their parents, would be protected for another three years
Some 300,000 people holding visas under Temporary Protection Status (TPS) would also get three years' protection. These are people who have fled countries affected by war or disasters
What is the latest from Mr Trump?
On Twitter, he said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats had ""turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak"".
He said his opponents ""don't see crime and drugs, they only see 2020 - which they are not going to win"".
A second tweet appeared aimed at the conservative right, which fears the offer he made on immigration would amount to an amnesty.

He tweeted: ""No. Amnesty is not part of my offer."" He said he was only talking about a three-year extension and that an amnesty would ""be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else"".
Mr Trump also said he was not planning a ""big push to remove 11 million plus people"" in the US illegally, but added a warning to Ms Pelosi to ""be careful"" on that.
What did the Democrats say?
The target of Mr Trump's anger was a statement released by Ms Pelosi anticipating - and rejecting - the concessions before they were made.
She said the proposals were ""a non-starter"" and ""a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives"".

Senator Chuck Schumer said Mr Trump had previously ""single-handedly"" taken away Dreamer and TPS protections and that offering some protections back was ""not a compromise but more hostage taking"".

The party took over control of the House this year, while Mr Trump's Republicans still have a majority in the Senate. The federal budget funding would have to be agreed by both.
Opinion polls suggest most Americans blame Mr Trump more than the Democrats for the shutdown.
Shutdown likely to drag on
Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington
Donald Trump struck a deal to reopen the government and build his much-promised wall - with one small problem. He was negotiating with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, and if he wants to succeed he's going to have to get Democrats on board.
It's a touch ironic that the deal Mr Trump outlined - his wall in exchange for protection for certain childhood undocumented migrants and temporary resident aliens - was one the president walked away from last year, when Democrats were the ones instigating a shutdown.
After senators thought they had an agreement, the White House issued new demands for reforms to legal immigration. Now Democrats are in control of the House, and the calculus has changed. Mr Trump's offer of temporary immigrant protection probably isn't any greater than the ones courts have already imposed.
The president's move may put some pressure on his opponents to return to the negotiating table, but they still feel they have the upper hand. Unless that changes - or the president backs down - the shutdown will drag on.
How is the shutdown affecting unpaid workers?
Some of the 800,000 federal employees who have been going unpaid since 22 December are in increasingly dire straits as the shutdown enters its fifth week.

4800,"Democratic lawmakers reject Trump's latest immigration proposal""",CNN (Web News),1/20/2019,,,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/19/politics/trump-border-wall-shutdown-congress-reaction/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Democratic lawmakers on Saturday rejected President Donald Trump's proposal to extend some non-permanent protections for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients and individuals with Temporary Protected Status in exchange for border wall funding.
Trump floated the offer in an afternoon speech from the White House, however, Democrats see the lack of a permanent solution for the individuals impacted by these programs as a deal-breaker.
The plan Trump proposed also includes $800 million for urgent humanitarian assistance and $805 million for drug detection technology to secure ports of entry, as well as additional border agents, law enforcement officials and new immigration judge teams to deal with cases of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border.
But all of this is on the condition that he receives $5.7 billion for a border wall -- the central point of contention between Democrats and Republicans in the fight to re-open the government.
Statements from legislators rolled in following the President's announcement:
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi
Prior to Trump's speech, Pelosi, a California Democrat, issued a statement in response to ""initial reports"" that ""make clear that his proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives.""
Her statement continued: ""It is unlikely that any one of these provisions alone would pass the House, and taken together, they are a non-starter. For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports.""
Following Trump's speech, Pelosi tweeted, ""What is original in the President's proposal is not good. What is good in the proposal is not original. Democrats will vote next week to add additional border security funding for ports of entry, advanced technology for scanning vehicles for drugs & immigration judges.""
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
Republicans issued statements of support for the President's proposal, including McConnell, who said he intends to bring the legislation forward this week. He had declined earlier to bring forward spending bills Democrats passed in the House.
""I commend the President for his leadership in proposing this bold solution to reopen the government, secure the border, and take bipartisan steps toward addressing current immigration issues,"" McConnell said in a statement.
The Republican from Kentucky called the proposal a ""a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle.""
""This bill takes a bipartisan approach to re-opening the closed portions of the federal government. It pairs the border security investment that our nation needs with additional immigration measures that both Democrat and Republican members of Congress believe are necessary. Unlike the bills that have come from the House over the past few weeks, this proposal could actually resolve this impasse. It has the full support of the President and could be signed into law to quickly reopen the government,"" he continued.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer
Schumer, a New York Democrat, called the proposal ""more hostage taking.""
""It's clear the President realizes that by closing the government and hurting so many American workers and their families, he has put himself and the country in an untenable position,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, he keeps putting forward one-sided and ineffective remedies. There's only way out: open up the government, Mr. President, and then Democrats and Republicans can have a civil discussion and come up with bipartisan solutions.""
His statement continued: ""It was the President who singled-handedly took away DACA and TPS protections in the first place -- offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking.""
Sen. Marco Rubio
Rubio, a Florida Republican, also issued a statement in favor of Trump's latest offer.
""The way to end this shutdown is for both sides to make mutual concessions in order to reach an agreement. The President has made a very reasonable offer to extend DACA and TPS protections in exchange for the border security measures he supports. I hope that instead of choosing the road of endless obstruction, Democrats will decide to work with him to reach an agreement and end the shutdown,"" Rubio said in a statement.
Sen. Dick Durbin
The Illinois Democrat is the co-author of the BRIDGE Act, which is legislation aimed at extending protection for DACA recipients, and issued a statement also rejecting the President's proposal.
""First, President Trump and Senate Majority Leader McConnell must open the government today. Second, I cannot support the proposed offer as reported and do not believe it can pass the Senate. Third, I am ready to sit down at any time after the government is opened and work to resolve all outstanding issues,"" Durbin said.
Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine
The Virginia Democrats, who represent many thousands of government employees in their state next to Washington, DC, issued a joint statement criticizing the President for not acknowledging ""the pain and suffering"" he has caused to those affected by the shutdown and said the first step to immigration reform needs to include reopening the government.
""President Trump's remarks today failed to acknowledge the pain and suffering he has caused to federal workers, contractors, and millions of Americans with this unnecessary government shutdown, and his rhetoric toward immigrants was inflammatory and unproductive,"" the statement said.
It continued, ""​We would be glad to review, starting this week, any proposals he has to responsibly improve and increase border security and provide certainty to TPS recipients and DREAMers. To start this process, we have to immediately reopen the government.""
Sen. Joe Manchin
West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin weighed in on the President's announcement in a tweet on Saturday evening, saying he was ""hopeful"" that this proposal would allow the government to open soon."
5755,"Schumer: 'Trump is a terrible negotiator'""",Washington Times,1/4/2019,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jan/4/schumer-trump-terrible-negotiator/,"Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer begged Republicans Friday to break with President Trump and vote to reopen the government without new border wall money, saying the president doesn’t know how to negotiate.
The shot came just minutes before Democratic leaders were to be at the White House to meet with Mr. Trump — and it was a cut at the president’s own self-image as a masterful deal-maker.
“President Trump is a terrible negotiator,” Mr. Schumer said.
The government shutdown reached two weeks Friday, and there’s little sign it will end soon.
Senators aren’t holding votes Friday and are expected to be out of session over the weekend and Monday. When they return Tuesday night, they have other business in front of them.
The House late Thursday passed two bills to reopen nine departments that lost funding Dec. 22, but Mr. Trump has signaled he would veto them, and Senate Republican leaders have said they won’t give the bills floor time.

4442,McConnell Faces Pressure From Republicans to Stop Avoiding Shutdown Fight',New York Times (Online News),1/4/2019,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/us/politics/mcconnell-senate-republicans-shutdown.html,"Mr. McConnell, 76, is the longest-serving Senate Republican leader in history and is a wily tactician. While he is not generally considered vulnerable, his popularity is lagging at home. A poll by Western Kentucky University last spring found that only 30 percent of Kentuckians approve of his job performance. Sticking with Mr. Trump, whose approval ratings top 50 percent in Kentucky, is in his own political interest.
But if he wants to hang onto his job as majority leader, Mr. McConnell must also be mindful of the political fortunes of Republicans seeking re-election in states won by Mrs. Clinton in 2016 or by Democrats in November. A prolonged government shutdown is the last thing those lawmakers need. And even some Republicans up for re-election in states won by Mr. Trump, like Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, sound uneasy.
“A shutdown, in my view, is a no-win proposition,” Ms. Capito said, adding that she heard complaints from Transportation Security Administration workers as she was returning to Washington for the start of the new Congress this week. Ms. Capito is the chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Department of Homeland Security; the panel has already passed a bill funding the department, including $1.6 billion for border security including fencing — but with no money for Mr. Trump’s wall.
“It is just a lot of unneeded stress on a lot of people,” she said of the shutdown.
“I would like to see it resolved soon,” said Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, who also faces re-election in 2020. She repeated herself for emphasis: “I would like to see it resolved soon.”
For Mr. McConnell, the shutdown fight presents a dynamic that is likely to become familiar over the next two years, as House Democrats rush to pass long-sought liberal policies and, in many cases, try to use the chamber to highlight Republicans’ opposition to legislative changes they believe are overwhelmingly popular. Mr. McConnell has already been burned once, having negotiated and passed through the Senate a plan to avoid the shutdown in the first place only to have Mr. Trump pull his support at the last minute.
“He faces that reality now on every issue: What’s the White House going to do with this?” said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and Mr. Schumer’s No. 2. He predicted that Mr. McConnell’s approach — to simply stand in the way so that Mr. Trump is not forced to use his veto pen — would only change if Republican senators up for re-election begin to fear political costs of carrying the president’s water.
Senator John Cornyn of Texas, Mr. McConnell’s former No. 2, compared Mr. McConnell’s task to “threading a needle.” Mr. McConnell’s former chief of staff, Josh Holmes, said it was considerably more simple than that."
6416,"Trump, Democrats dig in ahead of meeting on government shutdown'",Reuters,1/4/2019,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shutdown/trump-democrats-dig-in-ahead-of-meeting-on-government-shutdown-idUSKCN1OY0D3,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump threatened to keep the U.S. government partially shut for months or years on Friday after he and Democratic leaders failed to resolve their dispute over Trump’s request for $5.6 billion to build a wall on the Mexican border.
After Democratic congressional leaders refused Trump’s requests at a meeting in the White House Situation Room, the Republican president threatened to take the controversial step of declaring a national emergency and building the wall without congressional approval.
Trump is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures money for the wall. As a result, around 800,000 public workers have been unpaid, with about a quarter of the federal government closed for two weeks.
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats had told Trump during the meeting to end the shutdown. “He resisted,” Schumer said. “In fact, he said he’d keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.”
Trump confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting, the first since a new era of divided government began when Democrats took control of the House of Representatives on Thursday.
“We had a very, very productive meeting, and we’ve come a long way,” Trump said.
According to a source familiar with the White House discussion, Trump opened the meeting with a speech that lasted at least 15 minutes in which he insisted on the need for billions of dollars to fund a border wall.
The source also said Trump brought up recent impeachment threats during those remarks, arguing that he had notched a strong performance as president and should not be a target for impeachment.
The president later told reporters that Nancy Pelosi, the new Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, said Democrats were not looking to impeach him.
NATIONAL EMERGENCY?
Raising the stakes in his tussle with the newly emboldened Democrats, Trump threatened extraordinary measures to build the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States.
A reporter asked Trump whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall.
“Yes, I have. And I can do it if I want,” Trump said. “We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country ... I may do it. But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly. And it’s another way of doing it. But if we can do it through a negotiated process, we’re giving that a shot.”
Emergency powers have been invoked by previous U.S. presidents during times of war.
Senator Jack Reed, the senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized the comments, saying in a statement, “Declaring a trumped up national emergency in order to skirt congressional approval is wrong.”
The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the power to fund the federal government, so Trump likely would face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall. Building a wall - and having Mexico pay for it - was one of Trump’s main promises when he ran for president in 2016.

Trump’s wall project is estimated to cost about $23 billion.
Democrats have called the wall immoral, ineffective and medieval.
Pelosi said Friday’s meeting with Trump was “sometimes contentious” but that they agreed to continue talking.
“But we recognize on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president,” she said.
Credit rating agency Moody’s said the shutdown will cause minimal U.S. economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial markets and the broad economy if the closure is protracted.
A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll last week showed that 50 percent of the public blames Trump for the shutdown and 7 percent blames Republican lawmakers, while 32 percent blames Democrats.
In a Dec. 11 meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, Trump said he would be “proud” to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame Democrats. He has since said they are responsible.
White House officials and congressional staffers will meet at 11 a.m. EST (1600 GMT) on Saturday to try to end the impasse, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said.
House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters that Trump had named Vice President Mike Pence, senior aide Jared Kushner and Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen to work over the weekend.

The partial shutdown is straining the country’s immigration system, worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.
Federal agencies such as the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury have been hit by the shutdown.

“Border Security and the Wall ‘thing’ and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker!” Trump tweeted. “Let’s make a deal?”
Pelosi is poised to become speaker of the House when Democrats officially take back control of the chamber on Thursday. Trump’s comments come amid the news that House Democrats plan to introduce a legislative package to re-open the government on Thursday – though it is unclear whether Trump or Republicans in the Senate will go along with it.
Fox News has learned there is a briefing at the White House on Wednesday for the top two leaders of each party from each chamber for the new Congress to discuss the impasse.
The House Democratic plan will include one bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Feb. 8, with $1.3 billion for border security. It doesn't include money for the president's desired wall on the border.
Whether the Republican-led Senate, under Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, will consider the bills — or if Trump would sign either into law — was unclear. McConnell spokesman Donald Stewart said Senate Republicans won't not take action without Trump's backing.
""It's simple: The Senate is not going to send something to the president that he won't sign,"" Stewart said.
Even if only symbolic, the passage of the bills in the House would put fresh pressure on the president.
Republicans and Democrats have been at a standstill over President Trump's demands for $5 billion to fund the border wall. Earlier Tuesday, the president ripped into Democrats for insisting they won’t fund a border wall.
“One thing has now been proven,” Trump tweeted. “The Democrats do not care about Open Borders and all of the crime and drugs that Open Borders bring!”
Negotiations over the partial government shutdown stalled over the holidays.
“Our negotiations are at an impasse at the moment,” Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday. “I wish it were not so.”
Funding for a slew of federal agencies lapsed at midnight on Dec. 22 – just days before Christmas -- after Congress and the White House failed to pass a spending package. Nine of 15 Cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies have closed, affecting about a quarter of the federal government.
With no resolution in sight, the shutdown is forcing hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors to stay home or work without pay. Museums and galleries popular with visitors and locals in the nation's capital will close starting midweek if the partial shutdown of the federal government drags on.

4903,Trump invites congressional leaders to border security briefing',Reuters,1/1/2019,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shutdown-trump/trump-invites-congressional-leaders-to-border-security-briefing-idUSKCN1OV1R2,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday invited Republican and Democratic congressional leaders to a border security briefing at the White House as the federal government remained partially shut down over his demand to fund a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

The president’s invitation, which was described by congressional sources as a briefing and not a negotiating session, was sent to the top two Democrats and Republicans in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.
Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office said he would attend the briefing, which is set for Wednesday. It was unclear whether the other leaders would participate, one source said.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the specifics of the briefing.
The House and Senate will reconvene briefly on Wednesday to mark the last day of the Republican-controlled 2017-2018 Congress, with no signs of a workable plan to end the shutdown, which is now in its second week.
About a quarter of the federal government is shut down, with roughly 800,000 workers affected.
Democrats, who won control of the House in the November elections, plan to approve on Thursday a two-part spending package meant to end the shutdown. But its prospects are grim in the Republican-led Senate, which previously approved similar measures on the floor or in committee but has since fallen in line with Trump’s demands for funding for the border wall.
The legislation will set the stage for the first major battle of the new Congress between House Democrats led by Nancy Pelosi and Senate Republicans led by McConnell.
“We are giving the Republicans the opportunity to take yes for an answer,” Pelosi, who is expected to be the House speaker, said in a letter to colleagues released by her office on Tuesday.
“Senate Republicans have already supported this legislation, and if they reject it now, they will be fully complicit in chaos and destruction of the president’s third shutdown of his term.”
Trump triggered the shutdown, which began on Dec. 22, by insisting that $5 billion in funding for the border wall be part of any spending measure.
“Border Security and the Wall ‘thing’ and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let’s make a deal?” Trump tweeted on Tuesday.
Trump calls the wall crucial to curbing illegal immigration, echoing his 2016 presidential campaign pledge. During his run for the White House, Trump insisted Mexico would pay for the wall.
The Democrats’ two-part spending package includes a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Feb. 8 and provide $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security items including technology and cameras.
The second part of the package would fund federal agencies that are now unfunded, such as the Justice, Commerce and Transportation departments, through Sept. 30, the end of the federal fiscal year.
The House Democrats’ measure does not contain the $5 billion Trump wants in wall funding. McConnell has said Senate Republicans will not approve a spending measure not supported by Trump."

Democrats, who had been debating what package of spending bills to bring to the floor this week, settled on Monday on a plan to pass six full-year spending bills that would fund most of the government through September 2019. They also included a short-term patch extending current funding through Feb. 8 for the Department of Homeland..."

AD
House Democrats plan to use their new majority to vote through measures that would reopen nearly all of the shuttered federal agencies through the end of September, at funding levels Senate Republicans have previously agreed to. Those spending bills contain scores of priorities and pet projects for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.
AD
The Democratic proposal holds out one exception: The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border security, would keep its current level of funding, with no new money for a border wall. The plan would also extend the department’s budget only through Feb. 8, allowing Democrats to revisit funding for key parts of Trump’s immigration policy in a month.
“The President is using the government shutdown to try to force an expensive and ineffective wall upon the American people, but Democrats have offered two bills which separate the arguments over the wall from the government shutdown,” read a joint statement from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the likely next House speaker, and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).
AD
Republican leaders would have the option to pass the bipartisan bills, reopening much of the government while the border fight continued, but doing so could diminish Trump’s leverage as he demands billions in taxpayer funding for a wall.
AD
On Monday, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the Senate, which will remain under Republican control, will bring up only legislation that has the president’s blessing.
“It’s simple: The Senate is not going to send something to the president that he won’t sign,” Don Stewart, McConnell’s spokesman, wrote in an email Monday.
The president has asked for $5 billion in border money, far beyond the $1.3 billion that Democrats plan to vote through this week. Trump on Monday invited Democrats to continue negotiations but reiterated that he had no plans to back down.
AD
“They can come over right now, they could’ve come over anytime. I spent Christmas in the White House, I spent New Year’s Eve now in the White House. And you know, I’m here, I’m ready to go. It’s very important,” he said in an interview with Fox News that’s airing Monday evening during the network’s New Year’s Eve programming.
AD
“We are not giving up. We have to have border security, and the wall is a big part of border security,” he said.
Asked when he expects to meet with Schumer and Pelosi, Trump replied, “I assume when they get back.”
The White House did not comment Monday on House Democrats’ plan.
One of Trump’s close congressional allies, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), dismissed the proposal from Democrats.
AD
“Nancy Pelosi’s newest funding proposal doesn’t represent any serious attempt to secure our border or find a compromise,” Meadows wrote on Twitter, adding that the plan was “a non-starter and will not be a legitimate answer to this impasse.”
The deadlock has resulted in what is already the longest partial government shutdown since a 16-day standoff in 2013 over the Affordable Care Act.
Some 800,000 federal workers have been affected, with an estimated 350,000 furloughed at home and the others still working because their jobs are deemed “essential.” Thus far workers have not missed a paycheck, but that will begin to happen if the shutdown is not resolved soon. Many federal contractors are without work as well.
AD
AD
“The biggest reaction still remains anxiety: When will this end?” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D), whose Northern Virginia district is home to tens of thousands of federal workers. “Coupled with now the creeping reality of the financial consequences if this goes on too long, everything from ‘Can I pay rent on time?’ to ‘What kind of obligations, if any, can I incur while it’s uncertain whether I get a paycheck?’ ”
The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, representing some 700,000 workers, on Monday announced that it was suing the federal government over the shutdown, writing in a statement that “the federal government is violating the law by requiring some federal employees to work without pay during a shutdown.”
In an issue unrelated to the border wall but important to federal workers, the package of full-year bills that Democrats plan to pass would include a 1.9 percent raise for civilian workers that Trump has sought to deny.
AD
AD
In December, Senate Republicans signed off on a plan that would have averted the shutdown but did not include new wall money, only to have Trump publicly denounce the proposal the next day. McConnell, who will remain in charge of the Senate in 2019 as the House flips to Democratic control, does not want to put his lawmakers in that position again.
The construction of a wall along the Mexican border was one of Trump’s top promises in the 2016 campaign and early in his presidency, and he vowed to make Mexico pay for it. More recently, he has asked for taxpayer money to build the wall and said Mexico will indirectly pay for it later, but his aides have struggled to explain how that will happen.
Pelosi, who is expected to be elected speaker this week, has called the wall “immoral” and said her new majority will not pay for it.
AD
AD
House Democrats settled on the approach of funding the Department of Homeland Security on a short-term basis after liberals objected to a proposal to fund the agency through the rest of the 2019 fiscal year, even without increasing spending at the border.
A coalition of advocacy groups, including the ACLU, sent Pelosi and Schumer a letter Friday opposing extending funding for the Department of Homeland Security for a full year, citing concerns that such an approach “clearly funds Trump’s wall project and must be rejected.”
A spokeswoman for the ACLU said Monday that the group supports extending Homeland Security funding to Feb. 8, which would allow newly empowered Democrats more latitude in determining the agency’s budget for the remainder of fiscal 2019.
AD
Trump canceled a planned trip to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., to stay in Washington to deal with the shutdown, but he has not been in touch with Democratic leaders. There have been no face-to-face negotiations since Vice President Pence and others held meetings at the Capitol on Dec. 22, the day the shutdown began. Pence made Democrats an offer that lowered proposed spending on the wall, but they rejected it in part because it included what they called a $400,000 “slush fund” that Trump could have spent on other immigration priorities.
AD
Despite Republicans holding a bigger majority in the Senate in the next Congress, some Democratic votes will still be needed to pass funding legislation there, and Democratic senators, even more moderate ones, have been resolute against money for a wall.
That much was clear soon after the November midterms, when Schumer started gauging where Democratic senators stood on $5 billion for a border wall through one-on-one conversations in his office. Repeatedly, Democratic senators told Schumer that they would support money for border security but not Trump’s specific request, according to a person familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe them.
The agencies affected by the shutdown make up about 25 percent of the portion of the federal government that is funded by Congress. The Pentagon is mostly not affected, since a spending bill for the military was passed by Congress and signed by Trump in 2018. Congress and the president also passed legislation to fund the Labor Department, the Health and Human Services Department and others, before Trump’s demands for wall money ground negotiations on other spending bills to a halt.
AD
Programs such as Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid also are unaffected, since their budgets proceed automatically, without the need for annual congressional appropriations. The Russia investigation of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III also is unaffected since it is paid for by a permanent, dedicated funding stream."
4386,"Dems' plan to end shutdown punts border battle into February""",Washington Times,12/31/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/dec/31/democrats-announce-plan-end-shutdown/,"Democrats announced a plan Monday to try to reopen the government by passing a package of Senate-written bills to fund most remaining parts of government for all of 2019, coupled with stopgap funding through Feb. 8 for Homeland Security.
That plan has repeatedly been rejected in principle by the White House, but Democrats, about to take control of the House when the new Congress convenes Thursday, say they’ll try to force action on it.
They said their goal was to separate Mr. Trump’s demand for a border wall from the ongoing government shutdown, reopening government while putting off a fight over homeland security’s budget for several weeks.
Rep. Nancy Pelosi, poised to become House speaker, and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, said senators have already voted for a Feb. 8 funding bill during votes two weeks ago.
“It would be the height of irresponsibility and political cynicism for Senate Republicans to now reject the same legislation they have already supported,” the leaders said.
Their hope is to isolate Mr. Trump, whose demand for border funding has sent the government into a generally painless shutdown.
While most of government is still operating, some 25 percent of discretionary money expired Dec. 21. The holidays have muted much of the impact, and some agencies continued to function on leftover money, postponing real effects for most Americans.

President Donald Trump’s Border Patrol chief on Sunday called the deaths of two Guatemalan children who perished while in government custody this month “absolutely devastating” and said immigration enforcement agents “did everything they could” to prevent the tragedies.
“Just absolutely devastating for us on every level. It’s been over a decade since we’ve had a child die anywhere in our processes,” Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said on ABC’s “This Week.”

“What I can tell you about these two cases — and I’ve looked at our operation reporting, the initial investigative reporting, I looked at the fathers’ statements and interviews — is that our agents did everything they could as soon as these children manifested symptoms of illness to save their lives,” McAleenan said.
Seven-year-old Jakelin Caal crossed the border with her father and a group of migrants on Dec. 6 before surrendering to Border Patrol personnel near Lordsburg, N.M. After she began experiencing seizures, Caal was flown to a hospital in El Paso, Texas, where she died two days later. The Washington Post reported that Caal died of dehydration .
Eight-year-old Felipe Gomez Alonzo was arrested with his father by immigration agents in El Paso on Dec. 18. He died late Christmas Eve at a New Mexico hospital after suffering coughing, vomiting and a fever, according to law enforcement. New Mexico authorities say an autopsy revealed the boy had the flu, according to The Associated Press.
McAleenan on Sunday said he and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen have directed border officials to perform medical checks of children ages 17 and under who are entering the immigration process, as well as those already in government custody.
“That’s not a capacity we’ve had in the past,” McAleenan said.
“We’re also trying to — to really change the system so that we have the capacity — either with doctors, physicians assistants, paramedics — to do an initial intake check so that we know if a child is healthy as they arrive at the border and then make sure they can get medical care if they need it,” he added.
McAleenan also said he has already allocated increased agency funding toward “medical care and mental health care for children entering our custody.”

Enlarge this image toggle caption Paul Ratje/AFP/Getty Images Paul Ratje/AFP/Getty Images
Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen traveled to Texas and Arizona on Friday and Saturday, citing an ""unprecedented"" increase in the apprehensions of families and unaccompanied children at the U.S.-Mexico border.
""The system is clearly overwhelmed,"" Nielsen said in a statement. Nearly 50,000 family units were caught by the U.S. Border Patrol in October and November, according to Department of Homeland Security data, a fourfold increase over the same period last year.
The secretary's visit comes as her department is under scrutiny for the recent deaths of two Guatemalan migrant children in U.S. custody. On Monday, 8-year old Felipe Gomez-Alonza died after coming down with the flu, and 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin died earlier this month of shock and dehydration. Nielsen's trip began in El Paso, Texas where Gomez-Alonza was apprehended, and where Maquin died.
Earlier this week, Nielsen called the 8-year old's death ""deeply concerning and heartbreaking"" and announced new medical screening procedures for all child migrants – both those travelling with family members and those who arrive unaccompanied. In El Paso, they are being examined at a network of hospitals and pop-up clinics staffed by volunteers. As of Friday, nearly 150 children had been screened under the new procedures and at least four had been admitted to an area hospital, according to the Border Regional Advisory Council, a non-profit that is helping coordinate the check-ups.
On Saturday, President Trump blamed Democrats for the two children's deaths.
Trump has repeatedly made unsupported claims about the dangers posed by incoming migrants; his controversial campaign-promise of a new border wall is at the center of congressional gridlock that has temporarily shuttered the federal government.
Without citing specific numbers, Nielsen said this week that there has been an increase in sick children crossing America's southern border. Alan Shapiro, a pediatrician who treats and advocates for immigrant children told Yahoo News that the claim is ""disingenuous"" adding that ""there's an uptick everywhere in the country of viral illnesses in winter. That's not specific to migrants.""
As NPR's Joel Rose has reported, bleak living conditions and a lack of sanitation inside government detention facilities can also make migrant children sick. A group of Democratic lawmakers say that when Congress returns to Washington, D.C., next week they will ""hold hearings and conduct oversight of the two deaths that occurred earlier this month, as well as the conditions under which thousands of children are being held in DHS custody.""
In El Paso on Friday, Nielsen met with the sector chief and staff at two border patrol stations, as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement leadership, and U.S. Coast Guard medical personnel who are advising the Border Patrol on new screening protocols.
Nielsen also had a conversation with the city's Republican mayor, Dee Margo, who welcomed her visit.
Margo told NPR that among the topics they discussed was the release of 400 migrants in downtown El Paso earlier this week by ICE officers. The move caught city officials and local aid agencies off-guard, as the migrants were left without food, shelter or a place to go. Margo dismissed the unexpected drop-off as a ""glitch.""
On Saturday morning, Nielsen continued her tour in Yuma, Ariz. Details of that visit were not immediately available.
Last week, Nielsen announced a new policy that will require asylum seekers at the southern border to wait in Mexico while their claims are processed. If it is implemented, more children will likely be housed in already-strained Mexican shelters, in areas where gangs routinely target migrants.

5815,Trump blames Democrats for deaths of migrant children at border',Washington Times,12/30/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/dec/29/donald-trump-blames-democrats-deaths-migrant-child/,"President Trump blamed congressional Democrats Saturday for the deaths of migrant children at the border, saying liberals’ “pathetic” immigration policies have encouraged foreign families to attempt the dangerous journey.
“Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “They can’t. If we had a Wall, they wouldn’t even try!”
House Democrats ordered Homeland Security officials this week to preserve all “evidence” related to the two deaths this month of Guatemalan children who jumped the U.S.-Mexico border with their parents, signaling an investigation next month.
An 8-year-old boy, Felipe Gomez Alonzo, died on Christmas Eve after six days in Border Patrol custody. He had been treated for a cold and fever at a hospital and was released, but was readmitted hours later — and died soon thereafter.
His mother in Guatemala said the boy’s father brought the child on the trip to the U.S. in the belief that gaining illegal entry would be easier with a child.
Earlier this month, a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died after being arrested for crossing the border illegally with her father. Border Patrol agents twice managed to revive her after she fell ill, but she later suffered a heart attack and liver and respiratory failure at a hospital.
Mr. Trump said the two children “were very sick before they were given over to Border Patrol.”
“The father of the young girl said it was not their fault, he hadn’t given her water in days,” the president tweeted. “Border Patrol needs the Wall and it will all end. They are working so hard & getting so little credit!”

""We build a wall or we close the southern border,"" he said in a series of Friday morning tweets.

Still, as the partial government shutdown enters day seven, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told ""CBS This Morning"" Friday that Mr. Trump is ""willing to negotiate"" with Democrats on the $5 billion he is requesting to fund the wall.
Sanders blasted Democrats for the standoff that is now expected to keep roughly 800,000 federal workers from receiving paychecks into the New Year, claiming they have ""left the table altogether"" but not offering details on what the president might be willing to agree to.
""I'm not going to negotiate in the press, but the president has been willing to negotiate on this point and the Democrats have not been willing to do anything,"" Sanders said. ""It's a very sad day when we can't get Democrats to even show up for work and sit down with us and have these conversations and try to help make real solutions and get something done.""
Mulvaney also said negotiations have completely shut down, and repeated Sanders' argument that Democrats were more interested in protecting Nancy Pelosi's speakership than the border. Because of this, he said, they did not expect anything substantive until she was elected speaker by Democrat majority on January 3.
Mr. Trump, for his part, plans to stay in Washington in the coming days. Sanders told reporters that ""there are no plans as of now"" for the president to travel to his resort at Mar-a-Lago. The president had been expected at the Florida resort for New Year's Eve."

The tweetstorm came amid the partial government shutdown that will soon enter its second week. The closures began last Saturday after Republicans and Democrats were unable to agree on a funding package that would keep the government open and fund Trump’s promised border wall. Trump has demanded $5 billion for the barrier, but Democrats have refused, instead offering $1.3 billion for general border security.

With both sides refusing to budge and little activity on Capitol Hill amid the holiday break, there are no signs of the impasse ending anytime soon. One member of the House Republican leadership told Fox News on Thursday that a resolution may not emerge until the new year.
But on Friday, Trump not only renewed his demands for the wall, but threatened numerous consequences in the absence of that money. He even suggested pulling back on the recently renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which now goes by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
“The United States looses [sic] soooo much money on Trade with Mexico under NAFTA, over 75 Billion Dollars a year (not including Drug Money which would be many times that amount), that I would consider closing the Southern Border a 'profit making operation,'"" he tweeted.
“Bring our car industry back into the United States where it belongs. Go back to pre-NAFTA, before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to Mexico,” he carried on. “Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border.”
He then said the U.S. would terminate aid with Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, which he said are doing “nothing for the United States but taking our money,” and referred to reports that another caravan of migrants hoping to get to the U.S. is planning on leaving Honduras in January.
“Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it. We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!” he said.
Trump has previously threatened to shut down the border, but took no action to do so following those threats. He also previously threatened to cut aid to countries that assist, or do nothing to stop, the caravans. But earlier this month, the U.S. pledged a total of $10.6 billion in aid and investment for Central America and southern Mexico -- as part of a push to promote better security and job opportunities so that Central Americans and Mexicans do not have to emigrate to the U.S.
NIELSEN ANNOUNCES DEAL WITH MEXICO TO OVERHAUL ASYLUM PROCESS, COMBAT 'CATCH AND RELEASE'
A cut-off of trade relations with Mexico could also risk a new agreement that DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced this month that calls for immigrants claiming asylum in the U.S. to be returned to Mexico as their cases are processed.
Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s incoming acting chief of staff, claimed Friday on “Fox & Friends” that it appeared Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is interested in a deal but Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi is preventing it. He alleged Democrats are not dealing because Pelosi is waiting until she secures the speakership.
“We don’t think they will [negotiate] until after the new Congress is sworn in,” he said.
But Pelosi has denied claims they haven't provided a counteroffer.
""Democrats have offered Republicans three options to re-open government that all include funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security – but not the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall,"" said Drew Hammill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff. ""With the House Majority, Democrats will act swiftly to end the Trump Shutdown, and will fight for a strategic, robust national security policy, including strong and smart border security, and strong support for our servicemembers and veterans.""

3027,"Donald Trump, venting fury over budget fight, threatens to close U.S.-Mexico border'",USA TODAY,12/28/2018,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/28/donald-trump-threatens-close-u-s-mexico-border/2430052002/,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump threatened Friday to close the U.S. border with Mexico if Democrats keep opposing funding for his proposed wall, but he did not spell out how he would carry out such a policy or its broader impact.
""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" Trump tweeted.
Trump has made the threat before but has not offered details. Illegal crossings are at the heart of his dispute with congressional Democrats over funding for a proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
It's also uncertain how closing the border would affect migration. Many people seeking to enter the United States claim political asylum, and the government is required to consider those requests regardless of border closures.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that in November ""51,856 people were apprehended between ports of entry on the Southwest Border.""
There were an estimated 10.7 million undocumented immigrants already living in the United States in 2016, a 12-year low, according to the most recent statistics compiled by the Pew Research Center.
The partial government shutdown began after Trump refused to endorse a temporary spending bill because it lacked full funding for the border wall. Senate Democrats, meanwhile, blocked a revised plan that included wall money, describing Trump's barrier as an unnecessary waste of money that has now caused a temporary government shutdown.
""This isn't about security. It's Trump trying to get taxpayers to fund what Mexico won't – a monument to him at the border,"" said Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson. ""He's taken taxpayers hostage, and now he's upping the ransom demands.""
Trump tweeted amid signs that the partial government shutdown that began a week ago will likely go on into the new year and the new Congress.
House and Senate leaders have said no votes are scheduled in the near term.
The new Congress is scheduled to convene Jan. 3, including a new Democratic majority in the House.
In an interview with USA TODAY this week, incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats have no plans to support Trump's wall funding. She said the president is using fact-free ""scare tactics"" to stump for his wall, and has frequently changed his demands.
""First of all, the fact ... that he says, ‘we're going to build a wall with cement, and Mexico's going to pay for it’ while he's already backed off of the cement,"" Pelosi said. ""Now he's down to, I think, a beaded curtain or something, I'm not sure where he is.""
In a Friday morning tweet storm, Trump appeared to argue that closing the southern border would improve U.S. trade with Mexico, even though a full closure would presumably curtail the movement of goods and services over the border.
In November, U.S. officials closed the San Ysidro border crossing near San Diego, California, for five hours following a confrontation between migrants and U.S. authorities. The San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce later estimated a one-day loss of $5.3 million for more than 700 local businesses.
Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, said Trump could be talking about closing formal ports of entry like the one at San Ysidro. The government is already trying to harden the many areas between formal ports of entry,
""We're doing everything we can between points of entry,"" Pierce said.
In his tweets, Trump also again said he would consider cutting foreign aid to countries he claims are not doing enough to stop migration, specifically citing Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
Reiterating his threat, Trump said in one post: ""Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border.""
In October, just a few weeks before pivotal congressional elections, Trump threatened to close the southern border.
""I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!"" he wrote on Twitter.
Mexican officials have said they are trying to work with U.S. officials to keep asylum seekers in Mexico until their claims move through U.S. courts.
Trump also threatened to close the border – ""permanently if need be"" – in a tweet on Nov. 26, weeks after elections in which Democrats won control of the U.S. House and as the wall funding dispute was building."
5936,"DHS begs for help, orders full review after second migrant child's death""",Washington Times,12/26/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/dec/26/dhs-begs-help-orders-full-review-after-second-migr/,"Border officials begged for medical help from the Coast Guard and the Pentagon to screen illegal immigrants and asked American and Mexican disease specialists to investigate a surge of sick migrants caught at the border after another illegal immigrant child died in U.S. custody.
Every juvenile currently held by U.S. Customs and Border Protection is being rechecked for health issues, and a review of CBP procedures is underway, authorities said after the death on Christmas Eve.
This one involved an 8-year-old boy who jumped the border with his father on Dec. 18. They had been shuttled to four CBP facilities and one hospital in the six days before the boy’s death.
CBP said more than two dozen “welfare checks” were performed during those six days and it wasn’t until the final day that the boy showed any problems. He was treated at a hospital and released just hours before falling ill again, and he died soon after he was readmitted.
“This is a tragic loss,” CBP Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan said in a statement late Tuesday. “Our deepest sympathies go out to the family.”
The death has fueled an already raging debate over CBP’s handling of the surge of illegal immigrant families that is straining Homeland Security’s abilities. Democrats in Congress and immigrant rights activists across the country have said the blood of children is on the government’s hands and insist that bad policies and poor attitudes have contributed to the deaths.
A 7-year-old girl arrived at the border this month in remote New Mexico with her father, and it took some time to get her to a processing facility. En route, she began vomiting and then stopped breathing. Agents managed to revive her twice, but she died a day later at a hospital after suffering liver and respiratory failure and a heart attack.
Administration officials say a long, rough journey through Mexico must have compromised the girl’s health and she was in U.S. custody for mere hours.
The latest case is tougher to wave away.
Guatemalan officials said Tuesday that the father insisted the boy was healthy when they arrived and were arrested as part of a group of migrants just west of El Paso, Texas, in the early afternoon of Dec. 18.
Homeland Security officials, though, said they have seen a rise in the number of ill migrants crossing the border and that “dozens of people a day” in Border Patrol facilities need medical treatment.
“It is now clear that migrants, particularly children, are increasingly facing medical challenges and harboring illness caused by their long and dangerous journey,” Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement.
She said she has asked the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to look into the cases and has asked Mexican authorities to investigate shelters south of the border where migrants from Central America hole up while waiting for the OK from smugglers to attempt to cross.
Homeland Security officials said those shelters are likely causes of the spread of disease.
In the case of the boy who died this week, authorities said they spotted signs of flu and took him to a hospital, where he was tested for strep throat. A common cold was diagnosed, and the boy was given Tylenol. While being held for observation, he ran a fever of 103 degrees. Amoxicillin and ibuprofen were prescribed, and the boy was released.
He later vomited, but his father refused more medical attention and said the boy’s health was improving. Hours later, a Border Patrol agent said the boy had “glossy eyes.” While he was being transported back to Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center, he vomited again and lost consciousness, officials said.
He was declared dead a little more than 40 minutes later.
Congressional Democrats vowed to investigate when they take control of the House next year.
“It is incumbent upon Congress to ask serious questions about what happened and who bears responsibility,” said Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat who is poised to become majority leader.
An internal CBP review is underway for the deaths of the girl and the boy this month, and the Homeland Security inspector general has announced an investigation into the girl’s death.
A Homeland Security official said deaths of children in CBP custody are rare and that none had been reported for a decade.
Officials suggested that the problem lay south of the border. Smugglers are encouraging a surge of migrants — particularly families with young children — to make the trip from Central America to the U.S. The migrants are convinced they can take advantage of lax policies to gain an illegal foothold in the U.S.
“Our system has been pushed to a breaking point by those who seek open borders. Smugglers, traffickers and their own parents put these minors at risk by embarking on the dangerous and arduous journey north,” Ms. Nielsen said.
Department officials said they have been pleading with Congress to change laws to cut down on abuses of the asylum process and to allow illegal immigrant families to be held in detention, which would make it easier to deport them.
If Central Americans fail to enter the U.S., then relatives and neighbors would be discouraged from making the trip, the government hopes.
The Obama administration took the same approach in 2014 and 2015 to deal with a surge of families, but it has drawn far more outrage this time.
A Homeland Security official who briefed reporters Wednesday — but would not allow himself to be identified — said it’s time for action.
“We have been sounding the alarm on this for months, and we’ve been seeking additional support, action, from Congress and the courts to deal with this. We have yet to see that assistance,” the official said. “We have been doing all we can under our authorities to handle this strain.”
The department released a timeline of events in the latest death beginning with the early-afternoon arrest Dec. 18 as part of a group of migrants snared just west of the El Paso border crossing.
The migrants were kept in the field for more than three hours, said CBP, blaming the difficulty of finding transportation.
By late afternoon, the migrants were at an initial processing center, where they were given food and water and were kept for two days. They were transported to another CBP facility, where they stayed for another two nights.
Between those two locations, they were given 23 welfare checks. During these checks, agents give visual examinations and ask whether the migrants need anything or whether anything is wrong.
On Sunday, because of overcrowding at the El Paso facility, the group of migrants was transported to a facility in New Mexico. On Monday — six days after the arrests — CBP contacted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for a more permanent placement.
Just hours later on the morning of Christmas Eve, an agent noticed the boy coughing and reported that he had “glossy eyes.” Half an hour later, the boy was taken to a hospital for a flu check.
After his release in the middle of the afternoon, the boy was sent to a temporary facility at a Border Patrol checkpoint, where he had a meal and was given a dose of the medications.
At 7 p.m., still at the checkpoint, the boy vomited. Agents cleaned up the vomit but said the father refused further medical assistance.
At 10 p.m., the child was observed to be lethargic. Because no agent on duty had emergency medical skills, the boy was taken back to the hospital. He vomited and lost consciousness in the hour between the emergence of his condition and his arrival at the hospital. He was pronounced dead about 40 minutes after arrival.

4987,"The final days of Felipe Alonzo-Gomez, the 8-year-old migrant who died in US custody'",CNN (Web News),12/26/2018,,,https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/26/us/cbp-timeline-guatemala-boy-dies/index.html,"(CNN) An 8-year-old migrant's last days were a blur of border patrol stations and hospital visits in a location about 2,000 miles from his family's home in Guatemala.
The boy's death while in the custody of US Customs and Border Protection comes just weeks after a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died while being held by CBP. He was identified as Felipe Alonzo-Gomez by US Rep. Joaquin Castro, but CBP did not name him.
The children's deaths have highlighted the life-and-death challenges that migrants face in attempting to come to the US and caused CBP to announce several policy changes around its care of children under 10 years old.
CBP released the following timeline based on the current understanding of Felipe's final days and the hours leading up to his death late Christmas Eve. The dates and times below are in local time.
December 18
About 1 p.m.
Felipe was apprehended with his father at a location about 3 miles west of the Paso Del Norte port of entry in El Paso, Texas for illegal entry.
That apprehension location is a less than 15-minute drive from the Paso Del Norte port, but groups may be detained in the field until transportation is available.
4:39 p.m.
Felipe and his father were transferred to the Paso Del Norte processing center. While detained there, they were provided hot food, snacks, juice, and water, and the agents logged six welfare checks.

Over the next two days, Felipe and his father were provided with showers, food, juice, and water, and the agents logged 17 welfare checks.
December 22
11:17 p.m.
Border Patrol transferred Felipe and his father to the Alamogordo Border Patrol Station in Alamogordo, New Mexico to finalize processing. They were transferred because of capacity levels at the El Paso station.
Alamogordo is about 80 miles away from the El Paso station.
December 23

5:39 a.m.
A placement request for Felipe and his father was emailed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Enforcement and Removal Operations.
9 a.m.
A processing agent noticed that the child was coughing and appeared to have glossy eyes. About 30 minutes later, based on the agents' observations, Felipe was transferred to Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center in Alamogordo with possible influenza symptoms. He was accompanied by his father.
11:30 a.m.
Hospital staff conducted several tests on Felipe for strep throat.
12:45 p.m.

Felipe appeared to be nauseous and vomited. Agents were aware of this and helped clean up the vomit. His father declined further medical assistance as the child had been feeling better.
10 p.m.
Felipe appeared lethargic and nauseous again.
Because no EMT was on duty, out of caution, agents made the decision to return Felipe and his father to Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center.
During transportation to the hospital, he began to vomit and lost consciousness.
11:07 p.m.
Radio traffic indicated that the agent had arrived at the medical center, where he was met by hospital staff.
11:48 p.m.
Hospital staff were unable to revive Felipe and pronounced him dead.
December 25
7:40 a.m.

5476,Medical checks ordered for all kids held in US custody after death of 2nd immigrant child this month',USA TODAY,12/26/2018,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/12/26/guatemalan-boy-death-medical-checks-immigrant-children-custody/2413058002/,"Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen on Wednesday called the death on Christmas Eve of an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy in federal detention a ""deeply concerning and heartbreaking"" tragedy and cited U.S. immigration system failings for a growing border crisis.
The top Trump administration border security official spoke out after directing a series of actions to care for undocumented immigrants taken into custody after illegal Mexican-U.S. crossings. The moves include U.S. Customs and Border Protection medical exams for all children it holds in custody.
The statement and actions marked the latest federal response to the death of the boy identified by Guatemalan officials as Felipe Gómez Alonzo. He was pronounced dead at 11:48 p.m. MST on Monday after he fell ill while held in CBP custody with his father, Agustín Gomez.
Felipe was the second immigrant child to die while in federal detention this month.
In a statement to the El Paso Times, BorderRAC Executive Director Wanda Helgesen said that as of Wednesday morning, 450 minors had been screened at regional medical facilities in the Border Patrol's El Paso sector, which includes New Mexico.
Details on the specific number of migrant patients at each facility were not available late Wednesday.
Nielsen's formal statement cited a recent jump in illegal border crossings by immigrant families and unaccompanied children. CBP apprehensions in those categories rose 86 percent – more than 68,000 family units and almost 14,000 unaccompanied children – over last year’s totals for the most recent two months along the Southwest border, she said.
""Our system has been pushed to a breaking point by those who seek open borders. Smugglers, traffickers and their own parents put these minors at risk by embarking on the dangerous and arduous journey north,"" Nielsen said.
""This crisis is exacerbated by the increase in persons who are entering our custody suffering from severe respiratory illnesses or exhibit some other illness upon apprehension,"" she said. ""Given the remote locations of their illegal crossing and the lack of resources, it is even more difficult for our personnel to be first responders.""
Nielsen said the changing immigration dynamic has been spurred by ""an immigration system that rewards parents for sending their children across the border alone,"" without requiring the adults to face ""consequences for their actions.""
She cited an asylum process that’s unable to provide swift help for qualified applicants and an immigration system that encourages fraudulent claims by border crossers. She noted nine of 10 asylum applications get rejected by immigration judges.
Nielsen said she contacted Mexican border officials to seek an investigation into ""the cause of these illnesses on their side of the border and to provide medical assistance in shelters as needed.""
She planned a trip to CBP patrol stations this week to review medical screenings and conditions – conditions that have spurred questions and criticism among some Democrats.
The updated health testing directed by Nielsen marks a change in the handling of young children detained after entering the USA without required documentation and comes amid a partial shutdown of the federal government over President Donald Trump's demand for $5 billion to build a security wall at the nation's southern border with Mexico.
CBP said Tuesday night that it started secondary medical checks beyond initial border screening on all children in custody. More than 95 percent of those children had been re-examined by paramedics, emergency medical technicians or medical facilities near the border, the officials said Wednesday.
In a background phone briefing Wednesday, the officials said CBP is considering options from other federal agencies to help provide increased medical assistance for young immigrants at the border. Along with support from the U.S. Coast Guard, assistance could come from the Department of Defense, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services.
The CBP update included a timetable of events leading to the latest death. It showed that the boy and his father had been in custody since Dec. 18.
A CBP agent noticed that the boy ""was coughing and appeared to have glossy eyes"" at approximately 9 a.m. MST on Monday. Taken with his father to a hospital in Alamogordo, New Mexico, he was diagnosed with a cold and a fever, prescribed amoxicillin and Ibuprofen and was released Monday afternoon after being held 90 minutes for observation, CBP said.
The boy was returned to the hospital Monday evening with nausea and vomiting and died hours later, CBP said. The hospital – the Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center – declined to comment Tuesday, citing privacy regulations.
The federal officials on Wednesday declined to discuss the hospital's earlier decision to release Felipe. Such decisions are left to medical professionals and are not made by CBP, they said.
“This is a tragic loss,"" CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said in a written statement. ""On behalf of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, our deepest sympathies go out to the family.""
The official cause of the boy's death had not immediately been determined, pending results of an autopsy. CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility and the Office of Inspector General will conduct a review, the officials said.
CBP asked the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to seek potential causes for a recent increase in the number of migrants in U.S. border areas who require medical aid. CBP personnel have transported ""dozens"" of people per day to hospitals for care in recent months, the officials said.
An official headcount on the number of immigrant children in CBP custody was not immediately available. The officials estimated Wednesday that families with children and unaccompanied immigrant children accounted for 1,400 to 1,500 of the roughly 2,100 people who are apprehended or detained at border areas each day.
Oscar Padilla, the Guatemalan consul in Phoenix, said Felipe's father told him the two had traveled to the USA from their home in Nentón, a village about 280 miles from Guatemala City. They planned to go to Johnson City, Tennessee. The consul identified the 47-year-old father and said he remains in U.S. Border Patrol custody.
The Border Patrol apprehended the father and son Dec. 18 for illegal entry, about 3 miles west of the Paso Del Norte Port of Entry in El Paso, Texas. Agents detained them at that port's processing center, logging six welfare checks until Thursday when they moved them to the El Paso Border Patrol Station.
There, the agency said it logged an additional 17 welfare checks before transferring them to Alamogordo Station on Sunday to finalize processing because of capacity levels at El Paso.
Agents conducted several welfare checks in Alamogordo before a processing agent noticed Felipe's symptoms at 9 a.m. local time Monday. At all three places where the father and son were detained, they were given food and drinks, as well as showers or personal hygiene products at the last two stations, CBP said.
Felipe's death represents an ""incredibly rare"" tragedy, the federal officials said Wednesday. Six people have died in CBP custody in 2018, Nielsen said.

The second death of a child this month reignited criticism of the federal government’s handling of migrant children and their families.
The incoming chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, offered his condolences to the family and called for an investigation.
""The Administration’s policy of turning people away from legal ports of entry, otherwise known as metering, is putting families and children in great danger,"" Castro said in a statement. ""With two deaths that we know about just in the last few weeks, Congress will continue to press the Department of Homeland Security until we get answers to all our questions.”
Alamogordo, where the boy died, is about 90 miles from the U.S.-Mexican border at El Paso. Ruben Garcia, director of El Paso’s Annunciation House, said Tuesday that he had no reason to believe his shelter had served the family but was waiting for further details about what happened.
A spokeswoman for U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., whose district along the U.S.-Mexican border includes Alamogordo, could not be reached Tuesday.
Xochitl Torres Small, a Democrat who will represent the House district starting in January, called for a thorough and transparent investigation into the children’s deaths and medical resources along the border.
She said she had not personally inspected the holding area at the CBP checkpoint between Las Cruces and Alamogordo, where Felipe was held in between hospital visits. Nonetheless, Torres Small said, she worried that conditions in such facilities ""could be exacerbating illnesses.""
Alluding to overcrowding and hygiene, she said it is critical that CBP determine the best way to transport a sick child, how to ensure availability of medical personnel to give evaluations and how to allow people to take a shower.
The previous migrant child who died in government custody was Jakelin Caal, 7, a Guatemalan girl. She died Dec. 8 in El Paso after being apprehended by border agents.
Jakelin and her father crossed the border in New Mexico on Dec. 6, along with 161 other migrants. They were scheduled to travel by bus to the Lordsburg Border Patrol station in New Mexico when her father, Nery Gilberto Caal, told Border Patrol agents she was sick. She was transported to a children's hospital in El Paso where she died.
The White House said it had no responsibility in the ""horrible, tragic"" situation.
CBP, which did not notify Congress about Jakelin's death for days, said it would follow new procedures when someone dies in its custody. The protocol, including notification of federal lawmakers within 24 hours of any death, was followed after Felipe died, federal officials said Wednesday.
Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., expressed dismay over Tuesday's passing of the 8-year-old boy. In a tweet to Nielsen, Correa wrote, “This is the second child in a month. What is going on at @DHSgov? Does @HouseHomeland have to start subpoenaing you to get the truth?”
Other Democrats responded with criticism of border policies, including Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico.
""Heartbroken and sickened by this news,"" Heinrich said on Twitter. ""I am urgently demanding more details, but the Trump administration must be held accountable for this child’s death and all the lives they have put in danger with their intentional chaos and disregard for human life.""
Several critics said the death was especially troubling during the Christmas holiday season.
""The news of another child death in CBP custody is heartbreaking,"" Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., tweeted. ""We must demand a full and thorough account of what happened to this 8-year-old boy.""
""Tragic news this Christmas Day,"" Rep. Nanette Barragán, D-Calif., remarked on Twitter. ""Another death of a child in CBP custody? This is unacceptable. It is not ok that children are dying, that they are separated from their parents and don’t receive proper medical screenings and treatment. Congress must act. Real oversight coming 1/3.""

2586,Trump warns of a \xe2\x80\x98very long\xe2\x80\x99 government shutdown if Democrats oppose bill that includes border wall money',Washington Post,12/21/2018,,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-leans-on-mcconnell-to-pass-spending-bill-with-border-funding-in-senate/2018/12/21/31bb453a-0517-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html,"The shutdown intensifies a standoff between Trump, who is demanding $5.7 billion for a border wall, and congressional Democrats, who have vowed to block any wall funding and have the votes to do so. It marks a deflating final chapter for Republicans as they complete two years of unified GOP control in Washington — as well as an acrimonious prelude to the upcoming era of divided government, after Democrats take the House in January.

Trump saw the final days of this year as his last chance to try to extract funding for the wall, while Democrats, united against the wall and buttressed by big wins in the midterm elections, showed no signs of buckling to his demands amid a flurry of attacks this week.
The White House and congressional leaders continued negotiations late Friday, but by 8:30 p.m., the House and the Senate had adjourned for the night. That made it impossible to vote on any spending agreement until Saturday, and it remained unclear whether any deal would materialize by then.
It is unclear how long a shutdown might last. Trump predicted earlier Friday that it could drag on for a “very long time.”
AD
About two hours before the shutdown was set to take effect, Trump distributed a video on Twitter in which he blamed Democrats but expressed hope that the lapse in government funding would be brief.

“We’re going to have a shutdown,” he said. “There’s nothing we can do about that because we need the Democrats to give us their votes. . . . Let’s be bipartisan, and let’s get it done. The shutdown hopefully will not last long.”
The Senate on Friday considered legislation to fund the government agencies through Feb. 8 and appropriate $5.7 billion to build 215 miles of wall structures along the Mexico border.
The House passed that legislation Thursday evening, but Senate Democrats successfully unified on Friday and refused to back that measure.
AD
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Friday that Democrats were open to talks with the White House and Republicans but would not agree to any measure that funded the construction of a new border wall.
Schumer said Friday that the Senate had unanimously agreed to a spending bill earlier in the week and accused Trump of having a “temper tantrum” because he wasn’t getting money for the wall.

“President Trump, you will not get your wall,” Schumer said. “You’re not getting your wall today, next week or on Jan. 3 when Democrats take control of the House.”
Democrats tried to make clear to the White House for weeks that they had the votes to block any measure that contained money for the wall.

As their power became clear to White House officials, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders signaled Tuesday that Trump was planning to withdraw his request for the funds in an effort to keep the government open.
But he received a torrent of criticism from conservative lawmakers and commentators following this decision, and he reversed course on Thursday, scuttling a temporary, bipartisan spending bill that would have extended funding through Feb. 8 but did not contain wall money.
Trump on Friday urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to change long-standing Senate rules to pass the House’s measure providing $5.7 billion for the wall. McConnell refused, making it impossible for Senate Republicans to push the measure through because Democrats control 49 seats in the 100-member chamber.

“We’re going to be working very hard to get something passed in the Senate,” Trump said earlier Friday in the Oval Office. “Now it’s up to the Democrats as to whether or not we have a shutdown tonight. I hope we don’t, but we’ve very much prepared for a long shutdown.”
Republicans were frustrated by the reversal, and Democrats warned Friday that the president’s erratic and unvetted decisions in recent days were unsettling financial markets, foreign allies and even members of his Cabinet.
“This is tyranny of talk radio hosts, right? And so, how do you deal with that?” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn). “You have two talk radio hosts who completely flipped the president. And so, do we succumb to tyranny of talk radio hosts?”

Multiple federal parks and monuments are slated to close, some as soon as Saturday morning. The Securities and Exchange Commission posted a list of the services it will soon suspend, including the processing of certain business records. The Justice Department, Commerce Department and Internal Revenue Service are preparing to send thousands of workers home without pay.
And Trump’s prediction that a shutdown would last “for a very long time” meant that hundreds of thousands of federal employees risk missing at least one paycheck. Even the Border Patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration officials who are directed to continue working during the shutdown will not be paid until Congress funds their agencies.

About 400,000 federal workers would be furloughed, according to a Washington Post projection. But a number of federal agencies, including the Pentagon, will not be directly affected, because Congress already passed multiple other spending bills this year that secured funding through September.

As the funding lapse lengthens, the negotiations will prove to be a major test for Trump, Schumer, McConnell and House conservatives as they jostle for footing in Washington’s new power structure.

The construction of a wall along the border with Mexico was one of Trump’s top campaign promises in 2016, and he had promised that Mexico would finance the entire project. But since taking office, he has demanded the money from Congress.
Senate Democrats have blocked every attempt so far. Trump has also threatened to shut the government down numerous times if he doesn’t get money for the border wall, but before Friday night, he had always backed down.
In recent days, Trump has tried a number of different tactics to try to secure the money. He called on Cabinet secretaries to search their budgets for extra funds, and on Wednesday, he said the entire project would be built by the military. But by Thursday he was back to demanding that Congress provide the funding, leaving many GOP lawmakers scrambling to accede to his demands.

The shutdown followed a day of posturing and unsuccessful negotiations in the Senate on Friday.
After meeting with Trump at the White House, McConnell called a vote aimed at advancing the bill with $5.7 billion for the border wall, saying the legislation would not be considered controversial in more normal times.
“I’m proud to vote for it,” McConnell said.
But after hours of maneuvering, it was clear that the legislation would not command the support needed to pass, although the Senate advanced it on a procedural vote — with Pence breaking a tie — to keep a legislative vehicle alive in case a deal does emerge.
Trump, meanwhile, ratcheted up public pressure on Democrats to cave on the wall.
In a spate of morning Twitter posts, Trump sought to pin blame on Democrats for a potential shutdown, even though he said last week that he would accept responsibility for a shutdown.
“The Democrats, whose votes we need in the Senate, will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED,” Trump wrote. “If the Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. People don’t want Open Borders and Crime!”
But Democrats showed no signs of relenting, and on Friday night, they continued to blame Trump and the Republicans for the partial shutdown.
“I think we ought to make it clear that it’s the president’s abrupt change in position and refusal to accept the deal he’s already told his leadership he’d accept,” said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.).
“Look, this is the last week we have a Republican-controlled Senate and House and White House — they’ve got to work this out.”"

Mitch, use the Nuclear Option and get it done! Our Country is counting on you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2018
Trump’s tweet came moments after White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Fox News explicitly that the White House wants the Senate to end the filibuster.
“The Senate has a constitutional duty and a constitutional authority to actually protect our country. We can’t be a sovereign country if we don’t have borders and we don’t have protection of the American citizens,” Sanders declared.
Trump’s tweet is the latest in a series he sent Friday morning urging the Senate to pass a bill which cleared the House of Representatives Thursday night, and fully provides 5 billion dollars for his proposed wall along the U.S. southern border.

Shutdown today if Democrats do not vote for Border Security! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2018
No matter what happens today in the Senate, Republican House Members should be very proud of themselves. They flew back to Washington from all parts of the World in order to vote for Border Security and the Wall. Not one Democrat voted yes, and we won big. I am very proud of you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2018
This option was originally thought to be untenable in the Senate because it could not garner the necessary 60 votes. All legislation that passes the upper chamber of Congress must have 60 votes of support in order to clear a filibuster-proof majority. The Senate, however, reserves the ability to remake its own rules and end the historical filibuster.
Trump’s instruction for McConnell may, however, fall on deaf ears with the senate leader promising in 2017 that he would never end the filibuster in order to advance legislation.
“There’s not a single senator in the majority who thinks we ought to change the legislative filibuster,” McConnell declared in 2017. “Not one.”"
2114,"Trump demands wall funding, increasing threat of U.S. government shutdown'",Reuters,12/20/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-budget/trump-balks-at-government-funding-bill-raising-shutdown-fears-idUSKCN1OJ188,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday added $5 billion to a government spending bill to help President Donald Trump make good on a pledge to build a border wall, a move that made a partial federal government shutdown more likely this weekend.
The Senate is highly unlikely to pass the legislation, which funds agencies responsible for federal law enforcement activities, airport security screenings, space exploration and farm programs, by a midnight deadline on Friday.
Trump had said he would not sign a Senate-passed bill to keep the government running through Feb. 8 because it lacked funds for the wall, a signature promise of his 2016 run for office, so Republicans in the House of Representatives scrambled to add money to appease the president.
Trump demanded $5 billion to put toward a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico that he argues is needed to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, a down payment on a massive project which Democrats have rejected as ineffective and wasteful.
“The bill that’s on the floor of the House, everyone knows will not pass the Senate,” Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters ahead of the vote.
The funding uncertainty weighed on markets on Thursday but it was later dwarfed by another bombshell from the Trump administration: the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
Trump, who accused Democrats of playing politics with the border wall, has said he sees it as a winning issue for his 2020 re-election campaign. Last week in a White House meeting with Democratic congressional leaders, he said he would be “proud to shut down the government for border security.”
“I’ve made my position very clear. Any measure that funds the government must include border security,” Trump said at a White House event.

The House-passed bill also includes $7.8 billion in aid for states hit by recent natural disasters.
The Senate had approved a bill late Wednesday that extended existing funds for agencies for seven weeks, punting the funding issue into the next Congress.
But hard-right conservative pundits and lawmakers urged Trump to push for border wall funding now, even if it leads to a shutdown, arguing that it would be impossible to get once Democrats take control of the House on Jan. 3.
“It’s really about a president that is not willing to fold without a fight,” Republican Representative Mark Meadows said in an interview on Fox News.
The Senate will look at the House-passed bill on Friday afternoon but would need support from Democrats to vote quickly on it. Most senators had already left Washington for the Christmas break.

Trump also had planned to leave for a vacation at his private resort in Florida, but the White House said he would not go in the event of a shutdown.
During his 2016 campaign, Trump repeatedly said Mexico would pay for the border wall but never specified how. Last week he said that a new trade deal his administration had negotiated with Mexico and Canada would generate enough savings to be equivalent to Mexico financing the wall.
The issue of money for the wall also led to a partial government shutdown during a weekend in January, and a second funding gap in February lasted only a few hours. Impact on government services was negligible in both cases.
In a 2013 shutdown, conservative Republicans made an unsuccessful effort to use funding bills to repeal President Barack Obama’s healthcare law."

The Democrats aren’t going to get away with holding the federal government hostage to their radical open-borders agenda. Not again.
The Democrats know that they got the Republicans to cave during the previous budget impasse, which produced a bloated $1.3 trillion Omnibus spending bill that didn’t fund construction of the border wall. President Trump reluctantly signed that bill, but he did so with a vow that he would never again put his signature on such a bad piece of legislation.
“As a matter of National Security I've signed the Omnibus Spending Bill. I say to Congress: I will NEVER sign another bill like this again,” the President declared in March. “To prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all govt spending bills!”
He made his position even more clear in July, pledging to fix the country’s broken immigration system even if it requires a shutdown.
“I don’t care what the political ramifications are, our immigration laws and border security have been a complete and total disaster for decades, and there is no way that the Democrats will allow it to be fixed without a Government Shutdown,” he tweeted. “Border Security is National Security, and National Security is the long-term viability of our Country. A Government Shutdown is a very small price to pay for a safe and Prosperous America!”
Prior to the last budget impasse, President Trump offered congressional Democrats a surprisingly generous deal, offering to accept legal status for nearly a million DACA recipients in exchange for funding of the border wall. True to form, though, the obstructionist Democrats rejected the President’s good-faith overture, even though the $5 billion he requested for the wall would have accounted for less than 0.004 percent of the amount Congress ended up appropriating.
Now, with a partial government shutdown looming if a deal to fund seven government agencies can’t be concluded by December 21, President Trump has a perfect opportunity to follow through on his pledge while finally getting the border wall funding he has sought since the beginning of his presidency.
Senate Democrats insist that they will not accept more than $1.6 billion for border security, and they’re threatening to punish the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), if the President doesn’t capitulate.
In order to get their way, the Democrats will do everything in their power to portray a potential partial government shutdown as a national catastrophe, but that’s just more fearmongering intended to manipulate the public and the press.
In reality, about two-thirds of the federal government is already funded through a budget deal reached earlier in the year, so a partial shutdown would not affect most federal employees, including those serving in the armed forces. In fact, it’s entirely possible that the showdown will only involve DHS funding because of the political drama over immigration, since Congress could fund the other six agencies separately.
Even if DHS were temporarily left without funding, though, it would not materially impact border security, because Border Patrol and ICE agents would almost certainly still be required to report for work. They would not be able to receive paychecks until a funding deal could be reached, but history shows that this would only be a temporary problem, since Congress has always appropriated back pay for employees affected by previous shutdowns.
The Democrats are a party of con artists and fear mongers, but President Trump is no fool. He knows that a border wall is essential to our national security, and he’s not going to give up on that urgent priority in the interest of political expediency.

6412,The House is scrambling to avoid a partial shutdown after Trump throws negotiations into chaos',Vox,12/20/2018,,,https://www.vox.com/2018/12/20/18150263/house-republicans-trump-border-wall-government-shutdown,"With the Senate rejecting a House spending bill that included money for President Trump’s border wall, the federal government looks headed for a shutdown at midnight.
The Senate declined to even vote on a short-term spending package containing $5 billion of wall funding that the House passed Thursday, knowing it could not get the 60 votes needed. President Donald Trump’s sudden refusal to sign anything without wall funding has thrown Congress into a tailspin with just hours to go until a shutdown.
The president sent a series of confrontational tweets on Friday morning urging Mitch McConnell to hold a vote on a funding bill sure to fail. Then he urged the Senate Majority Leader to “go nuclear” and abandon Senate rules to get it done, an idea McConnell rejected.
At issue is Trump’s red line on $5 billion for a border wall, something Democrats universally oppose. The Republican-controlled House passed a bill that includes the $5 billion, but the Senate, which needs Democrats and Republicans to pass anything needing 60 votes, is set to reject it. The Senate has already passed a bipartisan “clean” bill to fund the government into February — without the border money attached.
Democrats take control of the House in less than two weeks, after which it would be much harder for Trump to get his money approved.
Trump had previously supported the clean-bill plan, but did an about-face on Thursday after pressure from conservatives. With no clear direction on what Trump would be willing to sign, Congressional leaders are essentially going back to the drawing board.
“There is no path forward for the House bill,” Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) said on the Senate floor Friday night. “What I wanted to do with not proceeding is demonstrate that not all Republicans would be for the House bill either.”
Republican and Democratic leaders of both chambers will now have to hash out a deal with Trump, the person who created the two-day long crisis by going back on his word that he would sign a short-term spending bill even if it didn’t contain funding for his wall. Trump is staying in DC for the holidays, but we don’t yet know how long these negotiations will take.
What we do know is the government is definitely shutting down — at least for some period of time.
What happened Friday
On Friday afternoon, the Senate voted on a motion on whether to take up the House bill including the $5 billion in funding for Trump’s border wall. But they never made it to the final vote.
Senators of both parties spent Friday scrambling to find a solution to the impasse. At one point, Vice President Mike Pence, incoming Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and senior adviser Jared Kushner paid a visit to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and then to House Republicans to try to strike a deal. Ultimately, it was to no avail.
The Senate passed a short-term spending bill on Wednesday which kept border security funding at current levels, but the House passed a different version that added in the $5 billion in border wall funding the president wanted.
Trump had seemed to be willing to sign the Senate’s “clean” spending bill earlier this week, but sharply changed course. The result is that parts of the government are set to shut down at midnight unless there is a dramatic breakthrough. (This bill impacts 25 percent of the government, the other 75 percent is already funded.)
On Friday morning, Trump blamed Democrats for the potential government shutdown and said it could “last for a very long time.”
The Democrats, whose votes we need in the Senate, will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED. If the Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. People don’t want Open Borders and Crime! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2018
The president’s focus on Senate passage of the border wall money has even prompted him to call on the upper chamber to use the “nuclear option,” which would blow up Senate rules so that the spending bill would only require a simple majority to pass, instead of the current 60 votes that it needs. (Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already rejected this idea.)
How this could end
The working assumption that if the government shuts down, it will one day reopen.
At the very least, Democrats will retake the House in January and could pass a new version of the clean Senate bill, which Trump would be forced to sign or veto.
Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (who is poised to become the next speaker) have made it clear they won’t agree to $5 billion of border wall funding. The question now is whether they will consider a lower sum for border security, potentially in exchange for a deal on immigration reform.
Right now, the number being thrown around is $1.6 billion in border security, but negotiations will likely keep going tonight and possibly through the weekend.
Because whatever bill comes up to the Senate needs 60 votes, which means some Democrats need to support it. Democrats know they have leverage here, and they will surely demand some concessions (like they have in the past regarding protections for DACA recipients) in exchange.
And Trump has motivation to get this done before January 3, when the House will change hands and a new Democratic majority that will not cater to his whims takes power.
What will be open and closed during a shutdown
Since roughly three-quarters of the government has been funded by existing bills, many services are set to remain intact in the case of a partial shutdown. Other programs that have been classified as “essential” will keep running as well, although some government entities like museums could see wholesale closures.
Hundreds of thousands of government employees could also be furloughed for the duration of the shutdown, though they would likely receive back pay after the fact. Here’s a list of what will and won’t be affected:
What’s still running
Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid
Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are all slated to keep up their operations uninterrupted. All three programs fall under “mandatory spending” that the federal government has committed to and are not affected by the annual appropriations process. (Medicaid also relies, in part, on state spending.)
New applicants for these programs might face a wait, however.
The US Postal Service
Post offices will remain operational and mail delivery will continue. As Rachel Wolfe has written for Vox, the USPS is funded by independent sources of revenue, including the sales of products and services — so it’s not impacted by any kind of shutdown.
Veterans hospitals and benefits
The Department of Veterans Affairs has already secured its funding, so veterans hospitals will maintain their routine operations.
Veteran disability pay and GI Bill benefits are funded by their own legislation separate from the annual appropriations bills, so those would stay consistent, according to Military.com.
Food stamps
People will still be able to get food stamps and subsidized lunches, at least in the short term. But it depends on how long the shutdown lasts: In the past, the Department of Agriculture has only had limited funding to maintain them without newly approved appropriations.
The military
Active-duty members of the military are exempt from shutdown furloughs, according to a contingency plan for the Department of Homeland Security. In the past, Congress has needed to pass separate legislation to ensure that members of the military are paid in a timely fashion during shutdowns. Otherwise they could potentially see delays in their pay depending on if the shutdown extends past a certain payment cycle.
The Mueller investigation
While special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference and the Trump campaign is under the purview of the Department of Justice, it will not be affected by any appropriations stalemate since it has its own permanent source of funding, CNN reports.
Border Patrol
Border security is at the heart of the shutdown fight, and a key chunk of the staffing for it is on track to remain intact even in the face of a partial shutdown involving DHS funding. US Customs and Border Protection is classified as an “essential” service, so a majority of its employees are exempt from furloughs during the shutdown — though they could encounter lags in pay.
As Bloomberg reports, “the overwhelming majority of border patrol, emergency management and immigration enforcement staff would be able to keep doing their jobs, though with their pay delayed.”
Air traffic control and TSA
Air traffic controllers, who fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Aviation Administration (which is under the Transportation Department umbrella), are deemed “essential” and will keep working during a partial shutdown.
Similarly, Transportation Service Administration agents are also considered “essential,” so airline travel is not expected to see disruptions on this front, according to USA Today.
The federal judiciary
The judiciary is able to maintain operations for a short period of time after funding runs out by using money it’s gathered from various courts-related fees including “funds derived from court filings,” according to the Congressional Research Service.
In 2018, the judiciary said it had the wherewithal to keep its operations open for about three weeks, notes CRS.
Washington, DC
The city now has more autonomy over its budget and should be able to maintain most of its services, despite ties to federal appropriations.
During the 2013 shutdown, city officials had to scramble to ensure that DC had the money it needed to remain operational, but since then, Congress has approved measures to insulate the impact on the city in the event of a shutdown.
What could be affected by a partial shutdown
Every agency has its own contingency plan set up in case of a shutdown, and there are a couple of key bodies, including the IRS and National Parks, that could see some pauses or breaks in service. Additionally, as MarketWatch points out, the president has the ability to determine whether any service is “essential” or not — so it’s possible he could try to shut down a key government function like air traffic control if he really wanted to make a point.
National parks
National parks, which are funded as part of the Interior Department, have long been one of the most visible government entities affected by a shutdown and that could happen again this time around. During last January’s shutdown, many national parks were still open to visitors, but they had limited staffing and closed access to various park facilities, including restrooms. It’s possible we could see a repeat of this arrangement.
Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo have previously been closed during shutdowns and would likely be shuttered again since they derive their funding from the Interior Department.
The IRS
A key body under the Treasury Department, the IRS has indicated that it plans to furlough a significant fraction of its workers under a contingency plan, since tax season has yet to get underway.
State Department services
People will still be able to obtain passports and visas, although the State Department could stop issuing them if those services are offered in buildings run by another agency that is shut down, Bloomberg reports.

5406,Stephen Miller says Trump is \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely\xe2\x80\x9d willing to shut down the government over border wall funding',Vox,12/17/2018,,,https://www.vox.com/2018/12/16/18143347/stephen-miller-trump-government-shutdown-border-wall-funding,"The Trump administration has continued its public fight over the border wall, with White House senior adviser Stephen Miller telling CBS that President Donald Trump is “absolutely” willing to shut down the government on December 21 if Congress refuses to authorize funding for his wall.
Echoing Trump’s own sentiments from Tuesday’s fiery Oval Office debate, Miller told CBS’s Margaret Brennan on Sunday’s Face the Nation that Trump would do “whatever is necessary” — including allowing a partial government shutdown.
“If it comes to it, absolutely. This is a very fundamental issue,” he said. “At stake is the question of whether or not the United States remains a sovereign country. Whether or not we can establish and enforce rules for entrance into our country.”
Miller’s comments come after a very tense, very public week of funding negotiations: A televised White House meeting between Trump, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Tuesday ended with the president saying he would be “proud” to shut down the government over their refusal to allocate $5 billion in wall funding (the total cost of the wall ranges from $20 billion to $70 billion). “If we don’t get what we want one way or another. ... I will shut down the government,” Trump said.
Schumer held equally firm on NBC’s Meet the Press Sunday, telling Chuck Todd that Trump is “not going to get the wall in any form.”
“We should not let a temper tantrum, threats, push us in the direction of doing something even our Republicans colleagues know is wrong,” the New York Democrat said.
On Face the Nation, Miller implied that refusing to fund the border wall was the same thing as advocating for illegal immigration, saying that Democrats have “a simple choice” between fighting for America’s working class and promoting illegal immigration. There is already $1.6 billion proposed for border security funding — it’s just a number on which Democrats seem unwilling to budge.
Will the government shut down over a couple billion in wall funding?
Trump has already signed a number of government spending bills into law. But Congress is staring down another partial government shutdown deadline on December 21: Seven department spending bills still need to be voted on, and funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which has purview over construction projects on the border, has proven to be the major sticking point.
Democrats have been unwilling to meet Trump’s $5 billion border wall demands, while Trump has been unwilling to offer them anything — other than not shutting down the government.
It’s not the first time Trump has threatened to shut down the government over his border wall — he also threatened a shutdown over summer, although that never went ahead. This shutdown would be the third under Trump; previous shutdowns occurred because Democrats wanted to force a larger Senate debate on immigration and because Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) was mad about government spending.
It’s not clear if the president and his emissaries are serious or simply posturing this time around.
The Trump administration has been threatening this shutdown for a while now, with White House counselor Kellyanne Conway telling Fox & Friends last month that Trump “is keeping all options open,” when asked about the possibility of a shutdown.
But as Ezra Klein pointed out after the Trump-Pelosi-Schumer showdown, Trump doesn’t actually want the wall as much as he wants a reality show-style fight over it:
[I]t’s the winning, not the wall, that drives him. It’s showing his supporters he’s fighting for them that powers his presidency, not actually getting anything done. Tuesday’s Oval Office meeting was meant to give Trump what he at least thinks he wants — not the wall, but a fight over the wall.
The White House chose to send Miller, a hardline immigration opponent, out to talk on Sunday — and he delivered a hard line (plus some good television)."
4635,"Americans' message to Washington on the looming shutdown: Don't""",USA TODAY,12/17/2018,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/17/poll-americans-blame-trump-gop-shutdown-over-wall-dispute/2334326002/,"WASHINGTON – Americans have a clear message to Washington as the government hurtles toward a partial shutdown Friday: Don't.
By a double-digit margin, 54 percent to 29 percent, those surveyed in a new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll say they oppose the shutdown that President Donald Trump threatened if Congress doesn't agree to his demand for $5 billion in funding for a border wall.
Who would bear the blame?
By nearly 2-1, Americans would blame Trump and the Republicans, not congressional Democrats. Forty-three percent would blame the president and the GOP, while 24 percent would hold congressional Democrats responsible. Thirty percent would blame both sides equally.
""Completely, it's Donald Trump's fault,"" says Dave Dobrin, 60, a retired computer programmer from Orange County, California, who was among those surveyed. A political independent, he voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. ""He has the emotional maturity of a 6-year-old, and he is going to have a tantrum if he doesn't get his way.""
Dwayne Pyle, 33, a Republican who voted for Trump, says the need for a wall to secure the southern border is crucial, and he blames Democrats for refusing to cooperate with the president. ""We hired him to do a job,"" says Pyle of Redding, California, who works in sewer-line maintenance. ""We didn't hire him to make everybody happy or appease people.""

There is, unsurprisingly, a sharp partisan divide in attitudes toward the shutdown.
Democrats are almost all opposed to it, 83 percent to 6 percent. Independents are also overwhelmingly against the idea, 56 percent to 22 percent. Two-thirds of Republicans support a shutdown; one in five oppose it.
The blame game also has a partisan cast.
Democrats (81 percent of them) place the blame on Republicans. Republicans (58 percent of them) place the blame on Democrats. Independents (43 percent of them) place more blame on both parties equally than on either individually.
The nationwide survey of 1,000 registered voters, taken by landline and cellphone Tuesday through Sunday, has a margin of error of +/-3 percentage points.
The partial shutdown, which would begin three days before Christmas, would be the third since Trump took office two years ago.

There seems to be no clear plan to avoid the shutdown that looms at midnight Friday for the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies. Trump declared at a White House meeting with Democratic congressional leaders last week that he would be ""proud"" to take responsibility for shutting down the government if Congress refused to approve the funding he wants for a wall.

That proposal almost certainly can't command the 60 votes it would need to pass the Senate. Even approval in the Republican-controlled House isn't assured.
Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called on Republicans to persuade Trump to back down. ""They just have to have the guts to tell President Trump he's off the deep end here and all he is going to get with his temper tantrum is a shutdown,"" Schumer said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""He will not get a wall.""
Stephen Miller, a senior White House aide, showed no signs of compromise. ""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" he said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Including a shutdown? ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

2200,"Dems defy Trump shutdown threat: 'He is not going to get the wall in any form'""",Washington Times,12/17/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/dec/16/chuck-schumer-democrats-defy-trump-government-shut/,"Democrats dug in their heels Sunday on President Trump’s threat to shut down the government unless he gets money for his border wall, saying if the president makes good on his demand, the American people will suffer.
But the White House contends American citizens are already suffering — with or without a shutdown — because of the rise in illegal immigration.
The two sides showed no sign of willingness to compromise Sunday, with just four days left to broker an agreement before the federal government partially shuts down.
“We should not let a temper tantrum — threats — push us in the direction of doing something even our Republican colleagues know is wrong,” Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer told NBC.
The New York Democrat said Republicans in Congress “have to have the guts” to tell the president he’s wrong for refusing to fund the government unless he gets $5 billion for his border wall.
“President Trump should understand there are not the votes for the wall in the House or the Senate. He is not going to get the wall in any form,” he said.
And the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Rep. Elijah Cummings, Maryland Democrat, said voters want the government to help them, not hurt them, suggesting a shutdown will politically damage Republicans.
“Whenever I hear a president say to the American people at Christmastime, ‘I am going to shut down your government,’ it pains me because I know it’s going to make a bad Christmas for a lot of people,” he told CNN.
But White House adviser Stephen Miller said Mr. Trump will do “whatever is necessary” to get the money to build the border wall.
“They can either choose to fight for Americans — working class — or to promote illegal immigration. You can’t do both,” Mr. Miller said of Democrats in an interview Sunday with CBS.
Congress is running up against a Friday deadline to finish funding the government, with several news reports suggesting they may look to a short-term “continuing resolution” that funds the government at current levels to get them past the holidays and into the new year.
Sen. Susan Collins, Maine Republican, told ABC she wants to see lawmakers take up a proposal that provided $2.5 billion this year and over the next 10 years for border security, which would fund a border fence, increase technology and patrol agents along the southern border.
“There is absolutely no excuse to shut down government on this issue or any issue. I have suggested we revisit a compromise proposal we brought forward earlier this year,” she said on Sunday, breaking with her party’s leader.
House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Mr. Schumer have offered Mr. Trump two other options, and they both include some money — roughly $1.3 billion — for the wall.
But it remains unclear whether the president will accept any compromise after his televised stand off with the two Democratic leaders in the Oval Office last week, where he demanded the $5 billion and claimed he isn’t afraid to shut down the government.
“I am proud to shut down the government for border security,” Mr. Trump said.

4219,Trump Throws Down With Pelosi and Schumer Over Border Wall: \xe2\x80\x98I Am Proud to Shut Down the Government\xe2\x80\x99',Daily Beast,12/11/2018,,,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-schumer-pelosi-devolve-into-shouting-match-during-oval-office-meeting,"President Donald Trump threatened to shut down the government during a heated argument with Democratic congressional leaders in the Oval Office on Tuesday in a remarkable display of partisan bickering just 10 days before a partial shutdown is set to take effect.
“I am proud to shut down the government for border security,” Trump said bluntly. “I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I’m not going to blame you for it. The last time you shut it down, it didn’t work. I will take the mantle of shutting down. And I’m going to shut it down for border security.”
The remark came during an extraordinary 15-minute on-camera argument that began with Trump insisting that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) should help him fund a border wall. Trump has asked for $5 billion in border-security funding, but Democrats have said $1.6 billion is their red line.
At first, both leaders sat silently listening to Trump read dubious figures and repeat falsehoods about how much of the wall has already been built. When Pelosi reminded the president that he does not have enough votes in the House to fund it, the president pivoted and began boasting about his party’s electoral gains in the Senate.
“When the president brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he’s in real trouble,” Schumer said with a laugh.
“I did!” Trump shot back.
An exasperated Pelosi repeated to Trump that he does not have enough votes among House Republicans alone to fully fund a border wall, and Trump responded by saying he needs 60 votes in the Senate, where Republicans have just a 51-to-49 majority, to get anything to his desk.
“The fact is, you do not have the votes in the House,” Pelosi said, to which Trump insisted: “Nancy, I do.”
Schumer then confronted Trump directly over his exaggerations and mistruths about the border wall.
“We have a lot of disagreements here. The Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of Pinocchios because they say you constantly misstate how much of the wall is built,” a defiant Schumer said. “You have called 20 times to shut down the government. You say, ‘I want to shut down the government.’ We don’t. We want to come to an agreement.”
At one point, Trump jabbed at Pelosi, saying, “Nancy’s in a situation where it’s not easy for her to talk right now.”
Pelosi fired back immediately, telling the president, “Please don’t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as leader of the House Democrats who just won a big victory.”
After the meeting, Schumer vented about the president’s tone during the sit-down. “This temper tantrum that he seems to throw will not get him his wall,” he said.
The partisan jabbing, which came during a photo opportunity before Trump was set to negotiate with Pelosi and Schumer behind closed doors, represented a preview of what to expect with a divided government next year, when Democrats officially take control of the House of Representatives.
“Unfortunately, this has spiraled downward when we came at a place to say, how do we meet the needs of the American people,” Pelosi said.
During the tense exchanges, Vice President Mike Pence sat stoically next to Trump and remained silent.
After the meeting, some Republicans began rallying behind the president. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a Trump ally, tweeted, “Great job sticking to your guns on border security, Mr. President! You are right to want more border security funding including Wall money. They are WRONG to say no.”"
3974,"Trump feuds openly with Pelosi, Schumer as border fight explodes in White House'",Washington Examiner,12/11/2018,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-feuds-openly-with-pelosi-schumer-as-border-fight-explodes-in-white-house,"President Trump's battle with Democrats to fund a border wall spilled out into public view on Tuesday, as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., challenged Trump's request for more border funding and Trump argued back that Americans are demanding a barrier to keep out illegal immigrants.
The 15-minute meeting between the political opponents started cordially, but it ran off the rails after Pelosi warned that Trump's hard-line position on the wall would lead to a ""Trump shutdown.""
""I think the American people recognize that we must keep the government open, that a shutdown is not worth anything,"" Pelosi told Trump in the Oval Office Tuesday. ""And that you should not have a 'Trump shutdown.'""
""A what? Did you say a 'Trump shutdown?'"" Trump asked Pelosi.
""You have the White House. You have the Senate. You have the House of Representatives. You have the votes. You should pass it [a government funding bill] right now,"" Pelosi said.
""I can't get it passed in the House if it is not going to pass in the Senate,"" Trump fired back. ""The House we can get passed very easily. ... The problem is the Senate. We need 10 Democrats to vote and they aren't going to do it.""
Pelosi said that House Republicans don't have the votes to pass a bill that both funds the government and provides funding for the border wall. Pelosi argued that if they did, they would put such a bill on the floor.
""There are not votes — a majority of votes — for a wall,"" Pelosi told Trump.
""That's exactly right,"" Schumer echoed.
""If I needed the votes for the wall in the House, I would have them in one session. It would be done,"" Trump replied. ""It doesn't help to take that vote. I need 10 senators. That is the problem. ... We need the wall. More importantly, we need border security of which the wall is just a piece.""
Trump then offered the floor to Schumer, who immediately pointed out that the president has made some misleading statements about the wall.
""The Washington Post today gave you a whole lot of Pinochios because they say you constantly misstate how much of the wall is built,"" Schumer said in his opening remarks. He also said Trump doesn't want an agreement, but simply wants to shut down the government.
""We have a disagreement about the wall,"" Schumer said. ""We do not want to shutdown the government. You have called 20 times to shut down the government ... We don't. We want to come to an agreement.""
Pelosi at one point lamented that the meeting had turned into a public feud, and asked the the rest of the discussion be held without being observed by the press.
""Unfortunately, this has spiraled downward,"" says Nancy Pelosi during a heated argument with President Trump at the Oval Office. pic.twitter.com/bZrjiNLOmK — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) December 11, 2018
But the president instead took questions. In response to one question, Trump argued the wall is inextricably linked to his border security plans.
""You can't have good border security without the wall,"" Trump said.
""That is just not true,"" Pelosi interrupted as Schumer shook his head in approval of her retort.
""That is a political promise,"" Pelosi said of the wall. ""Border security is a way to effectively honor our responsibility.""
""We have to find a way to do border security without a wall, which is wasteful and doesn't solve the problem,"" Schumer added.
""It totally solves the problem and it is very important,"" Trump replied.
Trump ended the public part of the negotiation by saying he would be happy to shut down the government if it means he can secure funding for ""border security.""
""We need border security. That is what we are talking about border security,"" the president said towards the end of the argument. ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security.""
The president is asking Congress to approve $5 billion in border wall funding before both chambers head home for Christmas. House and Senate Democrats are unwilling to give the president any more than $1.6 billion for the border wall, a disagreement that has raised fears of a possible partial government shutdown. Trump scheduled a meeting Tuesday with Schumer and Pelosi to work out a solution that would both fund the government and his border wall."
5449,"Trump, top Democrats clash on border wall in rare Oval Office fight'",Reuters,12/11/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-congress/trump-top-democrats-clash-on-border-wall-in-rare-oval-office-fight-idUSKBN1OA1CF,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump openly fought with the top two Democratic lawmakers in the Oval Office on Tuesday about government funding, throwing into question whether a deal to avert a government shutdown was possible ahead of a deadline next week.
In a remarkable public argument, the likes of which is seldom seen before cameras, Trump brawled with U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi about paying for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border that they see as ineffective and wasteful.
“If we don’t get what we want, one way or the other - whether it’s through you, through a military, through anything you want to call - I will shut down the government,” Trump said as the heated argument drew to a crescendo.
“I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don’t want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country,” he said before reporters left their ringside seats.
Vice President Mike Pence sat beside Trump, silent and stone faced.
While Trump’s fellow Republicans control both the House and the Senate until next month, Democratic support is needed to pass any spending legislation.
If the impasse cannot be resolved by Dec. 21, about one-quarter of the federal government immediately would be left without funding. Money for the rest of the government already has been appropriated.
Trump has asked Congress for $5 billion for border security, while Schumer and Pelosi have offered to extend funding at current levels, around $1.3 billion. That is less than the $1.6 billion a bipartisan Senate committee approved.
While the battle over border security is contentious, the money being negotiated is a small portion of a $450 billion bill to keep agencies operating through next September.
In an interview with Reuters later in the day, Trump did not rule out a compromise on the funding. “We have to see what else is entailed,” he said.
HARSH WORDS CONTINUED
The meeting did not last long after reporters were ushered out of the Oval Office.
But the harsh words continued during a closed meeting of House Democrats. According to an aide in the room, Pelosi said Trump’s fixation with building a wall was “like a manhood thing for him. As if manhood could ever be associated with him.”
Pelosi told reporters she had asked Trump to pray about resolving the dispute, recounting the biblical story of King Solomon asking God for wisdom.
Pelosi told reporters that later in the day that she and Trump spoke by telephone, and the president said he was reviewing the offer made by Democrats during the White House meeting.
Despite the rancor, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, told reporters, “I’d still like to see a smooth ending here and I haven’t given up hope that’s what we’ll have.”

If there is no deal, Trump would be shuttering the very agency in charge of border security - the Department of Homeland Security. In past shutdown battles, workers deemed “essential” were instructed to work.
Other federal agencies that also would face closures include the departments of State, Commerce and Agriculture, and visitors would not be allowed into federal parks.
At the Pentagon, Lieutenant Colonel Jamie Davis said there were no plans now for the U.S. military to build sections of the border wall, though the Defense Department could under current law pay for some border barrier projects “such as in support of counter-drug operations or national emergencies.”
‘IT’S CALLED TRANSPARENCY’
The rocky White House meeting was the first Trump held with Pelosi and Schumer since Democrats won control of the House in Nov. 6 elections, possibly foreshadowing battles to come next year.
Trump told Reuters he thought it would be possible to work on legislation with Democrats - unless they launch a barrage of investigations into his administration and policies.
“We’re either going to start the campaign and they’re going to do presidential harassment. Or we’re going to get tremendous amounts of legislation passed working together,” he said.
Tuesday’s fight kicked off when Pelosi told Trump that Americans did not want to see a “Trump shutdown,” touching a nerve. Trump cut off Pelosi, arguing that he could not advance a funding bill without Democratic votes in the Senate.
“If I needed the votes for the wall in the House, I would have them in one session. It would be done,” Trump bragged.

“Well then - go do it, go do it,” Pelosi shot back.
Senior White House staff watched the melee from the edges of the room.
“I don’t think we should have a debate in front of the press on this,” Pelosi said, adding, “Let’s call a halt to this.”
“It’s not bad, Nancy - it’s called transparency,” Trump said."

“People do not yet realize how much of the Wall, including really effective renovation, has already been built. If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall. They know how important it is!” Trump vowed, capping a series of tweets meant to set the stage for the White House summit.
For their part, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer put out a joint statement Monday arguing Trump and his party will own a government shutdown if they can’t strike a deal.
""Republicans still control the House, the Senate and the White House, and they have the power to keep government open,"" they said. ""Our country cannot afford a Trump Shutdown,"" the Democrats said, adding that Trump ""knows full well that his wall proposal does not have the votes to pass the House and Senate and should not be an obstacle to a bipartisan agreement.""
Congress last week temporarily averted a partial shutdown amid the funeral services for the late President George H.W. Bush, pushing the new deadline to Dec. 21. Trump was meeting at the White House Tuesday with Pelosi and Schumer to discuss a new government spending package – with border wall funding the biggest sticking point. The Democratic leaders arrived at the White House shortly before noon.
Trump wants $5 billion for the project, while Democrats are offering $1.3 billion for border security.
The president earlier this year pushed for military funding to finance the border project. But while administrations can move some money around in their budgets, they need approval from Congress – and the relevant appropriations bills for fiscal 2019 did not include money for this purpose.
Top Democrats also warned earlier this year that the Pentagon would not have the power to redirect funding to the border wall.
But Trump’s tweets marked the latest effort on both sides to project a strong negotiating position.
The president also claimed that the wall and fencing already in place helped turn back the migrant caravans forming in Mexico. He accused Democrats of sacrificing border security for political reasons, even suggesting Pelosi is holding up funding for a border wall in order to secure votes for the speakership in the next Congress.
“We have already built large new sections & fully renovated others, making them like new. The Democrats … however, for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left, do NOT want Border Security. They want Open Borders for anyone to come in. This brings large scale crime and disease,” he tweeted.
“Our Southern Border is now Secure and will remain that way … I look forward to my meeting with Chuck Schumer & Nancy Pelosi. In 2006, Democrats voted for a Wall, and they were right to do so. Today, they no longer want Border Security. They will fight it at all cost, and Nancy must get votes for Speaker. But the Wall will get built.”
Pelosi does face pressure from her base not to bend on the border wall funding fight. But more than the speaker’s gavel is at stake – Democratic votes in both the House and Senate could be critical for averting a partial shutdown.
Sixty votes are required in the Senate to overcome a filibuster. And, at least for the near-term, Republicans only have 51 members.
Republicans for the rest of the month have a comfortable majority in the House, but lack the votes on their side alone to pass a bill with or without wall money.
Pelosi and Schumer have urged Trump to support a bill that includes a half-dozen government funding bills largely agreed upon by lawmakers, along with a separate measure that funds the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Sept. 30.
Democrats will likely push for a continuing resolution that funds the remaining appropriations bills if Trump doesn't agree to that, an aide told The Associated Press.
Trump said Friday that Congress should provide all the money he wants for the wall and called illegal immigration a ""threat to the well-being of every American community.""
Pelosi said she and many other Democrats consider the wall ""immoral, ineffective and expensive.""
Schumer said Democrats want to work with Trump to avert a shutdown, but said money for border security should not include the concrete wall Trump has envisioned. Instead, the money should be used for fencing and technology that experts say is appropriate, Schumer said.
""We do not want to let a Trump temper tantrum govern our policies or cause the shutdown of a government, which everyone on both sides of the aisle knows is the wrong idea,"" Schumer said. If Trump ""wants to shut down the government over Christmas over the wall, that's his decision,"" he said.
But House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., said Democrats were the ones playing politics.
Trump ""wants to secure the border. He got elected president on that platform,"" Scalise told Fox News.
If there's a better way to secure the border than the $5 billion plan Trump has laid out, Democrats ""need to come with an alternative,"" Scalise said Monday.

President Donald Trump clashed sharply with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer in a remarkable Oval Office meeting before reporters Tuesday, with the president threatening to shut down the government and the Democrats warning him they will not bend.
In a pitched partisan argument televised for all to see, the GOP president and the House and Senate Democratic leaders traded barbs over Trump’s border wall during what was supposed to be a private negotiating session to keep a large swath of the government from shuttering after Dec. 21.

And in perhaps his most definitive statement yet, Trump said he would be “proud” to preside over a partial shutdown if that’s what it takes to get his campaign promise fulfilled.
Democrats urged the president against such a stance, even as they seized on the chance to blame Trump for any potential shutdown.
“We shouldn’t shut down the government over a dispute,” said Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader.

“The last time, Chuck, you shut it down,” shot back Trump, referring to Democrats’ brief shut down over immigration earlier this year. “If we don’t get what we want … I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck.”
The public battle revealed the yawning gap between the president and congressional Democrats, foreshadowing the next 10 days of dramatic back-and-forth over whether roughly a quarter of the government will lapse due to the president’s $5 billion border wall request. It seems both parties have little incentive to give in: the Democratic grassroots doesn’t want a compromise with Trump, and the president sees no reason to give up now that the midterms are over.
Republicans are already grappling with the fallout. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said bluntly: ""I hope that's not where we end up.""
""I understand it was a rather spirited meeting. But I feel like I see a smooth ending here. I haven't given up hope,"" McConnell said after a GOP lunch with Vice President Mike Pence.
After the meeting, Schumer said that Trump had a ""temper tantrum"" and Pelosi said when Democrats take over in January, they will pass a bill that keeps border security funded at current levels.
“The President showed what he really thinks, he wants to shut down the government,” Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. “It’ll be a Trump shutdown and then Jan. 3, if it happens, the House will open it up again.”
Later, Schumer also backed away from a bipartisan Senate bill providing $1.6 billion in border fencing. Instead he's endorsing only the amount of funding that the president got last year: $1.3 billion.
Inside the White House meeting, the Democrats appeared united in their vow not to accede to Trump’s demands, but the president seemed to revel in battling both of them for the cameras.
Trump repeatedly said that the outgoing House GOP majority will give him his border wall funding and that the problem is Schumer’s Senate, bragging that Republicans held the upper chamber even as Schumer ridiculed him for touting wins in deep red states.
Then Trump turned his fire on Pelosi, questioning her negotiating position as she battles for the speakership. Liberals say the two Democratic leaders should deny Trump anything for his wall, and Pelosi is taking on a fight while she's still trying to accrue secure 218 votes to be elected speaker.
“If we don’t have border security, we’ll shut down the government,” Trump said, taunting Pelosi. “Nancy’s in a situation where it’s not easy to talk right now”
The California Democrat responded icily: “Please don’t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting.”
As Vice President Mike Pence watched on, Democrats said that the public firefight was unproductive.
“Let’s debate in private,” Schumer offered.
“Let us have a conversation where we don’t have to contradict in public,” Pelosi pleaded.
But Trump seemed to play up his persistence for the press.
“I will take the mantle,” Trump said of blame for a shut down. ""I will be the one to shut it down.”
Pelosi told her caucus earlier Tuesday that she and Schumer are pitching two funding options to Trump — neither of which would deliver a funding boost for the border wall, according to multiple people in Democratic Caucus meeting.
Both of their options would punt the border wall fight until fall 2019, long after House Democrats retake the majority, Pelosi told her caucus just ahead of the White House meeting.

Democrats planned to pitch Trump on a yearlong stopgap bill for the Department of Homeland Security, which would reup a current budget of $1.3 billion for border fencing, while approving the other six unfinished bills. That idea has already been rejected by GOP leaders on Capitol Hill.
They also intended to present a new backup option: Approve a massive yearlong stopgap bill, and punt all funding fights until fall 2019 to maximize Democratic leaders’ leverage in the House. But GOP leaders said they didn’t think Trump would sign something that barely speaks to his border wall request.
“I don’t expect the president would go along with that [if] he’s not getting the border funding he wants,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas).
Other Republicans said Trump’s remarks made their job harder but many blamed Democrats for being intractable.
“I don’t think it’s something to be proud of, I think it’s something to be resolved, “Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). “It’s absurd to deny this president additional wall money.”
Ahead of the meeting, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Pelosi and Schumer to cut a deal with Trump on funding the border wall, raising the prospects of another government shutdown this year over immigration. Senate Democrats refused to fund the government for a couple days in January in an effort to force a debate on immigration reform.
McConnell said he would watch “eagerly” to see if Democrats could accept a $5 billion infusion of money for border security.
“There is no reason for my Democratic friends to end this year the way they began it. It would be truly bizarre for them to decide they’d prefer a partial government shutdown to reasonable funding for national security. It would signal that their party is more committed to political spite for the president than to the public interest,” McConnell said.
While Congress has provided funding for border security, the massive spending bill Trump signed this spring was mostly restricted to fencing and border protection as a whole rather than a Trump-style wall or even the construction of wall prototypes.
He appeared to mix up the two again Tuesday when he claimed that Democrats voted in 2006 for a “wall,” which seems to refer to 2006 legislation to construct fencing along the southern border, even though it garnered little Democratic support in the House.
“If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall,” Trump wrote. “They know how important it is!”

2080,Trump sanctuary cities policies hit with another setback',New York Post,11/30/2018,,,https://nypost.com/2018/11/30/trump-sanctuary-cities-policies-hit-with-another-setback/,"A federal judge in Manhattan landed another blow to the Trump administration’s immigration policies Friday, blocking efforts to punish cities for protecting immigrants from the feds by blocking grants to local law enforcement.
The decision handed down by Judge Edgardo Ramos said the effort was unconstitutional because it violated the 10th Amendment and its separation-of-powers requirements.
The judge also determined the policy was “arbitrary and capricious.”
“As we argued, local law enforcement has the right to decide how to meet their local public safety needs — and the Trump administration simply does not have the right to require state and local police to act as federal immigration agents,” New York state Attorney General Barbara Underwood said in a statement. “The Trump administration’s attempt to withhold these vital funds was nothing more than a political attack at the expense of our public safety.”
New York was supposed to receive nearly $9 million from the grant program in 2017.
But the money was withheld after local officials refused to cooperate with new federal immigration policing requirements. Nearly half of that money would have flowed to New York City.
Underwood and five other AGs filed suit in July, challenging the policy.
It’s the latest in a series of federal rulings against President Trump’s controversial immigration policies.
A federal appeals court in California ruled earlier this month that Trump must continue a program that protects children brought to the US by their parents, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.
A separate federal court in San Francisco last week also blocked Trump’s efforts to deny asylum to immigrants crossing the southern border illegally."
6606,Federal judge in New York rules against Trump in sanctuary cities case',The Hill,11/30/2018,,,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/419146-judge-sides-with-sanctuary-cities-over-trump,"A federal judge on Friday ruled against the Trump administration's move to withhold grant funding from law enforcement agencies of so-called sanctuary cities, saying it was illegal and unconstitutional.
Judge Edgardo Ramos, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, said the government “did not have lawful authority” to make states alert federal agents when an undocumented immigrant is going to be released from state or local custody and allow federal agents to question immigrants in custody about their legal status in order for states and cities to receive funding.

In his ruling, Ramos blocked the government from enforcing those conditions on New York, New York City and the six states that also challenged the requirements: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington.
New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood (D) called the court’s decision a major win.
“As we argued, local law enforcement has the right to decide how to meet their local public safety needs — and the Trump administration simply does not have the right to require state and local police to act as federal immigration agents,” she said. “The Trump administration’s attempt to withhold these vital funds was nothing more than a political attack at the expense of our public safety.”
The challengers in Friday's case had asked Ramos to issue a nationwide injunction, but he said they had not shown that such a move was necessary to afford them relief. He also noted the scope of other district court decisions have been limited.
A judge for the Northern District of Illinois issued an injunction blocking the administration from enforcing the conditions nationwide in September 2017. The ruling was affirmed by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, but the court later put its nationwide scope on hold pending a review by the court’s full panel of judges.
In November 2017, a district court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania blocked the administration from enforcing the conditions on Philadelphia. The federal government has appealed that ruling to the 3rd Circuit. And a district court in California last month blocked the condition from being enforced on the city and county of San Francisco.

Yet another federal judge has found that the Trump administration’s attempts to strong-arm state and local governments into being as hostile to immigrants as possible is illegal.

U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District of New York ruled on Friday that that the executive order signed by President Donald Trump last January, which withheld funding from sanctuary cities, was both illegal and unconstitutional. Ramos agreed with the states that the order was a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be. . . in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,” per Ramos’ ruling.
The ruling falls in line with a number of recent court decisions shooting down Republican actions against asylum-seekers and sanctuary cities, as does Ramos’ decision to single out Section 1373 of the U.S. immigration code—like a California judge ruled in October, Ramos found that section, which requires of information-sharing between the federal government and sanctuary cities, was a violation of the Tenth Amendment.

What sets Ramos’ decision apart from the previous sanctuary city cases in California is that his will affect a wide swath of states up and down the East Coast—per the Providence Journal, cities in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Washington D.C., and Virginia will all now be legally allowed to function as havens for asylum-seekers, so long as their own state governments allow them to.
As has been pointed out before, while some cities under Democratic control have fought to maintain this legal status, their actual commitment to protecting undocumented immigrants and asylum-seekers has fallen flat time and again, with police departments ( including those in New York City) routinely working with ICE and federal agencies to detain and deport community members.
As far as Trump’s larger war on migrants and refugee s goes , however, this is undoubtedly good news."

The president's tweet came the morning after Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents clashed with a group of migrants who rushed the southern border.
CBP on Sunday shut down the busy San Ysidro port of entry near San Diego as the migrants approached. Tensions flared further when dozens of migrants broke away from a larger group to try and cross the border.
CBP said in a statement that officers fired tear gas into the crowd after attempted illegal crossings and after some migrants threw rocks at border agents.
Photos quickly circulated on Twitter of women and children fleeing the tear gas, providing a stark contrast to Trump's repeated claims that the group of migrants is filled with ""criminals"" and ""thugs.""

Hundreds of migrants have been camped out in Tijuana, Mexico, as they wait to enter the U.S. Many are fleeing violence and poverty in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Trump has said those migrants will remain in Mexico while their asylum claims are processed by the U.S.
The president has for weeks painted the caravan of Central American migrants as an imminent security threat. He has vowed to close down the border, deployed thousands of troops to the border in anticipation of the groups arrival and signed a proclamation blocking certain immigrants from claiming asylum.
A federal judge last week blocked the proclamation.
UPDATE 4:13 p.m.: Trump later spoke with reporters on the White House lawn about the incident as he set out for a campaign rally in Mississippi.
The president against suggested the border could be closed as he insisted members of the immigrant caravan would not be let into the United States.
""We've during certain times, as you know, closed the border. They're not coming into the United States. They will not be coming into our country,"" Trump said.
Asked if he was comfortable with the use of tear gas at the border, Trump said authorities at the border were forced to do so.
""They had to use because they were being rushed by some very tough people and they used tear gas. And here's the bottom line: nobody's coming into our country unless they come in legally,"" he said."
2309,Trump seizes on border unrest ahead of perilous month',CNN (Web News),11/26/2018,,,https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/26/politics/donald-trump-robert-mueller-democrats-congress-g20-december/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump is seizing on an attempt by 500 migrants to rush the southern border to use immigration as an issue to bolster his presidency at a critical political moment.
Trump spent weeks ahead of the midterm elections warning that the United States was about to experience an invasion from a migrant caravan trekking north across Mexico, and sent troops to the border in what critics branded a political stunt.
He seized on unrest at the frontier on Sunday to hike pressure on Mexico and to squeeze his political opponents in Washington as he demands financing for his border wall in a looming government funding showdown.
""Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries,"" Trump tweeted early Monday morning.
""Do it by plane, do it by bus, do it anyway you want, but they are NOT coming into the U.S.A. We will close the Border permanently if need be. Congress, fund the WALL!""
Trump was reacting to reports that a group of migrants overwhelmed both Mexican federal and local police blockades and rushed towards the border at one of the busiest crossings between Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego. US authorities said several Border Patrol agents were hit by rocks, prompting the use of tear gas. Border crossings were closed in both directions for several hours, and it did not appear that any migrants breached the frontier.
The situation appeared to fall well short of the mass invasion by a caravan of thousands of migrants conjured up by Trump before the midterms.
Sunday's events will further electrify political tensions in Washington as it gets to work after the Thanksgiving holiday and ahead of a month of transition and increasing vulnerability for the President.
Trump is also set to travel to another big international summit this week -- the G20 in Argentina -- that carries the habitual possibility that he could again fall out with other world leaders. The trip will also bring him face-to-face with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the most contentious moment in US-China relations for decades as a trade war rages between the two powers.

Democrats lining up investigations
Most ominously for Trump, Democrats are positioning themselves to unleash an unprecedented regime of investigation and oversight against his White House as soon as they take the reins of power in January, while special counsel Robert Mueller grinds away ever closer to the President's inner circle
Just how miserable things could get next year for the President was revealed by incoming House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. The California Democrat vowed to bring acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker before Congress to probe whether he was appointed with the express purpose of disrupting the Mueller investigation.
He said the President was not being honest in casting doubt on the CIA's conclusion that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
Schiff also said the new Democratic House would investigate whether the President's response to this and other foreign policy questions was being influenced by a ""hidden hand"" of investments or past or business ties.
""Is his personal financial interest driving US policy in the Gulf? Is it driving US policy vis-a-vis the Russians? We don't know, but it would be irresponsible not to find out,"" Schiff said.
On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who will head the House Oversight Committee, vowed proportionate investigations.
""The American people said to us through this election, 'We want accountability. We want to check on this President of the United States.' But they also said something else. They said, 'We want you to solve our problems,'"" Cummings said.
A glimpse of how Washington will change
The prospects of flying subpoenas and administration officials being hauled up to Capitol Hill points to crucial dynamics ahead of the 2020 elections.
How will the President react? Will Democrats overreach and play into McConnell's warnings of ""presidential harassment?"" Can the President leverage Democratic opposition to court suburban voters who deserted him in the midterms? Or will any revelations either from congressional probes or Mueller prove to be so serious that they bury his White House in scandal and put his entire presidency at risk?
Trump could emerge from a period of retooling in his administration facing even fewer restraints from subordinates than has already been the case.
Key officials like Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and White House chief of staff John Kelly are waiting to see if they will be retained. And Trump denied a Wall Street Journal report that he's getting irked by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over recent stock market losses.
Mnuchin is not currently thought to be threatened, but the report, and the President's frequent tweeting about oil prices and the markets, does appear to hint at some nervousness over the future of the economy, which in its currently roaring state is the best argument for his 2020 re-election hopes.
In a glimpse into the feudal nature of life in Trump's orbit, his former political aide Corey Lewandowski writes in his new book that enemies of the President are ""embedded"" in the White House and government agencies and trying to thwart his agenda, according to The Washington Post.
Trump has often embraced moments of converging threats and challenges to stoke an atmosphere of chaos in Washington that bolsters his standing with his political base and puts his opponents off balance.
But he now faces a test of his political strategy since his method -- for instance, using inflammatory rhetoric about immigration -- appears to have hurt Republicans in House races, even if it boosted Senate contenders.
For now, there is no sign of an adjustment: Trump broke convention in his Thanksgiving calls with troops by injecting political rhetoric about immigration and trade and boasting about his success.
His recent behavior, including a feud with Chief Justice John Roberts, either betrays an inability to rein in his relish for confrontation or a strategic decision that the wrecking ball approach is the best way to ensure his re-election.
Back on the border
Trump spent part of the weekend highlighting the migrant caravan.
""If for any reason it becomes necessary, we will CLOSE our Southern Border. There is no way that the United States will, after decades of abuse, put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore!"" Trump tweeted Saturday.
He may return to the topic on Monday in a pair of rallies for Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who is facing a runoff amid controversy over her past racially-tinged comments and actions.
The Washington Post reported that the incoming administration in Mexico has agreed to allow asylum seekers to remain south of the US border while their applications were processed, in what would be seen by Trump as a victory.
The new government, however, denied in a statement to CNN that a deal had been done.
A migrant is pushed back as she attempts to reach the border wall.
The politics of immigration will bear watching in the weeks ahead since they are crucial to Trump, who tends to resort to extremes, and Democrats who do not wish to come across as soft on border issues.
One Republican, Sen. Joni Ernst, who faces a potentially tricky Iowa re-election race in 2020, hinted at the delicate nature of an issue that electrifies Trump's base but can alienate more moderate voters on ""State of the Union.""
She said she would prefer that Trump not follow through on his threat to close the US border, though pointed to the reports from Mexico to argue his rhetoric could be working.
""I certainly think the President sees results any time that he does bring up an issue, and he does lay down certain reasons why he's doing what he's doing,"" Ernst told CNN's Dana Bash.
Ernst also said she hoped that Trump would not honor threats to partially shutter the government if he does not get his border wall funded.
Trump said last week that if there was ever going to be a shutdown over the border wall, now would probably be the time to do it.
Congress averted a shutdown in September by passing a massive spending bill to fund a large portion of the government. The package did not, however, include money for Trump's wall. Instead, lawmakers passed a shorter-term spending bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, among other agencies, until December 7.
It's not clear either side really wants a shutdown. If precedent is any guide, it's also possible the funding crunch could be put off by short-term deals that run until the end of the year or beyond.
The calculations could also influence other priorities in the mix, including disaster funding requests for fire-ravaged California, and a drive by Democrats and some Republicans to shield Mueller.
Bipartisan anger over Trump's approach to Saudi Arabia could also complicate deal making, with both sides conscious of how actions now could play out in the new political reality next year."
5568,Trump tells Mexico to ship migrants home or see border permanently closed',Fox News (Online),11/26/2018,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-tells-mexico-to-ship-migrants-home-or-see-border-permanently-closed,"President Trump offered Mexico some advice on deporting migrants massed in Tijuana and threatening to storm the U.S., telling the neighboring nation in a tweet to send them “back to their countries” by plane or by bus – or face a permanent closure of the border.
Trump’s tweet followed a vow from Mexico to deport migrants who tried to illegally enter the U.S. The Trump administration has said asylum claims from members of a series of caravans originating in Central America must be processed outside the U.S., and that all those entering illegally will be denied. A federal judge has at least temporarily ruled against the policy, but the administration has taken steps to harden the border.
“Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries,” Trump tweeted early Monday morning. “Do it by plane, do it by bus, do it anyway you want, but they are NOT coming into the U.S.A. We will close the Border permanently if need be. Congress, fund the WALL!”
The missive came after a chaotic Sunday that saw hundreds of migrants from a caravan that originated in Central American pushing past Mexican riot police and rushing the border at the port of entry in San Ysidro, Calif., in a major test for both U.S. border authorities and Mexican officials.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it suspended northbound and southbound crossings for both pedestrians and vehicles at the San Ysidro port of entry at approximately 11:30 a.m. local time. It later tweeted that the pedestrian crossings had re-opened, a little more than four hours after the initial closure. The vehicle lanes re-opened at approximately 5 p.m. local time, five-and-a-half hours after they were closed.
CBP added that some demonstrators ""attempted to illegally enter the U.S. through both the northbound and southbound vehicle lanes at the port of entry itself. Those persons were stopped and turned back to Mexico.""
U.S. border agents shot several rounds of tear gas after some migrants attempted to penetrate various points along the border and threw what appeared to be rocks at U.S. authorities.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement that some migrants ""attempted to breach legacy fence infrastructure along the border and sought to harm CBP personnel by throwing projectiles at them.
""As I have continually stated, DHS will not tolerate this type of lawlessness and will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons,"" Nielsen said. ""We will also seek to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who destroys federal property, endangers our frontline operators, or violates our nation’s sovereignty.""
The Mexican Interior Ministry said Sunday it would immediately deport the migrants who tried to ""violently"" breach the border. The Mexican government described Sunday's events as ""acts of provocation"" that were ""far from helpful"" for the migrants' objectives.
The situation Sunday was not unprecedented. In 2013, during the Obama administration, Border Patrol agents used pepper spray to fend off a crowd of approximately 100 migrants who attempted to rush the San Ysidro port of entry. The migrants in that episode also reportedly threw rocks and bottles at U.S. authorities.
Within an hour on Sunday, the group from the caravan that rushed toward the border largely dispersed. Most of the migrants in the group were men.
The prospective deal between the U.S. and Mexico was seen as a way to dissuade thousands of Central American migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S., a process that can take years. The legal bar for claiming asylum is high and generally requires applicants to show a specific risk of persecution based on factors such as race, nationality, politics or religion.
Trump administration officials have characterized the vast majority of asylum claims as fraudulent or legally insufficient, and have taken steps to reduce the backlog of asylum claims that they say are often used by migrants to gain entry into the U.S. and disappear into the country as their claims are adjudicated."

Mexico's incoming foreign minister has said discussions on how to deal with migrants travelling to the United States are continuing despite reports a deal has been reached.
Marcelo Ebrard denied reaching an agreement which would see asylum seekers waiting in Mexico while their claims were processed in US courts.
Mr Ebrard's words seem to contradict US President Donald Trump's latest tweet.
He said migrants would not be allowed entry until their claims were approved.
""Migrants at the Southern Border will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court,"" Mr Trump wrote, adding: ""No 'releasing' into the US. All will stay in Mexico.""
The conflicting statements emerged after the Washington Post reported Mexican officials had agreed to let migrants trying to enter the US stay in Mexico while their asylum claims were heard.
According to the newspaper, the plan was called ""Remain in Mexico"".
But Mr Ebrard, who will become foreign minister in December after Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's administration takes power, said the US had yet to even send ""a specific proposal"" on how to deal with the issue.
He said conversations were still taking place with Washington.

Incoming Interior Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero also told news agency Reuters no agreement had been reached - although the Washington Post article initially quoted her as saying it was a ""short term solution"" to deal with the migrant caravan.
Thousands of migrants - including women and children - are currently at the US-Mexico border after travelling more than 4,000km (2,500 miles) from Central America.
They say they are fleeing persecution, poverty and violence in their home countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.
Many are now waiting in temporary shelters in the border city of Tijuana, leading the mayor declare a humanitarian crisis. There are fears as many as 9,000 may be stuck in the city for months.
Meanwhile, Mr Trump has deployed about 5,800 troops to the border and has previously described the migrants as an ""invasion""."

“There is no agreement of any sort between the incoming Mexican government and the U.S. government,” future Interior Minister Olga Sanchez told Reuters on Saturday, contradicting Trump and an earlier Washington Post report that said a deal ― albeit an informal one ― had been struck between the two governments.
The Post had quoted Sanchez as saying the administration of Mexico’s President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who will take office on Dec. 1, had “for now” agreed to the so-called “Remain in Mexico” plan.
Sanchez was quoted by the paper as saying that Mexico would allow asylum seekers to stay in the country as a “short-term solution.”
Following the publication of the Post’s report, however, Sanchez back-pedaled on those remarks. She told Reuters that Obrador’s administration was “in talks” with the U.S., but stressed officials who weren’t yet in office couldn’t formally make any agreements.
ASSOCIATED PRESS Seven-year-old Honduran migrant Genesis Belen Mejia Flores waves an American flag at two U.S. border control helicopters flying overhead near a shelter in Tijuana, Mexico.
Reuters reported that Sanchez “did not explicitly rule out” that Mexico could allow Central American caravan migrants ― thousands of whom have arrived in Tijuana, just south of California ― to wait in the country while their claims are processed in the U.S.
Sanchez did, however, say that plans for Mexico to assume “safe third country” status had been “ruled out.” Under a “safe third” agreement, the U.S. could force migrants to seek asylum in Mexico.
Trump said in a pair of Saturday evening tweets that migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border “will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court.”
“No ‘Releasing’ into the U.S. … All will stay in Mexico,” the president wrote.
His tweets were interpreted as possible confirmation of the posible deal between the U.S. and Obrador’s administration.
Migrants at the Southern Border will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court. We only will allow those who come into our Country legally. Other than that our very strong policy is Catch and Detain. No “Releasing” into the U.S... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2018

Tijuana Mayor Juan Manuel Gastélum declared a humanitarian crisis last week as approximately 5,000 Central American migrants fleeing violence and poverty arrived in the city ― to the chagrin of many locals.
Gastélum said on Friday that he’d asked the United Nations for aid to help with the influx of asylum seekers."
6428,"Mexico denies deal with White House on migrants, as Trump threatens to close entire border'",Fox News (Online),11/25/2018,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mexico-denies-deal-with-white-house-on-migrants-as-trump-threatens-to-close-entire-border,"Images and videos posted on social media Sunday afternoon showed hundreds of migrants from the leading Central American caravan pushing past Mexican riot police and rushing the border at the port of entry in San Ysidro, Calif., in a major test for both U.S. border authorities and Mexican officials.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it suspended northbound and southbound crossings for both pedestrians and vehicles at the San Ysidro port of entry at approximately 11:30 a.m. local time. It later tweeted that the pedestrian crossings had re-opened, a little more than four hours after the initial closure. The vehicle lanes re-opened at approximately 5 p.m. local time, five-and-a-half hours after they were closed.
CBP added that some demonstrators ""attempted to illegally enter the U.S. through both the northbound and southbound vehicle lanes at the port of entry itself. Those persons were stopped and turned back to Mexico.""
U.S. border agents shot several rounds of tear gas after some migrants attempted to penetrate various points along the border and threw what appeared to be rocks at U.S. authorities.
Mexico's Milenio TV showed images of migrants climbing over fences and peeling back metal sheeting to enter. Tear gas fumes were carried by the wind toward people who were hundreds of feet away, including some children.
Honduran Ana Zuniga, 23, also said she saw migrants opening a small hole in concertina wire at a gap on the Mexican side of a levee, at which point U.S. agents fired tear gas at them.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement that some migrants ""attempted to breach legacy fence infrastructure along the border and sought to harm CBP personnel by throwing projectiles at them.
""As I have continually stated, DHS will not tolerate this type of lawlessness and will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons,"" Nielsen said. ""We will also seek to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who destroys federal property, endangers our frontline operators, or violates our nation’s sovereignty.""
The Mexican Interior Ministry said Sunday afternoon it would immediately deport the migrants who tried to ""violently"" breach the border. The Mexican government described Sunday's events as ""acts of provocation"" that were ""far from helpful"" for the migrants' objectives.
Earlier this month, President Trump said that troops stationed at the border would treat thrown rocks like ""firearms.""
""We're not going to put up with that,"" the president said. ""They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. I told them to consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks, like they did at the Mexico military and police, I said, consider it a rifle.""
The situation Sunday was not unprecedented. In 2013, during the Obama administration, Border Patrol agents used pepper spray to fend off a crowd of approximately 100 migrants who attempted to rush the San Ysidro port of entry. The migrants in that episode also reportedly threw rocks and bottles at U.S. authorities.
Within an hour on Sunday, the group from the caravan that rushed toward the border largely dispersed. Most of the migrants in the group were men.
Fox News had confirmed early Sunday through an organizer for Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the group helping organize the leading Central American migrant caravan, that members of the caravan were planning to attempt to cross the port of entry at San Ysidro later in the day.
Footage posted by ITV correspondent Emma Murphy also showed several U.S. Border Patrol helicopters reportedly flying low overhead on the Mexican side of the border.
In anticipation of the planned migrant effort, U.S. authorities said they had deployed additional personnel to the San Ysidro port of entry on Sunday, including Air and Marine agents.
Other video showed migrants pushing toward a border fence chanting, ""Yes we can.""
The dramatic escalation at the border came as Mexico's incoming government denied reports Saturday that it had struck a deal with the White House to keep asylum-seekers in the country while their claims move through U.S. immigration courts. President Trump, for his part, again threatened to close the entire southern border if no deal could be reached between the two counties.
On Saturday, the first episode of caravan-related violence directed at U.S. authorities was reported by U.S. Border Patrol in Arizona, as a 31-year-old Honduran man who apparently split off from the caravan threw rocks at agents and a helicopter after setting a tree on fire.

The prospective deal between the U.S. and Mexico was seen as a way to dissuade thousands of Central American migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S., a process that can take years. The legal bar for claiming asylum is high and generally requires applicants to show a specific risk of persecution based on factors such as race, nationality, politics or religion.
Trump administration officials have characterized the vast majority of asylum claims as fraudulent or legally insufficient, and have taken steps to reduce the backlog of asylum claims that they say are often used by migrants to gain entry into the U.S. and disappear into the country as their claims are adjudicated.
TRUMP SLAMS 'DISGRACEFUL' NINTH CIRCUIT AFTER ASYLUM RULING, CALLS IT RUBBER-STAMP FOR HIS FOES
""There is no agreement of any sort between the incoming Mexican government and the U.S. government,"" future Interior Minister Olga Sanchez said in a statement.
Hours earlier, The Washington Post quoted her as saying that the incoming administration of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had agreed to allow migrants to stay in Mexico as a ""short-term solution"" while the U.S. considered their applications for asylum. Lopez Obrador will take office on Dec. 1.
The Washington Post reported Saturday that the Trump administration has won support from the Mexican president-elect's team for a plan dubbed ""Remain in Mexico.""
The newspaper also quoted Sanchez as saying: ""For now, we have agreed to this policy of Remain in Mexico."" Sanchez did not explain in the statement why The Washington Post had quoted her as saying there had been an agreement.
TRUMP ADMIN SHARPLY LIMITS ASYLUM CLAIMS, CITING WIDESPREAD FRAUD, FEDERAL LAW
Early Sunday, Trump wrote on Twitter that it would be ""very SMART"" for Mexico to ""stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border"" to avoid future logistics challenges at the border.
There were signs last week that the Mexican government has received that message. Mexican immigration agents on Wednesday detained almost all of the Central American migrants on a fourth caravan that recently entered Mexico seeking to reach the U.S., with Mexico's National Immigration Institute saying 213 migrants were detained and taken to a processing center. Those found to lack proper documents may face repatriation to their home countries.
Other administration officials sounded notes of optimism despite the apparent confusion on how to handle the migrants.
WATCH: SAN DIEGO BORDER PATROL DIRECTOR SAYS HE'S 'PREPARING FOR THE WORST'
""President Trump has developed a strong relationship with the incoming [Lopez] Obrador administration, and we look forward to working with them on a wide range of issues,"" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said over the weekend.
Approximately 5,000 Central American migrants have arrived in recent days to Tijuana, just south of California, after making their way through Mexico via caravan. But agents at the San Diego port of entry process fewer than 100 claims per day.
On Friday, the mayor of Tijuana declared a humanitarian crisis in his border city of 1.6 million people, saying he was asking the United Nations for aid to deal with the approximately 5,000 Central American migrants, most of whom were camped out inside a sports complex.
The comments by Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum came as city officials and volunteers worked together to assist the 4,976 men, women and children who had arrived after more than a month on the road.
Hundreds of Tijuana residents have protested their arrival, complaining that recent caravans forced their way into Mexico from Guatemala.
Trump threatened Thursday, and again on Saturday, to shut down the border crossing entirely if his administration determines that Mexico has lost ""control"" of the situation in Tijuana.
Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin, described the Remain in Mexico plan as a strategy to take away the ability of migrants to live and work in the U.S. while cases are processed.
""The hope is that asylum seekers will not want to live in [Mexico] for months/years and won't come,"" Leutert wrote on Twitter.
She added: ""The big question is why would Mexico agree to this? ... Mexico has its own migratory enforcement interests and the various caravans have been a huge headache.""
U.S. officials have said for months that they were working with Mexico on possible proposals. One variation, called ""Safe Third,"" would have denied asylum claims on the grounds that asylum seekers had found haven in Mexico. President Enrique Pena Nieto offered thousands of Central Americans asylum on Oct. 26 if they agreed to remain in southern Mexico. Close to 3,000 migrants took Mexico up on the offer.
Sanchez said Saturday that the next government does not plan for Mexico to become a ""Safe Third"" country.
Julieta Vences, a congresswoman with Lopez Obrador's Morena party who is also president of Mexico's congressional migrant affairs commission, told the AP that incoming Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard has been discussing with U.S. officials how to handle a deluge of asylum claims at the border.
""They're going to have to open the borders (for the migrants) to put in the request,"" Vences said. ""They will also give us dates, on what terms they will receive the (asylum) requests and in the case that they are not beneficiaries of this status, they will have to return here,"" Vences said.
She said Mexico needs to examine how to accommodate the migrants without angering locals.
""When they come back, we need to see how ... we can integrate them into an economic activity so that they can develop and not generate conflict with our own communities.""
Local churches and charities have been feeding the migrants, with assistance from state and federal agencies. They also have distributed thousands of blankets, thin mattresses and personal hygiene kits.

5954,"Tensions rise at U.S.-Mexico border as migrants, holiday travelers wait to cross'",Reuters,11/23/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-caravan/tensions-rise-at-u-s-mexico-border-as-migrants-holiday-travelers-wait-to-cross-idUSKCN1NS01A,"TIJUANA (Reuters) - Hundreds of Central American migrants in Mexico massed on Thursday around a tense U.S. border crossing, where security measures held up long lines of Mexicans headed to Thanksgiving gatherings on the other side of the frontier.
With few belongings, and many of them with children in tow, the migrants set out for the crossing from the baseball field in the Mexican border city of Tijuana where they have been camped out. Around 6,000 migrants who have trekked across Mexico in a caravan in recent weeks are now crammed into the field.
They arrived at the Chaparral border crossing, opposite San Diego, California, and said they would wait there until they could request asylum, in spite of growing U.S. measures to tighten the border.
“We are already desperate, last night it rained and we all got wet. There is no room left. We are all sick. My children have a cold ... and nobody has come to give us help,” said David, a Honduran who only provided his first name.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he had authorized the use of lethal force on the border and warned that the United States could close the whole frontier.
The San Ysidro vehicular crossing into San Diego, one of the busiest in the world, was briefly shuttered in the afternoon by U.S. officials as they performed a security exercise.
Tens of thousands of Mexicans enter the United States daily to work or study, and many were trying to get to Thanksgiving celebrations. Mariana del Campo, a retired professor, had hoped to make it across before the closing, but was stuck in the line.
“What’s happening on the border is maddening,” she said as she waited in her car. “I don’t know how long we can put up with this. Someone is going to get tired or explode.”
Also stuck in her car waiting to cross for Thanksgiving was 54-year-old Aurora Diaz, who said her U.S.-based daughter was reluctant to visit Mexico in case Trump closed the border.
U.S. OR BUST
Tensions were palpable at the pedestrian crossing where the Central Americans had gathered. Mexican police and soldiers stood guard while a helicopter buzzed over the U.S side.
Edgar Corzo, an official from Mexico’s human rights commission, spoke into a megaphone to the crowd, telling them they could request assistance in Mexico.
But migrants arrived with blankets and prepared to bed down for the night outside the border station. Some of the children cried and complained of the cold.

Authorities in Tijuana said the migrants are facing up to a six-month wait to be able to get an appointment to plead their case for asylum with U.S. authorities.
Earlier this week, U.S. officials briefly closed the main border crossing in Tijuana, putting up concrete barricades and razor wire after reports that migrants could try to rush the crossing.
“I want President Trump to know that we’re peaceful people, we don’t have weapons, we haven’t come to do evil,” said a man who declined to give his name, holding a white flag on a wooden stick that read “Peace, God is with us.” “We want to work, we want them to help us for the love of God,” he added."
6825,Why and how are asylum seekers entering the U.S.?',Los Angeles Times,11/23/2018,,,https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-asylum-seekers-qa-20181122-story.html,"Many immigrants entering the U.S. — legally and illegally — claim asylum. Advocates for greater limits on immigration, particularly “chain migration” based on family relationships rather than employment skills, have tried to restrict asylum seekers.
This month, President Trump issued a proclamation preventing immigrants from claiming asylum if they crossed the border illegally. On Monday, a federal judge in San Francisco blocked that “asylum ban.”
But the judge’s ruling did not address another U.S. policy that’s forcing asylum seekers to wait on the Mexican side of border bridges, adding their names to growing waiting lists maintained by Mexican officials. On Thursday, a small group of Central American migrants marched peacefully to a border crossing in Tijuana to demand better conditions and push to enter the U.S. We talked to migrants waiting to cross the border legally at a shelter and border bridge in Matamoros, Mexico, and those who had crossed illegally and were released by U.S. immigration officials in neighboring Brownsville, Texas, last week — with notices to appear in immigration court — about why and how they were seeking asylum.
Why cross legally at a border bridge or illegally via the Rio Grande?

Most asylum seekers at the Matamoros bridge said they understood that by law, it was legal to enter the U.S. via the bridge. Some were aware of Trump’s edict and feared that if they crossed the Rio Grande illegally, they could hurt their chances of being granted asylum. But with the Mexican list having grown last week to 80 names, they also worried about how long they would have to wait to cross. Some had already waited more than a month. Many of the migrants had been granted temporary visas in Mexico that had expired or were due to expire by month’s end, and they worried they could be deported.
“I came here because I thought it would be faster,” said Cuban asylum seeker Ronald Padron, 37, who had waited 26 days at the Matamoros bridge.

Among migrants released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the bus station in Brownsville, most said they had crossed the Rio Grande illegally about 60 miles west near Reynosa, a Gulf cartel stronghold. They had been released after Trump’s announcement because it was still up to asylum officers and immigration judges to decide the validity of their asylum claims.

Many said they were unaware that there was a border bridge in Reynosa, or that it was possible to cross the bridge legally. Some who had seen the bridge said they were afraid to approach, because it was surrounded by Mexican drug cartel lookouts.
“They told me they would kidnap me if I went to the bridge … it’s very difficult to decide” how to cross the border, said Honduran migrant Wilmer Gamez, 37, who crossed the river near Reynosa.
Other migrants said they crossed the river — on foot or rafts — because it was the most direct or cheapest route. They said they paid smugglers $1,000 to $2,400.

Honduran migrant Jessica Morillo, 26, paid $2,400 to cross the river near Reynosa. She didn’t know about Trump’s action or that she could cross a nearby border bridge. She said she fled her home country because a drug trafficker had raped her, then threatened her with a gun. When she told her father she was pregnant in September, he threw her out, and she had been staying with a cousin. She hoped to join her sister in New Orleans.
Do most asylum seekers have relatives in the U.S.?
Almost all of the Central American asylum seekers at the bridge in Matamoros and at the bus station in Brownsville said they had relatives in the U.S. Most of the relatives, they said, were parents, siblings, uncles or cousins spread across the country, from Los Angeles to Miami, New York and Washington. Some at the bus station were seeking to join family working in rural areas of Nebraska and Mississippi. Most African migrants at the bridge said they did not have relatives in the U.S. and hoped to join friends instead. Tsenay Bogale, 48, of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, came with her aunt hoping to join friends in Washington.
What did asylum seekers do for work in their home countries?

Many of the Central American immigrants said they were farmers and store clerks. There was also a mechanic, nurse and teacher. All said they hoped to work in the U.S. None had advanced degrees. A few were elderly, joining younger relatives or friends.
In the U.S., political asylum is provided to those fleeing persecution — what are they fleeing?
Some of the asylum seekers were unfamiliar with U.S. law, which holds that asylum seekers must have a “credible fear” of being persecuted in their home countries based on their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a “particular social group.” In the past, that included victims of domestic and gang violence; this year, then-Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions issued a ruling saying such victims don’t qualify.
Norma Torres and her husband said they fled Nicaragua with their three children five weeks ago after they were threatened by soldiers for protesting and working with Catholic groups challenging the ruling government.

“No one can say anything” against the government, she said.
The couple knew it was illegal to cross between border bridges, had seen reports about Trump’s asylum ban and chose to wait at the Matamoros shelter instead of crossing the river. Mexican officials had yet to issue them a number on the waiting list last week.
“No one is helping us,” said Torres, 35.
Rene Hormaza, 28, who ran a cafeteria in Cuba, said he fled with his wife and two children after being threatened by police in August.

“If you don’t shut your mouth, they disappear you,” he said of Cuban authorities as he waited at the border bridge. “I have the hope that the U.S. will help us Cubans.”

Migrants from Guatemala in Matamoros and at the bus station said they fled a combination of economic and political hardships. Some from urban areas said they were unable to find work. Farmers said their coffee crops had suffered blight. At the same time, they said they had trouble moving or finding work because of political corruption and nepotism. It would be up to a U.S. asylum officer and immigration judge to decide if they qualified for asylum.
African migrants in Matamoros described being threatened and attacked for speaking out and protesting against oppressive governments.

Lynda Fotso, 24, a stock clerk from Cameroon, said she was detained for protesting against the government in 2015. An only child, she doesn’t have friends or family in neighboring countries. She first fled to Nigeria, but didn’t apply for asylum there because she knew the government had returned other migrants from Cameroon. She speaks French and some English but no Spanish, so once she landed in South America, she headed for the U.S., which she and other migrants from Cameroon called a bastion of human rights.
“I just want safety,” Fotso said in French as she sat waiting in the dark with other asylum seekers at the foot of the border bridge. “I can better adapt in the U.S.”
Farmer Collins Fondong, 33, also left Cameroon after being threatened by police for criticizing the government. He has lymphatic filariasis, a tropical disease, and ran out of medication after he arrived in Mexico in September. He was No. 29 on the list of asylum seekers waiting to cross at Matamoros last week.
“I pray it works,” he said of the list. “When you’re running away from death, you will do anything.”

He was eventually allowed to cross and volunteers said he received treatment at a local hospital.
Why didn’t they seek asylum in Mexico, or one of the countries they crossed en route to Mexico?
Advocates for greater limits on immigration have pushed for a “safe third country” agreement between the U.S. and Mexico, similar to the one the U.S. has with Canada, that would force migrants who arrive in Mexico to first seek asylum there. Immigrant advocates argue Mexico is too dangerous, its asylum processing too rudimentary, to be considered a safe refuge.
Asylum seekers in Matamoros, including Fotso, said they feared for their safety in Mexico and did not consider seeking asylum there. Central American and Cuban migrants said their goal was to join relatives in the U.S. African migrants said they didn’t speak Spanish and had a better chance of finding work and building new lives in the U.S. rather than in Mexico.

Migrants from Cameroon mostly fled through Nigeria, flying to Ecuador, then traveling by bus and on foot through the perilous jungles of Central America. They had read reports of fellow migrants being detained and deported in Nigeria, and so didn’t consider seeking asylum there.

Michael Randy, 30, a businessman from Cameroon, said he fled to the U.S. because it was the only country in the world he trusted to respect human rights. He had read reports about fellow members of Cameroon’s Anglophone minority who fled to Nigeria and were returned by the government to Cameroonian authorities.
“Massacres are happening in my country, genocide. Just the fact that you speak English in my country is a problem,” said Randy. “I have to be somewhere I feel safe.”

The migrants said they are carrying the white flags to show that they are peaceful, and will attempt to present themselves as asylum seekers near Baja, Calif., The San Diego Union-Tribune reported.
President Trump on Thursday threatened to close the border with Mexico if his administration determines that Mexico has lost control of the situation. The Union-Tribune reported that Mexican federal police held a barrier near a pedestrian crossing and urged the migrants to apply for jobs in Tijuana. Police claimed there are thousands of jobs in the city. Federal police were dressed in riot gear and prevented the caravan from getting closer to the U.S.
Carlos Lopez, a Honduran who was leading the small group, told the paper that the conditions in Mexico are horrible. He said there are sick children and women and children are forced to remain outside in the elements. Those already in the city have camped out in tents, slept on dirt fields or under bleachers or are staying in overcrowded shelters throughout the city as they wait to figure out their next steps.
""The whole world is watching what is happening here,"" he said.
The report said the larger group contains about 6,219 Central Americans. The federal government estimates the number of migrants could grow to 10,000 in the coming weeks, or months. President Trump warned that the caravan is a national security threat and it will not enter the U.S.
On Monday, a judge barred the president from enforcing a ban on asylum for those who cross the U.S. border illegally – a decision the administration said would cause “countless illegal aliens to pour into our country.""
The report said that the migrants who traveled for over a month can now see a bridge that separates them from the U.S.
Speaking to reporters while in Florida for the holiday, Trump threatened to close the U.S. border with Mexico for an undisclosed period of time if his administration determines that its southern ally has lost ""control"" on its side.
Trump also said he has given the thousands of active-duty troops he sent to the border before the Nov. 6 midterm elections the ""OK"" to use lethal force against migrants ""if they have to."" And he said Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, whom he has faulted for not being tough enough on immigration, is ""in there trying.""

Critics accused President Trump of circumventing Congress and rights groups like the ACLU challenged the decision in court. The opponents have now won a short term victory.
Judge Jon S. Tigar of the United States District Court in San Francisco issued a temporary restraining order on Monday blocking the new rule.
""Whatever the scope of the president’s authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden,” Tigar wrote.
Brandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol Council, responded on Fox News Tuesday, saying that the judge “just encouraged migrants to break the law.”
The White House is expected to appeal the decision.
President Trump has sounded off on the migrant caravan heading toward the U.S.-Mexico border, calling it an ""invasion."" He sent about 5,000 troops to the border to prevent the caravan from entering the U.S.

“Our asylum system is broken, and it is being abused by tens of thousands of meritless claims every year,” Katie Waldman, spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, and Steve Stafford, the Justice Department spokesman, said in a statement.
They said the president has broad authority to stop the entry of migrants into the country. “It is absurd that a set of advocacy groups can be found to have standing to sue to stop the entire federal government from acting so that illegal aliens can receive a government benefit to which they are not entitled,” they said. “We look forward to continuing to defend the executive branch’s legitimate and well-reasoned exercise of its authority to address the crisis at our southern border.”
Presidents indeed have broad discretion on immigration matters. But the court’s ruling shows that such discretion has limits, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration scholar at Cornell Law School.
“The ruling is a significant blow to the administration’s efforts to unilaterally change asylum law. Ultimately this may have to go to the Supreme Court for a final ruling,” said Mr. Yale-Loehr.
The advocacy groups accused the government of “violating Congress’s clear command that manner of entry cannot constitute a categorical asylum bar” in their complaint. They also said the administration had violated federal guidelines by not allowing public comment on the rule.
But Trump administration officials defended the regulatory change, arguing that the president was responding to a surge in migrants seeking asylum based on frivolous claims, which ultimately lead their cases to be denied by an immigration judge. The migrants then ignore any orders to leave, and remain unlawfully in the country."
6003,"Federal judge blocks Trump's new asylum rules: 'He may not rewrite the immigration laws'""",USA TODAY,11/20/2018,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/11/19/federal-judge-blocks-trumps-new-asylum-rules-migrant-caravan/2060994002/,"A federal judge in San Francisco blocked new rules put into place by President Donald Trump that limit the ability of immigrants to request asylum, a legal blow to the administration’s efforts to curb legal immigration that opens the door for more members of the immigrant caravan to request asylum in the USA.
U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar ruled late Monday that the administration's new policy of cutting off asylum to immigrants who enter the country illegally appears to run afoul of U.S. law that specifically allows them to do so.
The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act states that any foreigner who arrives in the USA, ""whether or not at a designated port of arrival,"" may apply for asylum. On Nov. 9, Trump tried to overrule that law, signing a presidential proclamation ending the ability of immigrants to request asylum if they enter the country illegally.
“The rule barring asylum for immigrants who enter the country outside a port of entry irreconcilably conflicts with the INA and the expressed intent of Congress,"" wrote Tigar, who was appointed by President Barack Obama. ""Whatever the scope of the President’s authority, he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden.”

Tigar issued a temporary restraining order, meaning the administration is forbidden from enforcing the new rules until the court case proceeds Dec. 19.
In a joint statement Tuesday, the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice said it was “absurd” that a collection of advocacy groups were able to sue the federal government to stop the asylum policy. The lawsuit was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of four groups that help immigrants.
The statement did not announce an appeal, but it made clear that the administration will fight Tigar’s ruling in court.
""We look forward to continuing to defend the Executive Branch's legitimate and well-reasoned exercise of its authority to address the crisis at our southern border,"" wrote Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman and Justice spokesman Steven Stafford.
The White House later issued a statement saying the “decision will open the floodgates, inviting countless illegal aliens to pour into our country on the American taxpayer’s dime.”
“This temporary injunction is yet another example of activist judges imposing their open borders policy preferences, which are rejected by the overwhelming majority of the American people, and interfering with the executive branch’s authority to administer the immigration system in a manner that ensures the Nation’s safety, security, and the rule of law,” the statement said.
As that legal process moves along, the ruling could have an immediate impact on members of the immigrant caravan of mostly Central Americans who are gathering in Tijuana to try to enter the USA.
Asylum is a form of protection granted to people who fear persecution in their home countries based on their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or their political opinion. From 2000 to 2016, the United States granted asylum to an average of 26,651 foreigners a year, according to Department of Homeland Security data.
The number of asylum applications has skyrocketed in recent years, from 5,000 in 2008 to 97,000 in 2018, mostly fueled by Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries.
Trump signed his directive after a monthlong attack against the immigrant caravan. He took to the campaign trail to warn about a looming ""invasion"" from caravan members who were criminals, gang members and ""Middle Easterners.""
To justify the move, he relied on a law that allows a president to suspend entry of foreigners if he signs a proclamation declaring them ""detrimental to the interests of the United States."" That's the same rationale he used to implement his controversial travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries. The first two versions of the travel ban were shot down in court, but the third was upheld by the Supreme Court.
Department of Justice lawyers cited the travel ban decision in the asylum lawsuit.
""Consistent with this explanation, the proclamation imposes limited measures to ameliorate the crisis along the southern border,"" the lawyers wrote.
The ACLU argued that the president's powers over immigration are not absolute and do not allow him to unilaterally cut off asylum for entire groups of people.
“The Court’s ruling makes clear that the President cannot override Congress, and will save lives,"" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney who brought the suit.
In court filings, the ACLU argued that the asylum restrictions were a direct challenge to the clear intention of Congress when it passed the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. The group cited a 1951 United Nations treaty signed by the United States that says ""refugees should not be penalized for their illegal entry"" because extreme situations sometimes ""require refugees to breach immigration rules.""
The ACLU used the example of the immigrant caravan, which is massing by the thousands in Tijuana, Mexico. Many members have said they want to present themselves at ports of entry to make their asylum request, but the majority cannot do so because U.S. officials at the San Ysidro Port of Entry can process only about 100 requests a day.
That has left caravan members stranded in Tijuana, a ""life-threatening"" situation that leaves them vulnerable to criminals who seek to take advantage of them, the ACLU attorneys wrote.
""Asylum seekers turned back from a port of entry have been raped, beaten, and kidnapped and held for ransom by cartel members waiting outside,"" they wrote. ""Asylum seekers who need to reach safety as quickly as possible thus often feel compelled to enter the United States along the border, outside of a port of entry, in order to escape their persecutors and the violence on Mexico’s side of the border.""
A separate lawsuit filed in Washington challenges another move by the Trump administration to limit asylum claims. In that case, the ACLU and other groups say the administration overstepped its legal limits when it issued rules barring immigrants from qualifying for asylum based on domestic abuse or gang violence.
Lawyers argued that case Monday, and the judge could issue a ruling any day."
3237,Trump shocks with racist new ad days before midterms',CNN (Web News),11/2/2018,,,https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/31/politics/donald-trump-immigration-paul-ryan-midterms/index.html,"(CNN) In the most racially charged national political ad in 30 years, President Donald Trump and the Republican Party accuse Democrats of plotting to help people they depict as Central American invaders overrun the nation with cop killers.
The new web video, tweeted by the President five days before the midterm elections , is the most extreme step yet in the most inflammatory closing argument of any campaign in recent memory.
The Trump campaign ad is the latest example of the President's willingness to lie and fear-monger in order to tear at racial and societal divides; to embrace demagoguery to bolster his own political power and the cause of the Republican midterm campaign.
The web video -- produced for the Trump campaign -- features Luis Bracamontes, a Mexican man who had previously been deported but returned to the United States and was convicted in February in the slaying of two California deputies.
""I'm going to kill more cops soon,"" a grinning Bracamontes is shown saying in court as captions flash across the screen reading ""Democrats let him into our country. Democrats let him stay.""
The ad recalls the notorious ""Willie Horton"" campaign ad financed by supporters of the George H.W. Bush campaign in the 1988 presidential election. Horton was a convicted murderer who committed rape while furloughed under a program in Massachusetts where Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis was governor.
The ad has since come to be seen as one of the most racially problematic in modern political history since it played into white fear and African-American stereotypes. It was regarded at the time as devastating to the Dukakis campaign.
Trump's web video, while just as shocking as the Horton spot, carries added weight since, unlike its 1988 predecessor, it bears the official endorsement of the leader of the Republican Party -- Trump -- and is not an outside effort. Given that Trump distributed it from his Twitter account, It also comes with all the symbolic significance of the presidency itself.
In a first reaction, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said the ad was a sign of desperation and suggested that Trump was losing the argument over health care that is at the center of the Democratic campaign.
""This is distracting, divisive Donald at his worst,"" Perez said on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time.""
""This is fear mongering. ... They have to fear monger and his dog whistle of all dog whistles is immigration. This has been Donald Trump's playbook for so long.""
""Family unification to invasion""
The Trump ad also flashes to footage of the migrant caravan of Central American asylum seekers that is currently in Mexico, which Trump says is preparing an invasion of the United States, implying that everyone in the column of people fleeing repression, poverty and economic blight is bent on murder and serious crime on US soil.
""Who else would Democrats let in?"" a caption asks.
A source close to the White House told CNN's Jim Acosta that the web ad was produced by Jamestown Associates for the Trump campaign for the midterms and was designed to fit into Trump's broader immigration push and to change the argument from ""family unification to invasion.""
""It's clearly working. We are all talking about it and not health care,"" the source said.
Trump has repeatedly warned that the caravan is laden with criminals or also includes Middle Eastern terrorists. He has offered no evidence for such claims, however, and even admitted last week there is no proof to support them.
The President has also often used racially suggestive rhetoric in his tweets and launched his presidential campaign in 2015 with a tirade against Mexicans. But he accuses the media, which points out his frequent falsehoods and flaming rhetoric, of being to blame for national divides.
Controversy over the new ad is certain to explode across the final days of the election in which polls suggest Democrats could take back the House of Representatives but Republicans could keep or even expand their Senate majority.
The new campaign web video was the culmination of a day on which the President staked out ever more extreme positions.
He took advantage of his role as commander-in-chief to promise to triple the number of troops to 15,000 that he has pledged to send to the southern border to repel the caravan -- which is still hundreds of miles away.
He also made a dubious claim of presidential power to reinforce his vow to change the Constitution on his own to end birthright citizenship that is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.
A sign of weakness?
Trump's combustible strategy is coinciding with an energetic final campaign swing featuring 11 rallies that opened in Florida on Wednesday night.
His increasingly inflammatory tactics are allowing him to refocus next Tuesday's election on his chosen issues, after a week of serial bombings and shootings that drowned out his closing argument.
Still, Democrats are increasingly confident five days out that they will take back the House, which they lost in the 2010 midterms.
""Up until today, I would have said, 'if the election were held today, we would win,"" former and possibly future speaker Nancy Pelosi said on ""The Late Show"" on CBS Tuesday.
""What now I'm saying is, we will win.""
One way of looking at Trump's increasingly frantic approach is that it is a sign of political weakness, because it seems to be a bid to drive up turnout in red state Senate races but might imply that tight House elections, that could be affected by such rhetoric, are out of reach.
However, everyone wrote Trump off in 2016, and it's possible his combative approach could defy pollsters again.
In another extraordinary development on Wednesday, the sitting President lashed out at the House speaker of his own party five days before an election, in a possible preview of a post-voting blame game.
Paul Ryan had dismissed the President's birthright gambit, but Trump told him in a tweet to do more to save the House.
""This is a great way to screw up the message a week before the election,"" a senior GOP aide told CNN's Acosta.
""First the birthright comment itself and now attacking the top Republican in Congress who is trying to save our majority.""
The President insisted he would not blame Ryan if Democrats won the House, though sounded less confident about Republican prospects in that chamber than in the Senate.
""I know we're doing well in the Senate and it looks like we're doing OK in the House. We're going to have to see,"" Trump told reporters.
Critics have accused Trump of abusing his power by sending troops to the southern border as part of a campaign stunt on a mission that has yet to be defined and he has implied will feature combat troops, but will in fact be made up of support forces.
But Defense Secretary James Mattis said Wednesday ""we don't do stunts"" and said the troops were being sent to offer ""practical support"" at the request of the Department of Homeland Security.
However, Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier of California accused Trump of squandering taxpayer funds in a desperate bid to buy votes, and predicted the American people would see through the plan.
""We are sending 10 to 15,000 troops, which means we are going to spend between $100 (million) and $150 million so he can have, I guess his surprise, his October surprise,"" she said on CNN's ""The Situation Room.""
Trump will Thursday press on with his pre-election blitz in Missouri, where he is trying to take out Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in the first of two rallies in the state in the next few days. Before Tuesday he will also visit West Virginia, Indiana twice, Montana, Florida again, Georgia, Tennessee and Ohio.
But two senior GOP sources told CNN's Jeff Zeleny that the President had been asked to steer clear of Arizona and Nevada amid concern he could hurt rather than help Republicans locked in tight Senate races."

Bracamontes first entered the country illegally in 1993, when he was 16. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office told the Bee that he was arrested in 1996 on marijuana possession related charges and deported on June 3, 1997.

He was arrested again on similar charges in May of 2001 and deported.
The Bee was unable to ascertain his exact re-entry date, but records show Bracamontes getting married in Maricopa County on Feb. 28, 2002, meaning he re-entered the country under the Bush administration. He was not deported again before the murder of two police officers in 2014.

4631,Democrats take the immigration bait',Washington Examiner,11/2/2018,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/democrats-take-the-immigration-bait,"In a clip that left-wing critics have compared to the infamous Willie Horton attack ad, President Trump blamed Democratic policies for allowing convicted cop killer Luis Bracamontes to illegally enter, re-enter, and stay in the country. The video draws broad and largely illogical comparisons between Bracamontes — who repeatedly entered the country illegally — and the vast migrant caravan from Honduras still thousands of miles away from the U.S.
On the facts, Trump is incorrect. Joe Arpaio, the Republican sheriff pardoned by Trump himself for criminal contempt of court, actually freed Bracamontes "" for reasons unknown"" after an arrest for drug charges in 1998 after he had illegally entered the U.S. multiple times. Technically, both Republican and Democratic failures led to Bracamontes' rampage, but rather than focusing on facts, Trump is betting on videos like these baiting Democrats into overstepping on immigration rhetoric in the final days before the midterms.
Democrats could easily counter Trump's false equivalencies and fearmongering with simple logic. Many cases like Bracamontes' stem from a failure of enforcement, not a lack of new laws.
Instead, however, they reach to embrace Trump's most extreme straw men, the ones meant to smear them.

When Trump issues overblown attacks toward a migrant caravan that border control will rightfully repel, the Left lurches instantly toward the ""racist"" label, implying that mere belief in American sovereignty and demand for an orderly, lawful immigration system is an expression of white supremacy. Certainly, a minority of Republicans impulsively fear immigration for racist or xenophobic reasons rather than economic or legal ones. But it will backfire if Democrats demonize everyone who wants to keep criminal immigrants out of the U.S.
Trump does himself no favors by attacking the bounds of legal immigration. But by ruthlessly and viscerally castigating violent illegal immigrants, Trump has baited the Left into calling border enforcement racist. That Trump's conflation was false was lost amid the initial headlines that the ad itself was racist. This reinforces for a lot of people that Democrats will continue to attack Republicans until we have open borders.
To be clear, it's doubtful that this is a part of some long-term strategy that Trump intricately designed to troll Democrats into embracing radical immigration policies. (They had already embraced those positions before former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was nominated — recall that she and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., both embraced a ""zero deportation"" position during the 2016 primaries.) But Trump knows how to read the room, and he's excelled in making the Left overreach. No matter how tonally questionable or factually wrong Trump's Bracamontes ad might be, it's a trap, and it's probably already worked."

“We’re going to be prepared. They are not coming into our country,” Mr. Trump said of the caravan of Central Americans now many hundreds of miles away and moving through Mexico.

President Trump said Wednesday that he is willing to send as many as 15,000 troops to the border in anticipation of a caravan of Central American migrants making its way north.
“As far as the caravan is concerned our military is out, we have about 5,000-8 [thousand], we’ll go up to anywhere between 10 [thousand] and 15,000 military personnel on top of border patrol, ICE and everybody else on the border,” he told reporters.

The Pentagon announced 5,200 active duty troops will be sent to the border on top of 2,100 National Guardsmen already assisting border patrol with tasks that do not include physically stopping illegal border crossers.
General Terrence O’Shaughnessy, the commander of U.S. Northern Command, said the number of troops would exceed 5,200 but did not specify by how much.
The caravan of about 3,500 mostly Honduran asylum seekers, who say they are fleeing crime and violence in their own gang-ridden countries, is still over 800 miles away. Most are traveling on foot, making it weeks before they would arrive at the U.S. border.

“The number of troops deployed will change each day as military forces flow into the operating area, but the initial estimate is that the DOD [Department of Defense] will have more than 7,000 troops supporting DHS [Department of Homeland Security] across California, Arizona and Texas,” the Pentagon said in a statement after Trump’s remarks.
The extra troops will “provide a range of assistance, including planning, engineering, transportation, logistics and medical support to the US Customs and Border Protection,” the Pentagon said.

“We don’t do stunts,” Defense Secretary James Mattis said when asked whether Trump’s inflated number of potential troops was a political stunt to rally supporters.
As Tuesday’s midterm congressional elections approach, Trump has raised the alarm about potentially dangerous elements mixed in with the refugees traveling in the caravan, an issue popular with his base.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he could send up to 15,000 troops to the U.S. border — nearly triple the 5,200 announced by the Defense Department, and nearly triple the number authorized to serve in Iraq.
Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House before departing for a campaign rally in Florida, Trump insisted that he is “not fear-mongering” by dispatching military forces to dissuade members of a migrant caravan from trying to come into the United States.

“We’ll go up to anywhere between 10 and 15,000 military personnel on top of border patrol, ICE, and everybody else at the border. Nobody’s coming in,” he said, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Immigration, he added, is a “very big and dangerous topic.”
Trump also claimed that the population of undocumented immigrants is two or three times the 2014 figure estimated by the Department of Homeland Security.
“We now have 25-30 million in this country illegally, not going to allow it, dangerous and unfair,” he said. “With that being said, I want people to come into our country, but they have to come legally and through merit.”
Homeland Security estimated that there were 12.1 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. in 2014, the most recent year for which official figures are available. A Yale study released last month suggested that there could be as many as 22 million undocumented immigrants in America, but its conclusions were challenged even by advocates for reducing immigration.
Just a week after George Soros, a Democratic activist and donor, received one of numerous mail bombs allegedly sent by a Trump supporter, the president said he thinks it’s possible Soros is funding the caravan of migrants — a claim for which there is no evidence.
“I wouldn't be surprised,” Trump said when asked whether Soros could be providing resources for the caravan. “A lot of people say yes.”"
2776,Trump Wants To Order End To Birthright Citizenship',HuffPost,10/30/2018,,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-executive-order-end-birthright-citizenship_us_5bd82b10e4b07427610ae4f4,"President Donald Trump said he’s considering an executive order to remove the right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to parents who aren’t citizens ― a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment that could likely be changed only through a constitutional amendment.
Trump said in an interview with “Axios on HBO” taped Monday that he could execute the change via executive order.
“It was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don’t,” Trump said. “You can definitely do it with an act of Congress. But now they’re saying I can do it just with an executive order.”
He said the right awarded to babies born as birthright Americans is “ridiculous” and that the system “has to end.”
Trump also falsely stated that the U.S. is “the only country in the world” that offers citizenship to those born here. More than 30 nations, including Canada and Mexico, have similar policies.
It’s not clear what the executive order would look like or when it would be proposed ― if Trump follows through at all, considering his tendency for pre-election bluster and warnings he has received from fellow Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (Wis.), who have said doing so would be outside the bounds the president’s authority.
All babies born in the U.S. are American citizens under the Constitution’s 14th Amendment, which cannot be changed by presidential order.
Changing that policy would dramatically reshape the U.S. ― effectively punishing the children of undocumented immigrants, whom Trump has vowed to remove from the country. Even if he doesn’t follow through or succeed, though, Trump’s vow to try aligns with other messaging and actions attacking undocumented immigrants ahead of the midterm elections next Tuesday.
Exclusive: Trump to terminate birthright citizenship https://t.co/ckg0vs4T9O — Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) October 30, 2018
An executive order challenging birthright citizenship would ensure a legal battle, in which most experts think the president would fail. The Supreme Court ruled in 1898’s U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark that a child born in the U.S. to immigrant parents was a citizen under the 14th Amendment.
“The president cannot erase the Constitution with an executive order, and the 14th Amendment’s citizenship guarantee is clear,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. “This is a transparent and blatantly unconstitutional attempt to sow division and fan the flames of anti-immigrant hatred in the days ahead of the midterms.”
Some Republicans ― including Ryan ― quickly shot down Trump’s idea. “You cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order,” the House speaker said Tuesday on WVLK Radio, according to Bloomberg News reporter Erik Wasson.
Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) criticized the president’s statement, calling instead for immigration reform “that makes our country more secure and reaffirms our wonderful tradition as a nation of immigrants.”
Another Republican, Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, also tweeted that such an executive order would not be possible.
A president cannot amend Constitution or laws via executive order. Concept of natural-born citizen in #14thAmendment derives from natural-born subject in Britain. Phrase “and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” excludes mainly foreign diplomats, who are not subject to U.S. laws. — Justin Amash (@justinamash) October 30, 2018
The are some experts who disagree. Axios cited John Eastman, a constitutional law professor at Chapman University and director of The Claremont Institute’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, who said the amendment has been misapplied and was not intended to apply to every person born in the U.S. regardless of parentage.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced Tuesday that he would introduce legislation “along the same lines as the proposed executive order from President Trump” to end birthright citizenship, a policy change he has supported for years. It’s unclear what his legislation would look like ― and he has previously suggested such a change would require a constitutional amendment.
“This policy is a magnet for illegal immigration, out of the mainstream of the developed world, and needs to come to an end,” Graham said in a statement on Tuesday.
Trump has long supported ending birthright citizenship, recommending in 2015 on the campaign trail that the country “start a process” to scrap it.
“I don’t think they have American citizenship and if you speak to some very, very good lawyers — and I know some will disagree — but many of them agree with me and you’re going to find they do not have American citizenship. Our country is going to hell,” Trump said then in an interview with CNN.
Every time you see a Caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our Country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic Immigration Laws!

The president has lasered in on immigration ahead of next week’s midterm elections, stoking fear about the caravan of migrants heading toward the U.S.-Mexico border from Central America. He has falsely claimed the caravan is stocked with criminals, gang members and Middle Eastern terrorists, and has threatened to cut off aid to Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, the countries where most of the migrants hail from.
He deployed 5,200 active-duty troops to the border on Monday in what officials of his administration described as a necessary national security measure.
This article has been updated with additional information about the 14th Amendment, as well as with responses to Trump’s proposal and information about Graham’s intended legislation.

4830,OPINION: Ending Birthright Citizenship Is No Panacea',Guest Writer - Right,10/30/2018,,,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/ending-birthright-citizenship-donald-trumps-immigration-plan/,"President Donald Trump delivers a speech in the White House East Room in Washington, D.C., June 29, 2018. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters )
According to Axios, President Trump is gearing up to sign an executive order that would, in their words, “remove the right to citizenship for babies of non-citizens born on U.S. soil.” There is some ambiguity in this formulation. Will the executive order in question limit birthright citizenship to the children of U.S. citizens, or will it extend citizenship to the children of lawful permanent residents, as in the case of most market democracies that have revised their birthright citizenship rules in recent decades? It is not clear from the video clip provided by Axios on HBO.

In truth, Trump’s response to reporter Jonathan Swan’s question seems rather off the cuff. At first, the president explains that while he once thought bringing an end to automatic birthright citizenship — presumably for the children of any class of non-citizens born in the U.S., whether legally present or otherwise — would require a constitutional amendment, he has since been persuaded that a statute would do, or even an executive order. Pressed by Swan as to whether such an executive order was in process of being drafted, Trump confidently replied that “it’s in the process, it’ll happen.” Will it happen, though? I’m skeptical.
First, I should stipulate that I have in the past argued for an amnesty for the long-settled unauthorized-immigrant population that would be accompanied by a constitutional amendment that would do two things: (a) grant Congress the authority to revise the rules around automatic birthright citizenship and (b) allow naturalized U.S. citizens who are otherwise eligible to serve as president. I’ve since changed my mind.
Advertisement
Though an amendment along these lines would have a hard time clearing the high hurdles we rightly put in the way of new constitutional amendments, it struck me as a tough-minded but ultimately fair way to address a serious and legitimate concern often raised by critics of an expansive amnesty: that such an amnesty would encourage further unauthorized inflows, future unauthorized immigrants would form families in the U.S. (including native-born citizen children), and these mixed-status households have long been among the most sympathetic cases, as most Americans are, for good reason, reluctant to divide families. If mixed-status households are a barrier to stringent enforcement, revising the rules around automatic birthright citizenship seemed like a legitimate solution — indeed, a solution that has in the past appealed to partisans of more open borders.
If you believe that opponents of an expansive amnesty ought to be anathematized, a sentiment often expressed by admissionists, addressing their concerns is an inciting thing to do in itself. I disagree. As the political scientists Matthew Wright, Morris Levy, and Jack Citrin have found, “opponents of legalization . . . often cast the issue in strict moral terms, regarding unlawful presence in the country as a blanket disqualification. To give any illegal immigrant a path to citizenship constitutes ‘amnesty,’ an act that transgresses respect for the law, rewards violators, and unjustly pushes aside those who have ‘played by the rules.’” Wright et al. are favorably disposed to legalization, as they call it, but they acknowledge that much of the opposition to it is driven by categorical moral judgments that can’t be reduced to, say, ethnic or racial bias, which is often cited as a driving force. (I discuss these and other related issues at greater length in Melting Pot or Civil War?) Revising automatic birthright citizenship so that it extends only to the children of citizens and lawful permanent residents is, in theory, a powerful signal that the next amnesty would be the last, not yet another amnesty in a long series of them that sap support for the rule of law.

Why have I changed my mind? It’s not because I believe that ending automatic birthright citizenship for the children of the unauthorized is offensive on its face. (As others have mentioned, many market democracies have revised their birthright-citizenship rules, and some of them have devised reasonable compromises, e.g., Australia’s 2007 citizenship law, which Peter Schuck and Rogers Smith recently discussed in National Affairs.) The short answer is that I am more confident we can make immigration enforcement much more effective via mandatory E-verify and focusing our efforts on recent violators, though it will require a political compromise, and I am more concerned about the issues raised by creating a large class of stateless persons. If we can greatly diminish future unauthorized flows, as I believe we can, we can shrink the number of mixed-status households. If we fail to do so, the countries of origin of unauthorized immigrants might refuse to grant citizenship to the offspring of their nationals, which would, I fear, precipitate a serious and lasting problem. It is never wise to give a foreign government that much power to sow chaos in our country. That is why getting enforcement right is so essential.

To return to President Trump’s remarks, I find it hard to believe the Trump White House would pursue an executive order ending automatic birthright citizenship for the children of the unauthorized. For one, the practical realities of implementing such a rule would be enormously complex, and it would face serious legal challenges right from the start. My impression is that this is yet another attempt by the president to telegraph that he takes controlling immigration seriously. The danger, however, is that Trump will further exacerbate the “thermostatic” reaction to his immigration rhetoric, i.e., the fact that the more hawkish the president comes across on the issue, the more moderates and liberals seem to take a more dovish line.

Consider the following from political scientist Daniel Hopkins, a leading expert on public opinion on immigration: “With Trump taking a more hard-line stance than Romney, we might have expected some Americans to likewise shift against a pathway to citizenship, but that’s not what happened,” observed Hopkins. “Instead, Republicans and Democrats alike became more pro-pathway between 2012 and 2016, and much of that uptick occurred during the 2016 campaign.

Trump told ""Axios on HBO"" that he has run the idea of ending birthright citizenship by his counsel and plans to proceed with the highly controversial move, which certainly will face legal challenges.

And it has to end."" (More than 30 countries, most in the Western Hemisphere, provide birthright citizenship.) ""It's in the process. It'll happen ... with an executive order.""
The president expressed surprise that ""Axios on HBO"" knew about his secret plan: ""I didn't think anybody knew that but me. I thought I was the only one. ""
Behind the scenes: ""Axios on HBO"" had been working for weeks on a story on Trump’s plans for birthright citizenship, based on conversations with several sources, including one close to the White House Counsel’s office.
The legal challenges would force the courts to decide on a constitutional debate over the 14th Amendment, which says:
""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""
Be smart: Few immigration and constitutional scholars believe it is within the president's power to change birthright citizenship, former U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services chief counsel Lynden Melmed tells Axios.
But some conservatives have argued that the 14th Amendment was only intended to provide citizenship to children born in the U.S. to lawful permanent residents — not to unauthorized immigrants or those on temporary visas.
that the 14th Amendment was only intended to provide citizenship to children born in the U.S. to lawful permanent residents — not to unauthorized immigrants or those on temporary visas. John Eastman, a constitutional scholar and director of Chapman University's Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, told ""Axios on HBO"" that the Constitution has been misapplied over the past 40 or so years. He says the line ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" refers to people with full, political allegiance to the U.S. — such as green card holders and citizens.
Michael Anton, a former national security official in the Trump administration, recently took up this argument in the Washington Post.
Anton said that Trump could, via executive order, ""specify to federal agencies that the children of noncitizens are not citizens"" simply because they were born on U.S. soil. (It’s not yet clear whether Trump will take this maximalist argument, though his previous rhetoric suggests there’s a good chance.)

(It’s not yet clear whether Trump will take this maximalist argument, though his previous rhetoric suggests there’s a good chance.) But others — such as Judge James C. Ho, who was appointed by Trump to Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans — say the line in the amendment refers to the legal obligation to follow U.S. laws, which applies to all foreign visitors (except diplomats) and immigrants. He has written that changing how the 14th Amendment is applied would be ""unconstitutional.""
Between the lines: Until the 1960s, the 14th Amendment was never applied to undocumented or temporary immigrants, Eastman said.
Between 1980 and 2006, the number of births to unauthorized immigrants — which opponents of birthright citizenship call ""anchor babies"" — skyrocketed to a peak of 370,000, according to a 2016 study by Pew Research. It then declined slightly during and following the Great Recession.

It then declined slightly during and following the Great Recession. The Supreme Court has already ruled that children born to immigrants who are legal permanent residents have citizenship. But those who claim the 14th Amendment should not apply to everyone point to the fact that there has been no ruling on a case specifically involving immigrants in the country illegally or those with temporary legal status.
The bottom line: If Trump follows through on the executive order, ""the courts would have to weigh in in a way they haven't,"" Eastman said.

4144,Congress Must Act to Deter Future Caravans',National Review,10/27/2018,,,https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/10/central-american-caravan-illegal-immigration-congress-national-sovereignty/,"Central American migrants walk along the road in Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico, October 26, 2018. (Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters)
It’s the only way to meet the challenge to our national sovereignty posed by illegal immigration.
King Leonidas had his 300. President Trump has his 800. That’s the number of soldiers Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has ordered to the southern border to greet the caravan of illegal immigrants originating from Honduras. The band of families and singles, traveling en masse to avoid exploitation by smugglers and coyotes, now numbers 10,000 souls, according to one report. It may take them weeks to reach the United States. A second caravan is already taking shape behind the first. It won’t be the last.

An unauthorized march on a border — any border — is a challenge to national sovereignty. And it is precisely the idea of sovereignty that one of the groups supporting the caravan, Pueblo Sin Fronteras, wants to undermine. The confrontation is all the more emphatic when the men at the head of the column bear the flag not of the country they seek to enter but that of their homeland. Americans who oppose illegal immigration and are concerned at the mounting crisis in our border states, where thousands of family units and unaccompanied children are detained as an inundated bureaucracy decides their fates, look to Trump, Mattis, and the Army for relief.
Prepare to be disappointed. The soldiers aren’t going to the border to stop the caravan. They’re going to assist Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Health and Human Services, and other authorities as they take in the newcomers. There is little the government can do to turn back the tide. Why? Because the same rule of law challenged by illegal immigration also incentivizes and protects the illegal immigrants within the caravan. It’s a paradox — one inflaming this most polarizing of issues at a moment of political decision.

The military can’t solve the problem. But Congress can. Only the legislative branch has the authority to close the loopholes through which the most recent illegal migration has passed: a portion of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act that limits the ability of law enforcement to repatriate swiftly unaccompanied children from noncontiguous (read: Central American) nations; the 1997 Flores settlement that put a ceiling on how long the government can detain these children; and the “credible fear” standard by which illegal immigrants may request asylum proceedings simply by saying they are afraid to return to Tegucigalpa or Quetzaltenango.
These three provisions, along with changing political conditions in Central America, have transformed the character of illegal immigration. The American public still conceives of the illegal immigrant as a young, single male from Mexico looking for economic opportunity in the United States. That is no longer the case. The population of Mexicans living illegally in the United States has declined in recent years because of rising living standards in Mexico and U.S. immigration officials becoming quite skilled at apprehension and repatriation. The new illegal immigration isn’t made up of single males looking to become day laborers. It’s families harassed by gangs and encouraged by left-wing politicians to flee to safety — and perhaps join family — in the north.

Which is why, though the number of illegal immigrants from Mexico fell, the overall figure stabilized. (And that population could be much larger than we think.) At the beginning of the 21st century, 98 percent of the individuals Border Patrol apprehended were from Mexico. Today, 60 percent are from Central America.
Our first taste of the changing nature of illegal immigration — and harbinger of our Europeanized politics of national identity — was the child migration of 2014. The inauguration of Donald Trump seems to have deterred illegal border crossings. Not for long. By spring 2018, the first caravan was on its way. This latest wave grew in strength.
Advertisement
Its very nature makes it that much more difficult to counteract. Not just because there are children involved, but because of our national self-image as the refuge of free peoples. The humanitarian instinct is a powerful force in American immigration policy: Look at the backlash to family separations resulting from the administration’s zero-tolerance policy earlier this year as well as to the State Department’s cap on refugee admissions. Our moral imagination asks us to put ourselves in the shoes of these families, denizens of failed states that offer neither personal nor economic security, lured here by the promise of a better future, and encouraged by cynical politicians and non-governmental organizations eager to strike a blow against “The Empire” and its president.
But humanitarianism only gets you so far. In this case, our desire to help strangers unintentionally contributed to a mounting crisis that benefits no nation. And to which we have not responded adequately. Yes, calling in the Army is fine. The agencies on the ground need help. What they ultimately require, however, is congressional action.

Amend the 2008 law to accelerate repatriations, address Flores in legislation that permits indefinite detention of family units, and tighten the standards for asylum. Provide more money for beds, judges, and bureaucrats to speed up legal proceedings. Announce forcefully and unequivocally that it is the citizens of the United States, acting through their elected representatives, who decide the conditions and criteria under which individuals are allowed to enter this nation.
And maybe get serious about building that wall while you’re at it.

6793,TRUMP WORRIED MIGRANT CARAVAN IS NOT DOING ENOUGH TO RILE UP THE BASE BEFORE THE MIDTERMS',Vanity Fair,10/27/2018,,,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/trump-caravan-border,"Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, was expected to sign papers in the coming days to send the troops. They will include engineers to help with the construction of tents and fencing, doctors for medical support, and potentially some personnel to operate drones along the border, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the deployment had not yet been finished.
American immigration law says that people arriving at ports of entry on the United States border have a right to seek asylum, as do those apprehended crossing the border without authorization, if they are able to demonstrate a “credible fear” of returning home. But President Border Wall, who has no idea how the law actually works, has painted those fleeing violence and persecution, and those simply thumbing their noses at immigration laws for yuks, as one and the same. “To those in the Caravan, turnaround, [sic] we are not letting people into the United States illegally,” Trump wrote on Twitter Thursday. “Go back to your Country and if you want, apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing!” (As many have pointed out, it’s unlikely that the Spanish-speaking asylum seekers have the Wi-Fi necessary to read this message, which almost makes it appear as though it was actually addressed to his base.)
Human-rights and immigrant advocacy groups have unsurprisingly panned Trump’s transparent attempt to instill fear in voters just before the midterm elections. “The approach of a caravan of migrants that includes refugees fleeing persecution and violence is not a crisis, but President Trump is yet again spreading hatred and fear, hoping to score political points by making Americans fear refugees,” Mike Breen, the chief executive of Human Rights First, told The New York Times. Meanwhile, when asked if “there was any scenario [in which] people [who] force their way across the border could be shot at,” Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News, “We do not have any intention right now to shoot at people,” emphasis ours, because that sure sounds like a roundabout way of saying Some people might get shot—who knows!

6608,Trump is considering a new \xe2\x80\x9ctravel ban\xe2\x80\x9d aimed at the migrant caravan',Vox,10/26/2018,,,https://www.vox.com/2018/10/26/18025768/trump-migrant-caravan-ban-asylum,"The Trump administration is reportedly considering using executive action to prevent people traveling in the migrant “caravan” from presenting themselves for asylum at the US-Mexico border.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are developing a plan that mimics the “travel ban” from 2017, the San Francisco Chronicle and other media outlets reported Thursday night: President Donald Trump would issue a proclamation preventing a certain “class” of people from being allowed to enter the US. It’s not yet clear how that “class” would be defined, but it would target either the “caravan” in particular or asylum-seekers more broadly.
It’s legal to seek asylum without papers, and the US government is obligated under international law not to send anyone back to a country where they are at risk of persecution due to race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or membership in a social group.
But the Trump administration appears to be laying the groundwork for a plan that would simply bar people from entering the US — presumably keeping Central American asylum-seekers on the Mexican side of the border.
The US government has already been restricting access at official US border crossings and requiring would-be asylum-seekers to wait before being allowed to enter, claiming space constraints at ports of entry.
The “caravan” of about 5,000 people, which originally set off from Honduras on October 12, is still weeks from the US-Mexico border. It is not going to arrive before the November 6 midterm elections, and it is already shrinking as caravan members decide to apply for asylum in Mexico or return to their home countries instead.
However, the Trump administration is in overdrive to respond to what Trump has called a “National Emergency.” The US is already sending 800 troops to the US-Mexico border to provide logistical support for Customs and Border Protection agents.
The proposal (or proposals) reported Thursday night are still under discussion. It’s not clear when or if the White House will act on them. If Trump does take executive action to ban entries in the name of stopping the caravan, though, it’s almost certainly going to attract another court challenge over executive authority to stop people from entering the US — and may well prevent many, many Central American asylum-seekers who aren’t in the caravan from being allowed into the US to make their case.
Here’s what we know:
The plan reported by the San Francisco Chronicle (which matches a plan Vox has heard is in the works) would have two parts.
The first step in the plan would be to publish a regulation barring asylum claims from anyone who’s subject to a presidential ban issued under section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. That provision, also used in the travel ban, allows the president to “suspend the entry” of a “class of aliens” if he determines their entry would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States.”
a regulation barring asylum claims from anyone who’s subject to a presidential ban issued under section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. That provision, also used in the travel ban, allows the president to “suspend the entry” of a “class of aliens” if he determines their entry would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States.” The Trump administration has already been working on such a regulation as part of a broader package of asylum regulations being reviewed at DOJ and DHS.
Instead of going through the normal process (which takes several months), however, the regulation barring asylum for banned immigrants would be issued as an “interim final rule” — allowing the government to enforce it while it goes through the review process.
The regulation, which could be issued as soon as Friday, would not change anything on its own. It would have to be issued before the ban itself went into effect.
As early as Monday or Tuesday, the president could sign a ban that refused entry to some class of people under the 212(f) provision. At that point, those people would also not be allowed to apply for asylum.
But there are still a lot of unknowns in this process. Here’s what we don’t know:
Whether other, broader executive actions are also being considered. The New York Times reported that plans were under development to “close the southern border” — which implies refusing not only asylum-seekers, but all people or goods seeking to cross from Mexico into the US. This is a much broader proposal than the one the San Francisco Chronicle reported on (and the one Vox has heard about). It’s not at all clear what the legal vehicle for such a move would be.
Exactly who would be banned under this plan. The ban could cover only members of the caravan currently traveling through southern Mexico (although it’s not clear how the government would know who exactly had been part of the caravan and who wasn’t). Alternatively, it could cover all asylum-seekers from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador — the “Northern Triangle” countries driving asylum-seekers to the US — or even all asylum-seekers generally.
How much advance notice the government would give before implementing the ban, and when it would go into effect. Thousands of Central American asylum seekers present themselves to US officials every month. A broad ban would be far harder to enforce than even the first version of the travel ban in January 2017 — whose rollout was famously disastrous. Without training time, this ban could make that one look like a smooth and efficient government operation.
Who, if anyone, has signed off on this plan, and whether it will ultimately be approved.
Whether the ban could survive a legal challenge. In upholding the final version of Trump’s travel ban in June in the case Trump v. Hawaii, the Supreme Court (in an opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts) made it clear that the president’s power to ban immigrants under 212(f) is extremely broad. At the same time, however, the opinion pointed to the national security reasons offered for the ban, and the careful process by which it was drafted, as evidence that it was legitimate government policy and not just driven by the whims of Trump.
It’s hard to imagine a caravan ban would look as well-thought-out — not least because there’s no evidence that anyone in the caravan poses a security threat, or that the caravan, should it arrive at the border, wouldn’t just line up at a port of entry to seek asylum legally.
The right to seek asylum isn’t just a matter of international law but of the 1980 Refugee Act. Whether US law allows a president to refuse someone the power to seek asylum through a proclamation isn’t entirely clear. It’s a question that the Supreme Court will almost certainly have to consider if this plan is put into effect."
4752,Trump mulls plan to bar entry of all migrants at US-Mexico border',Fox News (Online),10/26/2018,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-mulls-plan-to-bar-entry-of-all-migrants-at-us-mexico-border,"President Trump is considering a sweeping executive order that would block migrants, including asylum seekers, from entering the U.S. at the southern border in a bid to stop the caravan traveling north through Mexico.
The White House, if it goes ahead with the measure, would issue new regulations restricting certain migrants from seeking asylum. The rules would effectively block most if not all the migrants who are taking part in the caravan, Politico first reported.
Fox News has learned the proposal originated out of the White House and is one of several being considered. No final decision has been made.
“The Administration is considering a wide range of administrative, legal and legislative options to address the Democrat-created crisis of mass illegal immigration. No decisions have been made at this time. Nor will we forecast to smugglers or caravans what precise strategies will or will not be deployed,” a White House official said.
The order would be akin to Trump's previous aggressive immigration-blocking executive orders, such as the travel ban aimed at halting people from some Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.
Any attempt to block the entry of Central American migrants is likely to prompt legal challenges, though Trump is likely emboldened following a Supreme Court ruling earlier this summer that affirmed the president’s right to bar the entry of migrants who “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.”
The plan for the executive order comes just in the final stretch before the upcoming midterm elections, with Trump trying to make the issue of caravan the defining topic as voters head to the polls.
""Every time you see a caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws!"" Trump wrote in a tweet Monday. ""Remember the midterms!""
Hundreds of U.S. troops are also set to make their way to the southern border to help Homeland Security and the National Guard as the caravan pushes north.
An official told Fox News on Thursday roughly 800 soldiers will be sent to the area to offer “logistical support,"" including providing tents and vehicles.
It’s not immediately clear which units are being tasked with the mission as details are still being finalized. There are currently 2,100 National Guard troops on the southern border assisting Homeland Security.
Democrats, while previously outspoken regarding Trump’s immigration policies, are staying largely silent on the issue, instead preferring to remain focused on tackling the GOP on issues like health care, saying it’s the winning issue this election cycle.
DEMOCRATS AVOID SPARRING WITH TRUMP ON CARAVAN AS MIDTERM NEARS
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrats in the country, slammed Trump in a statement earlier this week regarding the caravan of migrants, saying the president is “desperate” to change the conversation because “health care is the number one issue Americans care about.”
According to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey published last week, which surveyed people since the beginning of the caravan earlier this month, the issue of immigration isn’t the top concern for voters. It ranks below health care, which has consistently been viewed as the most important issue. Other key issues have been the economy, jobs and policies concerning gun rights.

The Trump administration is considering an order to block the entry of migrants at the southern border, using the same authority as its earlier travel ban, a person familiar with the matter said, as thousands of Central Americans make their way toward the U.S.
The action, if implemented, would effectively bar those seeking asylum from entering the country. President Donald Trump is weighing a range of options designed to prevent undocumented migrants from crossing the U.S.-Mexican frontier, said a White House official familiar with the discussions. Both people spoke on condition of anonymity as no final decision has been made.
The travel ban, announced shortly after Trump took office in 2017, affected people from seven countries, five of them with Muslim majorities. The executive order now being looked at would deny asylum claims based on national security concerns, and would give broad authority to officials at the border, the person said.
The New York Times reported late Thursday that the administration was considering an order that would bar migrants, including those requesting asylum, who try to enter the country from Mexico, a significant escalation of presidential power on immigration policy.
Midterm Elections
The White House official wouldn’t confirm the Times report and others, saying that several legal, executive and legislative remedies were on the table.
Trump has made undocumented immigration a front-burner issue in the weeks before the midterm congressional elections on Nov. 6. He’s blamed Democrats for the so-called caravan of Central American migrants headed through Mexico after starting off in Honduras.
“Every time you see a Caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our Country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats,” Trump said Oct. 22 on Twitter, one of three tweets this week referencing the caravan.
Trump also claimed that “ unknown Middle Easterners” were blended in with the thousands of Central Americans, but later said that there was no evidence to support that assertion.
The Trump administration plans to send at least 800 additional troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a third person familiar with the deliberations.
The Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security confirmed late Friday plans for U.S. Northern Command to send more troops to the border, without saying how many.
In a joint statement, the departments said soldiers will help with planning, engineering support -- such as “temporary barriers, barricades, and fencing” -- and support for Custom and Border Protection agents including providing them with aircraft, medical teams, temporary housing and protective equipment.
Where Now for Migrant Caravan as Trump Tweets Threats: QuickTake
The president has also threatened to cut off U.S. aid to three Central American countries -- Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador -- over the migrants heading toward the U.S.
‘Racism-Driven Cruelty’
The Times article, citing sources it didn’t identify, said that details of the possible executive order were still in the planning stages and that whatever emerged was sure to be met with legal challenges.
Officials at the National Immigration Law Center, which participated in the earlier legal challenge to Trump’s travel ban, said it is prepared to fight a new order if Trump moves ahead. Marielena Hincapie, executive director of the center, said that the White House’s consideration of such action shows that Trump’s “racism-driven cruelty has no bounds.”
“We will use every tool to stop Trump from undermining the Constitution and international laws and from instituting his administration’s agenda to impose a Latin ban in any form,” Hincapie said in a statement.
American Civil Liberties Union immigration rights director Omar Jadwat said it was “disgraceful” that the administration “would even consider what’s being reported.”
‘Moral Failure’
“It would mean refusing to protect people who can prove they are fleeing persecution,” Jadwat said in a statement. “That would be a huge moral failure and any plan along these lines will be subject to intense legal scrutiny.”
But Peter Spiro, an immigration law professor at Temple University, said that courts could uphold the president’s potential actions. In June, a sharply divided Supreme Court upheld Trump’s ban on travel from the seven countries. The restrictions indefinitely bar more than 150 million people from entering the U.S.
“Most experts would agree about the restrictions now being contemplated: they make no sense from a policy perspective,” Spiro said. “But just because a ban on asylum applicants would be stupid and cruel doesn’t mean the Supreme Court would strike it down.”
The troops that Trump is sending to the border would join 2,100 National Guard troops who were previously deployed to perform support duties for Department of Homeland Security personnel.
Trump said on Twitter on Thursday that he was “bringing out the military for this National Emergency” and promised immigrants unlawfully crossing the border “will be stopped!”
Earlier: Trump Gambles With Immigration Attack to Spur Midterm Voters
Cutting aid to the Central American countries is complicated. Much of the money for El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras was appropriated by Congress in the form of anti-corruption and good-governance programs. Those initiatives have broad support from lawmakers, who’ve already promised to put up a fight should Trump try to make good on his threat.
The migrants began crossing into southern Mexico on Oct. 20, avoiding that country’s migration authorities and federal police by jumping off the border bridge crossing the Suchiate River, or by crossing the river in improvised rafts made of tires and boards, according to images from El Financiero Bloomberg TV.
Under standard U.S. procedures, the migrants, assuming they reached and attempted to cross the U.S. border, would be detained for not having the required documents, and asked whether they’re afraid of returning to their home.
A person who answered “no” would not be admitted into the U.S. One who expressed fear of persecution or torture would be interviewed by an asylum officer to establish whether there is credible fear of persecution.
Michael J. Bars, a spokesman for the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in an email that the “extremely low bar” for establishing credible fear allows economic migrants to abuse the system by posing as asylum seekers, then disappear before their court dates to live illegally in the U.S.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is planning to dispatch at least 800 active duty troops to the southern border at the direction of a president who has sought to transform fears about immigration into electoral gains in the midterms as a caravan of thousands of migrants makes its way through Mexico.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is expected to sign an order sending the troops to the border, bolstering National Guard forces already there, an official said Thursday. The action comes as President Donald Trump has spent recent days calling attention to the caravan of Central Americans slowly making their way by foot into southern Mexico, but still more than 1,000 miles from U.S. soil.

Trump, who made fear about immigrants a major theme of his 2016 election campaign, has been eager to make it a top issue heading into the Nov. 6 midterm elections, which will determine control of Congress. The president and senior White House officials have long believed the issue is key to turning out his base of supporters.
The additional troops would provide logistical and other support to the Border Patrol, said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a plan that had not been finalized and formally announced.
It’s not unusual for the National Guard to help with border security. Active duty troops, however, are rarely deployed within the United States except for domestic emergencies like hurricanes or floods. Fears of militarizing the border were fanned by a May 1997 incident in which a Marine on a counter-narcotics mission shot to death an 18-year-old who was herding goats in Redford, Texas.
Troops being sent at Trump’s direction would not be on armed security missions. They would assist the Border Patrol by providing things such as vehicles, tents and equipment. There already are about 2,000 National Guard members there under a previous Pentagon arrangement.
Trump has used the caravan to bolster his election-season warnings that the U.S. is being infiltrated by illegal immigrants “pouring across the border,” whom he has painted with a sinister brush.
He has claimed, without any apparent basis in fact, that “Middle Easterners” were among the group. At rallies and on Twitter, Trump has tried to portray the Democrats as pro-illegal immigration, even claiming, with no evidence, that Democrats organized the caravan.

He tweeted Thursday that, “Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the border” and said he was using the military to respond to what he called a “National Emergency.”
The migrants in the sprawling caravan — once estimated by the United Nations to number more than 7,000 — are hoping to make it to the United States. Most are Hondurans, seeking to escape poverty and violence, and include families with children.
The caravan swelled dramatically soon after crossing the Mexican border on Oct. 19, but sickness, fear and police harassment have whittled down its numbers.
Trump tweeted a direct message to the migrants Thursday, urging them to return home.
“To those in the Caravan, turnaround,” he wrote. “We are not letting people into the United States illegally. Go back to your Country and if you want, apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing!”
The migrants have largely been disconnected from news reports about them. When asked about Trump’s tweets, they have generally responded that he should stop attacking them and said they would keep heading north.
Candy Guillermo, a 37-year-old migrant in the caravan who had heard about the plan to deploy troops, was surprised she and the children in group would be considered a threat. “Trump should be more humanitarian,” she said. “We only want to give our kids a better future.”
Migrants who do reach the U.S. border can claim asylum under U.S. and international law. Those who clear an initial screening are often released until their cases are decided in immigration court, which can take several years.
The U.S. had 331,700 asylum claims in 2017, more than any country in the world, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency. That’s nearly double the asylum claims the U.S. fielded in 2015 and nearly quadruple the claims in 2013.
Trump ordered the deployment of the National Guard earlier this year to respond to a spike in illegal crossings. Those troops are under the control of state governors and are limited to support roles such as providing surveillance.
The planned deployment of active duty troops is in response to a request from the Department of Homeland Security, which manages the Border Patrol, a U.S. official said.
DHS asked for help in various forms, the official said, including air transport and other logistical assistance. It was not immediately clear why active duty forces were sought because National Guard troops can perform the same functions. Earlier this year Mattis authorized Pentagon funding for up to 4,000 National Guard troops on the border and thus far only a little over 2,000 have been used.
Federal law prohibits the use of active duty service members for law enforcement inside the U.S. unless specifically authorized by Congress.
Trump seemed to hint at the troop announcement to a rally in Wisconsin on Wednesday. “Wait’ll you see what happens over the next couple of weeks. You’re going to see a very secure border,” he said. “You just watch.”

2211,Pentagon to send active-duty troops to U.S.-Mexico border',Washington Times,10/25/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/25/pentagon-deploy-more-troops-us-mexico-border/,"The Trump administration will send about 800 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border ahead of the illegal immigrant caravan, a defense official confirmed Thursday, following through on President Trump’s pledge.
Most of the troops will be active-duty Army soldiers who specialize in support operations such as logistics and engineering. Medical staff also will be part of the deployment, with an Air Force contingent assisting in aerial evacuations.
They will join more than 2,000 National Guard troops already in the region, deployed in April as a previous caravan was testing the border.
It was not clear Thursday what operational gains will come from adding active-duty troops to the mix, but it makes good on a declaration Mr. Trump made over the past week that he wanted to mobilize the regular military, not just the Guard.
“You’re going to see a very secure border. You just watch,” Mr. Trump told supporters at a political rally in Wisconsin Wednesday night. “The military is ready. They’re all set.”
Turning to Pentagon brass to solve problems has been a theme for Mr. Trump during his time in office.
The Guard troops he asked for earlier this year are helping with surveillance to detect illegal crossings and with clerical and mechanical work, with a goal of freeing border agents and officers to get into the field.
Guard troops are not involved in patrolling or arresting illegal immigrants or smugglers.
From the description officials have given of the latest deployment, it does not appear that will change.
That makes it unlikely the infusion of personnel will deter the migrant caravan streaming north through Mexico.
While public estimates say the caravan has at least 5,000 people, Mexican officials put it closer to 3,630, most of them from Honduras.
They left their home country two weeks ago and made it to Guatemala. Some broke into Mexico, while others are still in Guatemala trying to figure out their path forward.
Guatemalan officials rescued seven unaccompanied children who were being smuggled inside the migrant caravan, Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group, reported Thursday.
The group said the smugglers have been arrested and the children have been taken into custody by authorities and are being given welfare checks.
“This caravan deal presents an opportunity for incredible criminal activity,” said Chris Farrell, Judicial Watch’s director of investigations, who returned from Central America, where he spent time tracking the caravan.
He said he saw among the caravan men with Gothic-script “MS” tattoos, which would likely make them members of the violent MS-13 gang that Mr. Trump has said infiltrated the caravan.
He also saw what Border Patrol agents refer to as “special interest aliens” — those from countries outside the usual set of nations that send economic migrants.
Mr. Trump has said Middle Easterners in the caravan could be trouble.
If the caravan follows the lead of previous migrants from Central America, many will make asylum claims in the U.S. If they pass their initial screening, they will be admitted and likely released into the community to await a full hearing. Most will then disappear into the shadows, not bothering to follow through on their cases, authorities said during the April caravan.
The latest announcement of a troop deployment angered liberal activists, who called it a “desperate political stunt.”
“All Americans should be concerned about Trump’s increasingly frantic attempts to stir up animosity and incite violence against people of color, the media and his political opponents,” said Heidi Hess, co-director of CREDO Action.
Republicans, though, said the president was right to stiffen America’s response to the caravan.
“President Trump’s use of military force to protect America’s southern border is mandated by the commander in chief’s oath of office and constitutional duties,” said Rep. Mo Brooks, Alabama Republican.

4770,"Migrant caravan overwhelms Mexican authorities, moves on toward U.S.'",Washington Times,10/22/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/oct/21/migrant-caravan-pushes-into-mexico/,"The combined efforts of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and the U.S. were not enough to deter thousands of migrants who broke through barricades or swam into Mexico over the weekend, defying their home government’s calls for them to return and America’s warnings that their journey is futile.
Local leaders say hundreds of people who were part of the migrant caravan have given up their journey and are returning to their homes in Honduras and Guatemala. But perhaps 2,000 others entered Mexico illegally and vowed to cross that country, with the U.S. their goal.
Saying they weren’t content to wait for authorities to process and admit them in smaller groups, they overcame Mexican police who had been deployed to try to prevent the mass entry.
“We are going to reach the United States,” Erasmo Duarte, a migrant from Danli, Honduras, told The Associated Press. “We couldn’t wait because we had already waited too long and they only told us lies.”
Local news reports said once the migrants broke into Mexico, authorities there did not try to stop them. They left the migrants to prepare for the long journey across the country and to the U.S., where they plan to test the administration’s resolve.
President Trump on Sunday called the caravan a “disgrace” and blamed Democrats, federal courts and the migrants themselves.
“Full efforts are being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our [southern] border,” he tweeted. “People have to apply for asylum in Mexico first, and if they fail to do that, the U.S. will turn them away. The courts are asking the U.S. to do things that are not doable!”
Earlier in the weekend, Mr. Trump told reporters that he would send the military — and not just the National Guard — to the border if need be.
That plan would create a number of legal entanglements, though the president’s suggestion of a military option served to underscore his frustration with the situation and the lack of tools the U.S. has to counter determined migrants willing to make the trip and prepared to demand asylum, whether deserving or not.
Mexican authorities have taken a firmer stand against this caravan than the one that traversed the country in the spring — partly at the urging of Mr. Trump, who threatened to cancel the trade deal he is planning with Mexico unless officials block entry.
The Mexican government said the migrants would have to apply for entry, and only those with passports would be granted travel permission. Others who had a case for asylum would be allowed to make it.
Those restrictions were too onerous for many migrants, for whom Mexico is a hurdle to be surmounted as they reach for their real goal of taking jobs in the U.S. or reuniting with family already in the country — usually illegally.
The caravan began in San Pedro Sula, a Honduran city known as one of the most violent places in the world. It grew steadily as it made its way through Honduras and Guatemala to as many as 5,000 people by some estimates.
Caravan members say they are fleeing gang violence at home and looking for jobs in the U.S. — neither of which has traditionally been enough reason to win asylum on its own.
But thanks to court rulings and generous U.S. laws, it’s easy to make an unworthy claim, and migrants making those claims are usually released into the interior of the U.S., where they disappear into the shadows with an estimated 11 million other illegal immigrants.
Mr. Trump has been complaining about that situation for months. His administration has suggested several changes, including holding illegal immigrants until they can be deported and allowing bogus asylum claims to be denied at a quicker pace.
Those proposals have not gotten traction among congressional Democrats, who view those changes as anti-immigrant.
Migration is just as controversial in Mexico, where President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he will ask Mr. Trump to pony up more money to try to build Central American society and create jobs in Mexico, hoping to stem the flow of people to the U.S.
He said the migrants’ rights must be protected as they break into Mexico and head north.
Amnesty International also called on Latin American governments to let people enter and apply for protections.
“The Mexican government should put the human rights of the caravan members at the heart of the response and not let the U.S. Trump administration’s pressure prevent it from fulfilling its international obligations,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, the organization’s director for the region.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen warned Sunday that the illegal immigrant caravan could be exploited by the cartels that control most of the illegal flow of people through Latin America.
The ease of entering the U.S. is a selling point for the cartels, which control the drug and human smuggling routes and require payment of a “mafia fee” just to cross the U.S.-Mexico boundary line.
Court records show that fee typically runs from $1,000 to $2,000. That doesn’t include thousands of dollars in other fees that cover foot guides, drivers, stash houses and the rest of the illegal journey.
“While we closely monitor the caravan crisis, we must remain mindful of the transnational criminal organizations and other criminals that prey on the vulnerabilities of those undertaking the irregular migration journey,” Ms. Nielsen said in a statement Sunday.
She repeated U.S. backing for the governments that have tried to stem the flow.
“We fully support the efforts of Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico, as they seek to address this critical situation and ensure a safer and more secure region,” the secretary said.

2263,Trump Threatens to Cut Aid to Central American Nations Over Migrant Caravan',Wall Street Journal - News,10/22/2018,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-threatens-to-cut-aid-to-central-american-nations-over-migrant-caravan-1540217440,"TAPACHULA, Mexico—An estimated 5,000 Honduran migrants—some on foot carrying children and some hitching rides on trucks—set out Monday from southern Mexico on a grueling journey toward the U.S. border, as President Trump threatened to end or cut foreign aid to Central American countries for failing to stop the caravan.
The caravan’s 11-day march through Honduras and Guatemala and into Mexico has fueled a fresh political rift between Mr. Trump and those countries’ leaders just two weeks before U.S. midterm elections.
..."
6085,"Trump threatens to summon military to close U.S.-Mexico border, upend trade deal in response to migrant caravan'",Washington Post,10/18/2018,,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-threatens-to-summon-military-to-close-us-mexico-border-in-response-to-migrant-caravan/2018/10/18/d427b1dc-d2bd-11e8-83d6-291fcead2ab1_story.html,"Trump likely lacks the legal authority to carry out all of those drastic measures without congressional approval, but the threats highlighted the potentially perilous political implications for the White House as voters prepare to go to the polls with Republican control of Congress in the balance. In recent campaign rallies, Trump has sought to rally conservatives by asserting falsely that Democrats are in favor of “open borders” and that they favor increased crime.

“All Democrats fault for weak laws!” Trump wrote in one tweet, adding later: “Can you believe this, and what Democrats are allowing to be done to our Country?” The second tweet included a video clip of unknown origin that showed men, speaking Spanish, handing out slips of paper to people in lines carrying bags. The footage was identical to a clip posted by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who claimed it showed cash payments to Hondurans to join the caravan and suggested, without evidence, that the money came from a Democratic megadonor.
Republicans are facing a difficult election on Nov. 6, with polls showing Democrats holding an advantage on the general ballot and prognosticators favoring them to win control of the House. As pressure mounts, nerves have begun to fray inside the White House, with national security adviser John Bolton and Chief of Staff John F. Kelly engaging in a shouting match over immigration just outside the Oval Office on Thursday, according to White House aides.
Bolton had accused Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen of not doing enough to stem the surge in border crossings, and Kelly, who preceded Nielsen in the homeland security job and handpicked her as his successor, came to her defense, aides said. They described the argument as profane and loud enough to draw stares from others in the West Wing.
AD

A White House official said Nielsen came to Bolton’s office after the fight and the two had a positive conversation about her department and the border.
While some GOP leaders in the House had initially hoped to focus their election message on the economy, Trump has continued to highlight immigration, confident that his hard-line views on enforcement will motivate his base and carry significant crossover appeal to independent and moderate voters who helped him win in 2016.
Many Republican candidates, especially in Senate races in states Trump won in 2016, have modeled attack ads on Trump’s rhetoric, aiming to raise public fears over the dangers of illegal immigration. Recent polls show that voters in both parties rank immigration among the top issues that will affect their choices in next month’s elections.

“The border is a big issue for Republican base voters who are already energized after Kavanaugh,” said Chris Wilson, a ­Republican pollster working on battleground races, referring to the contentious Supreme Court confirmation battle over Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. “A reminder that illegal immigration is a real problem and that we just don’t know who is entering our country can only boost Republican interest.”
Democrats dismissed Trump’s accusations as a sign of weakness from a president desperate to escape electoral consequences for failing to make good on his signature campaign promise to reduce illegal immigration.
Border Patrol agents arrested more than 16,000 immigrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border in September, the highest total on record and an increase of 80 percent since July, when Trump reversed his administration’s policy of separating immigrant children from their parents after a public outcry.
AD

In all, more than 107,000 family members were taken into custody in fiscal 2018, obliterating the previous high of just under 78,000 in 2016.
“It’s pretty clear that the things this administration has attempted to address the situation at the border are failing,” said Cecilia Muñoz, an analyst at the think tank New America who served as a White House domestic policy adviser in the Obama administration. “As is typical, this president is trying to lay the blame elsewhere.”
The immigration increase this year, after a sharp drop in the first six months of his presidency, has complicated Trump’s immigration message. In response, he has exhorted aides to enact more extreme policies, including making it more difficult for immigrants to seek asylum protections and measures aimed at increasing criminal prosecutions of unauthorized border-crossers.
AD

The White House is also considering a new policy, known as “binary choice,” which would detain migrant families together and give parents a choice — stay in immigration jail with their child for months or years as their asylum case proceeds, or allow their child to be assigned to a government shelter while a relative or guardian can apply to gain custody.
In his tweets Thursday, Trump aimed to ramp up pressure on foreign governments.
“In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught — and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!” Trump said in one tweet.
AD
In another, he suggested that the “onslaught” of immigrants could undermine a recently announced reworked trade deal with Mexico and Canada, writing that immigration is “far more important to me, as President, than Trade.”
AD
The new deal, which replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement, has yet to be signed by the three countries. Congress is not expected to ratify it before next year.
In recent years, Mexico has detained and deported far more Central Americans attempting to cross Mexico on the way to the United States. Still, Mexico’s southern border with Guatemala remains relatively easy for migrants to cross.
In the wake of Trump’s warnings, the Mexican government signaled that it would take a more restrictive stance on the caravan of migrants this time. Planeloads of federal police have arrived at Mexico’s southern border and are positioned at crossing points. The Mexican Foreign Ministry requested assistance Thursday from the U.N. Refugee Agency in processing Central American refu­gee claims.
AD
The incoming government of Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who takes office in December, campaigned on a softer approach to migrants, saying that protecting their human rights should be a top priority and that they shouldn’t be treated like criminals.
AD
But in response to the latest caravan from Honduras, said to number up to 4,000 people, top officials on López Obrador’s transition team have suggested that they would move to block such large groups of people.
“Mexico can’t say that any caravan can pass to the United States,” Marcelo Ebrard, the incoming foreign minister, said Thursday on Mexican radio.
Mexican government leaders are “trying to perform a very difficult balancing act — on one hand with Trump watching and on the other hand with the Mexican population watching,” said Carlos Bravo Regidor, a professor at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Mexico City.
AD
Immigration is likely to be discussed Friday when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is scheduled to meet with outgoing Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto.
In Washington, no matter how the midterm elections play out, the issue could come to a head in December.
AD
Trump had threatened to force a partial government shutdown in the fall to force Congress to authorize billions of dollars for his proposed border wall. Instead, he signed a stopgap spending measure, setting up a potential fight over the wall in the congressional session between the election and the new Congress.
“Any purely enforcement-oriented solution will only move the needle in the short term,” said Leon Fresco, an immigration attorney who served as an aide to Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “Over the long-term, in order to solve that, he has to either be realistic about a bi­partisan solution and work with Congress — or continue to demagogue it as a political issue, but that’s not going to solve it.”"

President Donald Trump said he’d mobilize the U.S. military to close the border with Mexico to stop an “assault” on the nation by a caravan of migrants from Central America.
Trump, who ran in 2016 promising to tighten U.S. immigration laws and stanch the inflow of undocumented migrants, has called for cutting off foreign aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador if they don’t stop the migrants.

“In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!” Trump said on Twitter.
Hours later, Lieutenant Colonel Jamie Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that “the Department of Defense has not been tasked to provide additional support” beyond National Guard troops already providing assistance.
Trump also attempted to politicize the issue Thursday by claiming -- without providing evidence -- that Democrats are backing the human movement to bolster what he said was the party’s preference for “open borders and existing weak laws.”

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2018
Democrats in Congress generally have supported a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants -- but only those who meet certain criteria -- and have never proposed doing away with border rules. Democrats in 2013 led the charge to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws, an effort that stalled because of opposition from Republicans who controlled the House.
The issue has gained new urgency under Trump, whose “zero-tolerance” policy of enforcing border laws came under fire earlier this year after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a plan that included separating migrant families. Though the administration abandoned that policy, Trump has said he’s considering bringing it back as a deterrent.
Currently more than 2,000 people -- including many who left home so quickly they brought only backpacks -- are making their way from Honduras, traveling through Guatemala and heading toward the U.S., The Associated Press reports.
In April, Trump authorized the National Guard to protect the border as a similar group of migrants headed up from Central America. He later credited authorities in Mexico for breaking up that assembly.
The Defense Department has in the past helped the Department of Homeland Security with border security. And former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both deployed National Guard troops to the border during their administrations to bolster security. But American law may also restrict how much the military can do to carry out Trump’s wishes: The 19th-century Posse Comitatus Act is viewed as prohibiting the use of the military to execute domestic laws, according to a 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service.
In other Twitter posts, Trump claimed -- without substantiation -- that many in the caravan are criminals.

4226,Migrant Children Moved Under Cover of Darkness to a Texas Tent City',New York Times (Online News),10/1/2018,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/us/migrant-children-tent-city-texas.html,"But the mass transfers are raising alarm among immigrant advocates, who were already concerned about the lengthy periods of time migrant children are spending in federal custody.
The roughly 100 shelters that have, until now, been the main location for housing detained migrant children are licensed and monitored by state child welfare authorities, who impose requirements on safety and education as well as staff hiring and training.
The tent city in Tornillo, on the other hand, is unregulated, except for guidelines created by the Department of Health and Human Services. For example, schooling is not required there, as it is in regular migrant children shelters.
Mark Greenberg, who oversaw the care of migrant children under President Barack Obama, helped to craft the emergency shelter guidelines. He said the agency tried “to the greatest extent possible” to ensure that conditions in facilities like the one at Tornillo would mirror those in regular shelters, “but there are some ways in which that’s difficult or impossible to do.”
Several shelter workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being fired, described what they said has become standard practice for moving the children: In order to avoid escape attempts, the moves are carried out late at night because children will be less likely to try to run away. For the same reason, children are generally given little advance warning that they will be moved.
At one shelter in the Midwest whose occupants were among those recently transferred to Tornillo, about two dozen children were given just a few hours’ notice last week before they were loaded onto buses — any longer than that, according to one of the shelter workers, and the children may have panicked or tried to flee.
The children wore belts etched in pen with phone numbers for their emergency contacts. One young boy asked the shelter worker if he would be taken care of in Texas. The shelter worker replied that he would, and told him that by moving, he was making space for other children like him who were stuck at the border and needed a place to live."
4346,Hundreds of migrant children moved to Texas tent camp',Washington Examiner,10/1/2018,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hundreds-of-migrant-children-moved-to-texas-tent-camp,"Hundreds of migrant children detained all across the country are reportedly being sent to a tent camp in Tornillo, Texas, along the U.S.-Mexico border.
The minors were moved late at night to deter them from attempting escapes, according to anonymous shelter workers who spoke with the New York Times. In at least one instance, the children were given only hours of advance notice of the move.
The anonymous same shelter workers said the moves would open up shelters for children still waiting at the border.
The Tornillo camp, located 35 miles southeast of El Paso, opened in June for an initial time period of 30 days with an initial capacity of 400 kids. But its timescale and capacity have since been augmented. The camp can now hold thousands of children and will be open at least through the end of the year.
At the camp, the 20 children are placed in each tent, legal services are scarce, and the only education they are offered is workbooks.
Evelyn Stauffer, a spokeswoman for the Health and Human Services Department, defended the use of this sort of ""temporary"" facility to deal especially with the older kids who are more likely to be released soon via sponsorships.
But the report also mentions that immigrant advocates argue that the children could be stuck there for months.
Tornillo is in Texas' 23rd Congressional District, where Democrat Gina Ortiz Jones is hoping to defeat incumbent Republican Rep. Will Hurd in November. FiveThirtyEight's projections have both candidates in a dead heat with near equal chances to win.
The Homeland Security stopped the ""zero-tolerance"" policy, which contributed problem of finding shelter for young migrants, this summer. It had mandated the separation of children from their families after they were apprehended trying to enter the United States between ports of entry."
4357,Hundreds of young migrants moved to tent city: report',The Hill,10/1/2018,,,https://thehill.com/latino/409140-hundreds-of-young-migrants-moved-to-tent-city-report,"Hundreds of migrant children in recent weeks have been moved from private foster homes or shelters to a tent city in south Texas, according to The New York Times.
The children were reportedly placed on buses in the middle of the night to move from shelters in locations ranging from New York to Kansas to the facility in Tornillo, Texas.

The children are now housed in groups of 20, sleeping in lines of bunk beds and receiving no schooling and minimal access to legal services, the newspaper reported, adding that in private shelters and foster homes, the children slept two or three to a room, received formal schooling and had regular visits with legal representatives.

The newspaper previously reported that the number of migrant children in federal custody has increased from 2,400 in May 2017 to a record 12,800 this month.
The facility in Tornillo reportedly opened in June with a 450-bed capacity and was scheduled to stay open for just 30 days. But it is now expected to stay open until at least the end of the year and now accommodates 3,800 beds.
“It is common to use influx shelters as done on military bases in the past, and the intent is to use these temporary facilities only as long as needed,” Evelyn Stauffer, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), told the Times.
Stauffer added that the mass influx of migrant children is the result of a ""broken immigration system."""

The revelation echoes an admission in April by the Department of Health and Human Services that the government had similarly lost track of an additional 1,475 migrant children it had moved out of shelters last year.
In findings that lawmakers described as troubling, Senate investigators said the department could not determine with certainty the whereabouts of 1,488 out of 11,254 children the agency had placed with sponsors in 2018, based on follow-up calls from April 1 to June 30.
The inability to track the whereabouts of migrant children after they have been released to sponsors has raised concerns that they could end up with human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives."

The development follows an admission in April by federal officials that they did not know the whereabouts of 1,475 immigrant children, according to The New York Times.
As in that instance, the Department of Health and Human Services had moved the children out of federal shelters and placed them with sponsors, but since then officials remain uncertain where the latest 1,488 kids are located.
Immigrant children are led by staff in single file between tents at a detention facility next to the Mexican border in Tornillo, Texas in June 2018
The missing children account for about 13 percent of the 11,254 children that DHS has placed with sponsors so far in 2018.
DHS has a method of calling sponsors who have taken the children 30 days after placement, and those calls have been fruitless in the cases of the lost migrant children.
However, department officials have said they are no longer responsible for the minors once they have been placed outside of DHS custody.
'These children are not 'lost,""' DHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley told The Times. 'Their sponsors — who are usually parents or family members and in all cases have been vetted for criminality and ability to provide for them — simply did not respond or could not be reached when this voluntary call was made.'
The new developments came as Republican and Democrat lawmakers proposed new legislation on Tuesday that would create clear parameters defining DHS's responsibility to the immigrant children, before and after being placed with a sponsor.
The draft bill would require DHS to conduct background checks on sponsors before placing children with them, and mandate that the agency would have to ensure sponsors appropriately care for the children and appear at hearings in immigration court.
The legislation would also mandate that DHS notifies the states where migrant children are placed in advance, and further increase the number of immigration judges to offset a massive backlog of nearly 750,000 cases.

'This bill will ensure that we keep track of unaccompanied minors in our country, which will both help protect them from trafficking and abuse as well as help ensure they appear for their immigration court proceedings,' said Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio and the bill's co-sponsor. 'These efforts are critical for safeguarding these children and upholding our immigration system. This isn't a partisan issue.'
Fellow co-sponsor Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut echoed Portman's sentiments.
'Children who risk their lives to make a dangerous journey in pursuit of asylum shouldn't then have to worry about falling victim to human trafficking or being handed over to abusive or neglectful adults in the United States,' Blumenthal said.
DHS has placed more than 135,000 unaccompanied migrant children with sponsors in the U.S. since October 2014."

The New York Times reported that a congressional investigation released on Tuesday found that the Department of Health and Human Services could not determine the location of 1,488 children who moved from federal shelters and were placed with sponsors.

The nearly 1,500 children that HHS cannot account for is among the 11,254 migrant children the agency had placed with sponsors this year, according to the Times.
The figures are based on follow-up calls to sponsors between April 1 and June 30, the newspaper noted, adding that the lack of knowledge about the whereabouts of about 1,500 children gives rise to fear that they could end up in the hands of human traffickers.
""As communicated to members of Congress multiple times, these children are not ‘lost,'"" Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for HHS, said in a statement to the Times.
""Their sponsors — who are usually parents or family members and in all cases have been vetted for criminality and ability to provide for them — simply did not respond or could not be reached when this voluntary call was made.”
The findings regarding the amount of children HHS can't account for comes after the department said in April that it could not account for 1,475 immigrant children that had been transferred out of federal shelters earlier this year.
The discovery was released as GOP and Democratic senators introduced legislation intended to improve the safety of migrant children, even when they are not under HHS custody.
Among other provisions, the legislation senators introduced would order HHS to run background checks before placing a child with a sponsor.

4365,$10M redirected from FEMA funds to ICE less than a year after Hurricane Maria',Washington Examiner,9/12/2018,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/budgets-deficits/10m-redirected-from-fema-funds-to-ice-less-than-a-year-after-hurricane-maria,"Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., shared documents Tuesday that purported to show millions of dollars being redirected from FEMA’s budget to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to pay for immigration detention.
The Department of Homeland Security’s “Transfer and Reprogramming Notifications” seemed to order the redirection of money from FEMA to ICE less than a year after Hurricane Maria hit the U.S. last year, and right before the 2018 hurricane season, according to MSNBC.
Merkley told MSNBC Tuesday that the documents showing the $9,755,303 transfer are authentic and the transfer happened this summer.
A DHS spokesperson confirmed the transfer, but said none of the money being transferred to ICE came from disaster response and recovery efforts.
“Under no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from FEMA to immigration enforcement efforts,” DHS spokesperson Tyler Houlton posted to Twitter Tuesday. “This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster.”
Houlton continued that the money could not have been used for hurricane response due to limitations.

“It means that just as hurricane season is starting, because it generally starts June 1, the administration is working hard to find funds for additional detention camps, and of course this is all part of the child separation policy,” Merkley said.
The Democratic senator, who has worked against President Trump’s zero tolerance illegal immigration policy, says the nearly $10 million going toward ICE would help to build internment camps for children separated from their families when crossing the border illegally."

Jeff Merkley (D-Ore).
The lawmaker first shared the documents with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, saying that the Department of Homeland Security requested the money “just as hurricane season [was] starting” and as it was attempting to fund Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the midst of its new “zero tolerance” immigration policy. The controversial crackdown resulted in the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents, hundreds of whom have yet to be reunited.
“This is a scandal. At the start of hurricane season — when American citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are still suffering from FEMA’s inadequate recovery efforts — the administration transferred millions of dollars away from FEMA,” Merkley said in a statement to HuffPost. “And for what? To implement their profoundly misguided ‘zero tolerance’ policy. It wasn’t enough to rip thousands of children out of the arms of their parents — the administration chose to partly pay for this horrific program by taking away from the ability to respond to damage from this year’s upcoming and potentially devastating hurricane season.”

The document’s release comes just days before Hurricane Florence, a powerful Category 4 storm, is expected to make landfall in the Carolinas. Millions of people are currently evacuating or hunkering down.
“$10 million comes out of FEMA when we’re facing a hurricane season knowing what’s happened last year,” Merkley told Maddow on Tuesday. “And look what we’ve had since, a hurricane just barely miss Hawaii. ... Now we have this hurricane, Florence, bearing down on the Carolinas.”
DHS spokesman Tyler Houlton late Tuesday called the senator’s appearance a “sorry attempt to push a false agenda,” saying the administration was instead “focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster.”
“The money in question — transferred to ICE from FEMA’s routine operating expenses — could not have been used for hurricane response due to appropriation limitations,” Houlton wrote on Twitter. “DHS/FEMA stand fiscally and operationally ready to support current and future response and recovery needs.”

Houlton (@SpoxDHS) September 12, 2018
The document released by Merkley, which was supplied to HuffPost, states that more than $2.3 million from a total of about $9.8 million had been diverted from FEMA’s “response and recovery” budget. Other funding was transferred from regional operations, mitigation efforts, preparedness and protection, and mission support budgets.
The amount transferred is less than 1 percent of FEMA’s budget for the fiscal year, according to the document, which also notes that the agency’s “mission impact” would be minimized as FEMA would only be required to “curtail training, travel, public engagement sessions, IT security support and infrastructure maintenance, and IT investments.”
The Department of Homeland Security has the authority to move a limited amount of money around within its budget. In the past, Congress had limited DHS from shuffling more than $5 million from one approved program to another through the process known as “reprogramming.”
A coalition of human rights groups penned a letter on June 27 asking the Senate Committee on Appropriations to oppose attempts by DHS to up the amount of funding for immigrant detention, accusing the department of “dramatically overspending its appropriated budget in ways both morally reprehensible and fiscally irresponsible.”
The $10 million of additional funds that DHS aims to use to expand immigrant detention amounts to less than 1 percent of the ICE budget for locking up immigrants, which tops $1.4 billion."

The revelation, just ahead of Hurricane Florence's expected landfall in North and South Carolina, was found by Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., who first shared the documents live on MSNBC late Tuesday.
He told USA TODAY that after the devastation of last year's storms, including hurricanes Maria, Harvey and Irma, FEMA should have the funds it needs to be prepared for another disastrous hurricane season.
""It's almost guaranteed to happen again, so this is just incredibly irresponsible,"" Merkley said.
The budgeting document, titled ""Department of Homeland Security FY 2018 transfer and reprogramming notifications,"" lists $9,755,303 taken from FEMA's budget, about .9 percent of the agency's listed overall budget, and given to support ICE.
Money was also taken from other agencies, including millions from theTransportation Security Administration and the U.S. Coast Guard, to help ICE, the document states.
The document lists the additional money was taken to help ICE detain immigrants along the southern border, fund beds in detention centers and remove undocumented immigrants from the country.
""ICE must have sufficient detention bed capacity to detain illegal aliens when necessary as it enforces the Nation's immigration laws as fairly and effectively as possible,"" the budget document states. ""Ensuring adequate funding for the detention beds requires projecting an Average Daily Population (ADP) for adult detainees as well as the daily costs incurred in keeping a detainee in custody.""
The nearly $10 million was taken from various places within FEMA, including training, preparedness and protection, and response and recovery operations.
Tylet Houlton, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees both agencies, dismissed criticism of the document as a ""sorry attempt to push a false agenda"" and said none of the money transferred came from disaster relief funding.
""Under no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from @fema to immigration enforcement efforts. This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster,"" he said in a tweet. ""The money in question — transferred to ICE from FEMA’s routine operating expenses — could not have been used for hurricane response due to appropriation limitations.""
More: Trump calls Puerto Rico response an 'unsung success'
While it's not uncommon for agencies to move money around, FEMA's budget was decimated last year due to the barrage of storms and fires that affected the nation and the agency was criticized heavily for its handling of the disaster in Puerto Rico.
Merkely said he was made aware of FEMA's budget cuts while looking into a solution for family separation and the detention centers set up along the border. He said the document makes it clear ICE is using money from FEMA ""to build more detention centers.""
Merkely said he believes the budgeting reallocation happened in response to the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy, which was rolled out earlier this year.
The policy led to thousands of families being separated and housed in detention centers, which he says may have increased the need for more money in ICE's budget.

Last month, I joined about 15,000 other cyclists in a weeklong bike ride across Iowa. We rode past cornfields and through small towns, which welcomed us with pork barbecue, slices of pie and all the trappings of a rolling state fair.
Every so often, alongside the lemonade stands or in people’s yards, I spotted posters. They featured the smiling face of a young woman named Mollie Tibbetts. She was missing, the posters said. Please call with information.
Tibbetts, a 20-year-old University of Iowa student, went out for a run on July 18 in her hometown of Brooklyn, Iowa, and never returned. A massive search was on. Her family held out hope she’d been kidnapped and would be found alive.
Iowa law enforcement officials announced the worst on Tuesday morning. A woman’s body, believed to be that of Tibbetts, had been found buried beneath corn stalks in a field near the town where she’d grown up. A 24-year-old man named Cristhian Bahena Rivera led police to the site. He’s been charged with Tibbetts’ murder.
Rivera is a native of Mexico who is believed to have been living in the area for four to seven years. He worked at a dairy farm. And he is in the United States without papers.
And with that last detail, Tibbetts’ death has instantly become a red-hot wedge that President Donald Trump and his supporters are wielding to their political advantage this midterm election cycle (and will surely continue to use long after the race).
The seal-the-border crowd has drawn Tibbetts into its fold and is using her name and her tragic death to benefit its cause.
By Tuesday evening, the killing of the college student, allegedly at the hands of an undocumented immigrant, was the biggest story on FOX News. Never mind the blockbuster courtroom developments that same day that resulted in Trump’s personal lawyer and his former campaign chairman being convicted of multiple felony crimes.
Iowa’s Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, quickly weighed in with a statement of her own. “We are angry that a broken immigration system allowed a predator like this to live in our community,” Reynolds said, as though her state’s economy doesn’t rely on immigrants ― legal or otherwise ― to prop up its agricultural and manufacturing sectors.
Trump himself tossed the bone to a crowd of supporters at a rally in West Virginia on Tuesday night. “You heard about today, with the illegal alien coming in from, very sadly, from Mexico,” he said. “And you saw what happened to that incredible, beautiful young woman.”
A rational response would be, “What’s your point?” As the president and his administration remind us constantly, thousands of undocumented immigrants enter the United States every year. But what this administration repeatedly fails to mention is that multiple studies have shown they are much less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. The number who commit serious violent crimes is smaller yet.
But Trump is not a rational leader, and these are not rational times. The noxious group known as FAIR, or the Federation for American Immigration Reform, keeps a running list of “serious crimes by illegal aliens.” Trump in June attempted to deflect attention from his administration’s policy of separating parents and children at the border by inviting family members of Americans who’d been killed by undocumented immigrants to the White House.
Suddenly, every immigrant who has entered the United States without papers is a potential menace. They are not human beings with joys, sorrows and stories; they are felons in the making.
And now, just as special counsel Robert Mueller’s vise of an investigation tightens, and pundits warn of Democratic gains in November, current events have served up Mollie Tibbetts and Cristhian Bahena Rivera. The beautiful, quintessentially wholesome Iowa girl allegedly murdered by the illegal alien from Mexico. (Who, by the way, worked on a dairy farm owned by the family of a prominent Iowa Republican.)
Suddenly, every immigrant who has entered the United States without papers is a potential menace. They are not human beings with joys, sorrows and stories; they are felons in the making. Round them up. Build the wall. There is nothing Trump would rather talk about.
In her death, Mollie Tibbetts is quickly becoming an unwitting tool of the haters. It doesn’t matter what she thought about undocumented immigrants or immigrants in general. It doesn’t matter that members of her extended family have asked that her killing not be politicized. The seal-the-border crowd has drawn Tibbetts into its fold and is using her name and her tragic death to benefit its cause. They will distill her memory into that of the young woman in Iowa murdered by the undocumented immigrant, when in fact she was so much more than that.
Hours after police found her body, former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Axios that “if Molly Tibbetts is a household name by October, Democrats will be in deep trouble.”
That’s the plan, and it’s reprehensible. Fair-minded Americans must push back against this cynical ploy to use a family’s tragedy to rip a new seam in an already divided nation.

2002,After Mollie Tibbetts tragic death \xe2\x80\x93 we owe it to her to fix our broken immigration system',Fox News (Online),8/23/2018,,,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/08/23/after-mollie-tibbetts-tragic-death-owe-it-to-her-to-fix-our-broken-immigration-system.html,"The tragic killing of 20-year-old University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts – allegedly by an illegal immigrant from Mexico – appears to be yet another example of America’s dangerous and failed immigration policy.
Authorities in Iowa charged a man identified as Cristhian Rivera with first-degree murder Tuesday in Tibbetts’ death. He is being held in jail on a $5 million cash-only bond.
According to authorities, Rivera – if that is really his name – is a 24-year old illegal immigrant from Mexico, whose movements driving a black SUV in the area of Tibbetts’ disappearance were caught on security cameras. Tibbets disappeared July 18 while she was running in the rural central Iowa town of Brooklyn.
How many more needless deaths will it take for our immigration policies to change?
Apologists for illegal immigration are already trying to deflect public attention from this horrific case.
When asked about Tibbetts’ killing on CNN, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. – beloved by far-left Democrats and a possible presidential contender in 2020 – said that she knows this is hard for the Tibbetts family. However, she said that our focus should be “on where the real problems are,” which she said is the separation of “mamas and babies” who entered the U.S. illegally at the border.
Fordham University Professor Christina Greer lamented on MSNBC that “Fox News is talking about a girl in Iowa” instead of devoting more air time to court proceedings Tuesday resulting in felony convictions for former Trump presidential campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a guilty plea to other crimes by President Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen. Greer later backtracked for what she called her “flippant” remark about Tibbetts.
Americans should not be distracted by the chirping of these and other advocates of open borders, including the Cato Institute, which claims misleadingly that illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes than Americans. Even if that statement was factual (it isn’t), it is completely irrelevant to this case, and no comfort to the victims.
The reality is that while most illegal immigrants are not violent, many do commit crimes, sometimes horrific ones, just like Americans do.
The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office estimates in a new report that since 1974 there have been more than 32,000 immigrants incarcerated for homicide in federal and state prisons. Other government reports show that most of these criminal immigrants are in the country illegally. They are not usually legal immigrants, who are vetted for criminal records.
It sounds obvious, but nowadays it is necessary to remind lawmakers that these homicides and many other crimes could have been prevented with better border security to block illegal entry into the U.S.
The fact that illegal immigration exacerbates crime is not lost on America’s local law enforcement agencies. Sheriffs and police leaders have become more and more outspoken in recent years urging the federal government – and especially Congress – to shore up our immigration enforcement.
Hundreds of sheriffs signed a letter to Congress in the spring, asking for the passage of a House bill to improve enforcement. The letter states: “Year after year, we have been warning the Federal government about detrimental increases in transnational drug trafficking, gang violence, sex trafficking, murder, and other escalating incidents of crime by illegal aliens entering our country.”
Not only are criminal immigrants a threat to the community, they are a strain on taxpayers. The same GAO report found that federal and state governments spent about $2.5 billion on incarcerating foreign criminals in 2015 – not including the additional cost of arrest, prosecution, deportation, and of course, the cost to the victims. Now we see how high the cost can be to Iowans for some of the low-wage workers demanded by local farmers.
The killing of Mollie Tibbetts also highlights the role of identity fraud in facilitating the illegal employment that draws most illegal immigrants to this country.
Rivera reportedly used a false identity to secure an Iowa photo ID card and may have used these documents to secure employment at a farm, where he apparently worked for four years. It has not been revealed if he used these same documents to get a driver’s license.
Authorities said the Chevy Malibu that Rivera used to stalk Tibbetts and then transport her body to the corn field where she was later found was not registered in his name. That’s a common practice for unlicensed drivers, and another in the list of crimes of “otherwise law-abiding” illegal immigrants.
An estimated 75 percent of illegal immigrants obtain false documents. Counterfeit green cards are not difficult to detect, but incidents of total identity theft – in which the illegal immigrant uses the name, date of birth, and Social Security number of a real person – have become more common.
The Trump administration is cracking down on this practice. Last month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions traveled to Boston to announce the results of Operation Double Trouble. Under the enforcement operation, dozens of illegal immigrants were charged with identity theft-related crimes, including fraudulently obtaining Medicaid and other welfare benefits, and registering to vote.
Some of those charged are heroin traffickers, who have obtained U.S. passports to facilitate their deadly illicit commerce.
More can be done, even without passing new laws.
The Social Security Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, and immigration agencies must be empowered to work together to act on instances of the multiple use of Social Security numbers that are easily detectable within government tax and crime databases.
Citizens should be notified when their Social Security numbers have been compromised. Employers should have to terminate illegal workers when detected. Agencies should use facial recognition technology more frequently to detect imposters.
As long as prospective illegal immigrants believe that after making it past border and visa controls they will be able to get a job, a driver’s license, and live as if they were in the U.S. legally, they will continue to come.
Like the smuggling rings, the identity document industry is part of the infrastructure of illegal immigration. And like the smugglers, the document vendors do not care whether their clients are harmless workers, drug traffickers, terrorists or criminals.
When authorities allow such illicit enterprises to flourish, they are inviting more illegal immigration, and setting the stage for more atrocities committed by people who should not have found it so easy to get here and stay here illegally."
5383,"Iowa student's murder thrust into U.S. debate over immigration""",Reuters,8/23/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iowa-crime/iowa-students-murder-thrust-into-us-debate-over-immigration-idUSKCN1L72BU,"(Reuters) - The arrest of a man who U.S. authorities have said is an illegal immigrant on charges of murdering an Iowa college student has thrust the case into the debate on immigration policy, with President Donald Trump blaming Mollie Tibbetts’ death on weak laws.
Christhian Rivera, 24, was arrested and charged on Monday with the murder of 20-year-old Tibbetts, who disappeared in July while out jogging. A woman’s body has been found but has not yet been positively identified, authorities have said.
Law enforcement officials told reporters on Monday that Rivera was Mexican and in the country illegally. However, his defense lawyer said in a court filing on Wednesday that Rivera had legal status.
Trump, who has taken a tough stance on immigration and referred to some Mexican migrants as criminals and rapists in his 2016 election campaign, made a reference to the Tibbetts case at a rally in West Virginia on Tuesday.
“Should never have happened,” said Trump. “The immigration laws are such a disgrace.”
The political fallout from the killing could reverberate across Iowa, a swing state that has a hotly contested gubernatorial race and where Democrats see a chance at taking two of the 23 seats they need to win back from Republicans in November’s midterms to gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
Iowa Republican Governor Kim Reynolds echoed Trump’s approach, blaming Tibbetts’ death on the nation’s immigration laws.
“We are angry that a broken immigration system allowed a predator like this to live in our community, and we will do all we can bring justice to Mollie’s killer,” she said in a Tuesday statement.

But Republican members of Congress and congressional candidates in closely competitive Iowa districts were more guarded, perhaps wary of voter backlash if they politicized the case.
Republican lawmakers Rod Blum and David Young each issued statements expressing sympathy for the Tibbetts’ family but avoided any mention of illegal immigration.
Christopher Peters, a Republican mounting a long-shot challenge to Iowa Democratic Congressman Dave Loebsack, said on Facebook that politicizing Tibbetts’ murder “cheapens the death of this young woman.”
“Yes, our immigration system is broken, and Congress has failed to fix it,” Peters wrote. “There is much we can and must do. For now, though, we should mourn the loss of Mollie.”
Tibbetts’ father, who made many public pleas for information about his daughter’s whereabouts, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. A man who picked up the phone at the home of Tibbetts’ mother in Iowa declined to comment.
During his 2016 campaign, Trump spoke almost daily about the 2015 death of Kate Steinle, who was struck by a bullet that ricocheted off the ground after being accidentally fired by an illegal immigrant. A jury last year cleared the immigrant of murder and manslaughter charges, and Trump railed against the decision.
Iowa voters might recoil at Tibbetts’ death being politicized so quickly, said Timothy Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa.
“Kate Steinle was used nationally by Republicans as an example of a system that needs fixing,” Hagle said. “That might happen again, but I’m not sure it will be handled the same way in Iowa.”

“I wish Trump had not made this political,” said Janice, a 60-year-old waitress at the Classic Deli, who declined to give her last name. “The family just wants to heal. I have a farm with Mexican immigrants, and I never felt afraid.”"

In a letter issued Monday, Trump asked public officials to applaud the “sacrifice” of ICE officers as well as Customs and Border Protection agents.
“Through letters, public statements, op-eds, resolutions, and events, we can give our voice to our Nation’s longstanding tradition of honoring the public servants who protect our communities and our way of life,” Trump wrote.
He said he wrote the letter because ICE has become a political punching bag, with a number of likely Democratic 2020 hopefuls — including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) — urging that the agency be abolished.
“Tragically, the brave men and women of ICE have recently been subjected to a nationwide campaign of smears, insults, and attacks by politicians shamelessly catering to the extreme elements of our society that desire lawlessness and anarchy,” Trump said in the letter.
“These horrendous assaults are no-doubt spurred on by the dangerous ‘Abolish ICE’ movement – a movement to abolish our borders entirely,” the president said.
Trump referenced protests against ICE in Portland, Oregon — in which the protesters had the backing of the city’s mayor — and in Louisville, Kentucky.
“Yet, while anarchist protesters hurl vicious insults at ICE officers in Portland and other disturbing episodes nationwide, those same ICE officers continue to dutifully remove some of the most dangerous and violent individuals from the communities they protect – putting their lives on the line in the process,” Trump said.
The president said that in fiscal year 2017, ICE arrested more than 125,000 “aliens” with criminal records. He also pointed out how immigration enforcement plays a part in keeping the US safe post-9/11.
“We also must not forget the important role that ICE and CBP play in preventing terrorism,” the president said. “The attacks were carried out by foreign nationals who exploited our lax immigration laws and defrauded our immigration system in order to murder nearly 3,000 innocent people.”
Trump was hosting an event later in the day, a “Salute to the Heroes of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection,” at the White House.
He’s invited ICE officers, CBP agents and politicians, including Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) and Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, to take part."
2367,"President Trump attacks critics of border agents, warns of 'bloodshed and suffering'""",USA TODAY,8/20/2018,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/20/trump-backs-ice-open-letter-calls-local-cooperation/1042715002/,"WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump called on local officials to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in an open letter Monday, warning that “terror, bloodshed and suffering” would continue without their cooperation.
Trump’s letter, which was released by the White House hours before he was scheduled to hold an event to “salute” immigration officials, criticized the “abolish ICE” movement supported by some Democrats on Capitol Hill.
“Tragically, the brave men and woman of ICE have recently been subjected to a nationwide campaign of smears, insults and attacks by politicians shamelessly catering to the extreme elements in our society that desire lawlessness and anarchy,” Trump wrote to state and local leaders.
Though Trump did not mention Democrats directly in the letter, the language mirrors rhetoric the president has often embraced during campaign rallies. He regularly accuses Democratic candidates at those events of supporting “open borders.”
Returning to an issue that was central to his 2016 campaign, Trump has been working to bring immigration to the fore again in this year’s midterms, hitting Democrats who have supported abolishing the agency.
ICE came under new scrutiny this year following the president's ""zero tolerance"" policy, which led to high profile family separations at the border.
A group of House Democrats introduced legislation last month to abolish ICE within one year, although the legislation has little to no chance of becoming law because neither the Republican majority nor many centrist Democrats support the idea.
In the letter, Trump mentioned the protests that took place this summer in Louisville, Kentucky, and Portland, Oregon.
And the president called on local officials to voluntarily comply with federal immigration agencies, even as some cities and counties have decided to restrict the level of information they will provide to ICE.
“The most recent assaults include the repugnant hostility directed toward selfless ICE employees in Portland, Oregon, and the verbal abuse suffered by ICE employees in Louisville, Kentucky,” Trump wrote.

6780,"Trump sees political win in some Democrats' calls to abolish ICE""",Los Angeles Times,8/20/2018,,,http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-ice-20180820-story.html,"President Trump brandished two of his favorite political weapons at the White House on Monday: a phalanx of uniformed law enforcement officers by his side, and an angry denunciation of Democrats as a party of lawlessness and open borders.
Unabashedly politicizing the federal agency established in 2003, the president aligned himself with rank-and-file Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers he invited to the White House and repeatedly lionized as “brave heroes,” while battering Democrats as “extremists” who want to “abolish America’s borders.”
“They have no courage,” Trump said. “They have no guts. They just have big, loud mouths.”
Trump took special aim at Democrats who have called for abolishing ICE, as some on the party’s left wing have done. The president called it a “grave betrayal of these law enforcement officers and the noble sacrifices they make to uphold our laws, secure our borders and protect our safety.”

Determined to head off a Democratic takeover of the House, Trump gave no quarter in the polarizing battle over immigration, even emphasizing the controversial enforcement crackdown that resulted in more than 2,600 migrant children being taken from their families on the Southwest border this spring and placed in shelters.
That harsh policy led to a national outcry and signs of a political debacle for the White House, forcing Trump to back down in June. U.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw, who had ordered the administration to reunite the families, criticized the government last month for its lack of preparation and coordination. More than 400 parents were deported without their children.
Trump sought to regain the political upper hand Monday with an event in the East Room saluting several dozen officers from ICE, which arrests and deports people in the country illegally, and agents from Customs and Border Protection, which is responsible for guarding the border (although he repeatedly referred to “CBC,” not “CBP,” in his comments).
The president credited them with “liberating towns” from MS-13 gangs but reserved his harshest rhetoric for Democrats, who he accused of “shameful attacks on our great law enforcement.”

“Any politician who puts criminal aliens before American citizens should find a new line of work,” Trump said, drawing applause.
Democrats have used Trump’s immigration crackdown — and the symbolism surrounding an agency that has come under fire for workplace raids and widespread reports of sexual and physical abuse in ICE detention facilities — to build enthusiasm among core supporters and activists.
But establishment Democrats worry that calls to abolish ICE, which has more than 20,000 employees, could backfire in November.
Those concerns grew after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez beat a party leader in a Democratic primary House race in New York, making her an instant celebrity. Since she had campaigned on abolishing ICE, the party’s liberal base has pushed others to embrace it.

Two leading potential presidential contenders — Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York — have joined the cause, a sign that the party is being tugged to the left as it considers how to confront Trump in 2020.
While the movement has some supporters in Congress, many Democrats have stayed away, choosing to focus on ICE’s documented abuses and Trump’s rhetoric and policies rather than taking on a challenge that has low support in polls.
Some who support abolishing ICE concede it may not happen but hope to push the center of the immigration debate further to the left, much as conservatives have pulled their party to the right by staking out extreme positions.
Advocates of eliminating ICE said they do not seek to end enforcement of immigration laws. But they say that ICE has twisted its mission by focusing on deportation of families at the expense of preventing crime and terrorism.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California has tried to split the issue, calling for “fundamentally reforming ICE’s mission,” while stopping short of endorsing an end to the agency.
Customs and Border Protection, not ICE, is tasked with patrolling the border, but many people conflate their roles.
“When you say ‘abolish ICE,’ what the rest of the population gets is that you want to leave the borders unguarded,” said Jose Dante Parra, a Miami-based political consultant who served as the point person for Latino outreach for former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid.
Parra, who works with immigration advocacy groups, supports the goal of overhauling ICE, arguing that it focuses on “mothers dropping off their kids at school who then go to clean somebody’s house,” rather than harder targets like terrorism rings and drug traffickers.

Mary Small, policy director for Detention Watch Network, an immigration advocacy group in Washington, called Trump’s focus on ICE “propaganda that’s really intended to stoke people’s fears” because of the public outcry to his immigration crackdown.
“People are having a visceral reaction to seeing this administration’s enforcement of these policies,” Small said. “The perception of ICE agents has already shifted. So the president holding up these ICE agents as heroes — it’s a response to the fact that our stories are breaking through.”
Trump and many Republicans are eager to talk about abolishing ICE. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin recently said it showed that Democrats had “really jumped the shark on the left.”
More than half of voters — 54% — surveyed in a July poll by Politico/Morning Consult opposed eliminating ICE, while only 25% want to abolish the agency.

“From a political standpoint this is a gift from the Democrats,” said Matt Schlapp, a Trump ally and chairman of the American Conservative Union. “It shows their heart, which is one of radicalism.”
Schlapp, whose wife, Mercedes, works in the White House communications office and moderated a panel at Monday’s event, links Trump’s embrace of ICE and Border Patrol agents to his other law-and-order rhetoric, including his criticism of National Football League players who have protested police brutality during the national anthem and Trump’s embrace of the Blue Lives Matter movement.
During her panel ahead of the president’s remarks, Mercedes Schlapp asked several law enforcement agents and lawmakers to react specifically to calls to “abolish” ICE.
They responded with predictable umbrage, with Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) calling such a proposal “unconscionable” and “unpatriotic.”

6830,Stephen Miller Is an Immigration Hypocrite. I Know Because I\xe2\x80\x99m His Uncle.',Politico,8/13/2018,,,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/08/13/stephen-miller-is-an-immigration-hypocrite-i-know-because-im-his-uncle-219351,"Dr. David S. Glosser is a retired neuropsychologist: formerly a member of the Neurology faculties of Boston University School of Medicine and Jefferson Medical College.
Let me tell you a story about Stephen Miller and chain migration.
It begins at the turn of the 20th century, in a dirt-floor shack in the village of Antopol, a shtetl of subsistence farmers in what is now Belarus. Beset by violent anti-Jewish pogroms and forced childhood conscription in the Czar’s army, the patriarch of the shack, Wolf-Leib Glosser, fled a village where his forebears had lived for centuries and took his chances in America.

He set foot on Ellis Island on January 7, 1903, with $8 to his name. Though fluent in Polish, Russian and Yiddish, he understood no English. An elder son, Nathan, soon followed. By street corner peddling and sweatshop toil, Wolf-Leib and Nathan sent enough money home to pay off debts and buy the immediate family’s passage to America in 1906. That group included young Sam Glosser, who with his family settled in the western Pennsylvania city of Johnstown, a booming coal and steel town that was a magnet for other hardworking immigrants. The Glosser family quickly progressed from selling goods from a horse and wagon to owning a haberdashery in Johnstown run by Nathan and Wolf-Leib to a chain of supermarkets and discount department stores run by my grandfather, Sam, and the next generation of Glossers, including my dad, Izzy. It was big enough to be listed on the AMEX stock exchange and employed thousands of people over time. In the span of some 80 years and five decades, this family emerged from poverty in a hostile country to become a prosperous, educated clan of merchants, scholars, professionals, and, most important, American citizens.
What does this classically American tale have to do with Stephen Miller? Well, Izzy Glosser is his maternal grandfather, and Stephen’s mother, Miriam, is my sister.
I have watched with dismay and increasing horror as my nephew, an educated man who is well aware of his heritage, has become the architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our family’s life in this country.
I shudder at the thought of what would have become of the Glossers had the same policies Stephen so coolly espouses— the travel ban, the radical decrease in refugees, the separation of children from their parents, and even talk of limiting citizenship for legal immigrants — been in effect when Wolf-Leib made his desperate bid for freedom. The Glossers came to the U.S. just a few years before the fear and prejudice of the “America first” nativists of the day closed U.S. borders to Jewish refugees. Had Wolf-Leib waited, his family likely would have been murdered by the Nazis along with all but seven of the 2,000 Jews who remained in Antopol. I would encourage Stephen to ask himself if the chanting, torch-bearing Nazis of Charlottesville, whose support his boss seems to court so cavalierly, do not envision a similar fate for him.

Like other immigrants, our family’s welcome to the USA was not always a warm one, but we largely had the protection of the law, there was no state-sponsored violence against us, no kidnapping of our male children, and we enjoyed good relations with our neighbors. True, Jews were excluded from many occupations, couldn’t buy homes in some towns, couldn’t join certain organizations or attend certain schools or universities, but life was good. As in past generations, there were hate mongers who regarded the most recent groups of poor immigrants as scum, rapists, gangsters, drunks and terrorists, but largely the Glosser family was left alone to live our lives and build the American dream. Children were born, synagogues founded, and we thrived. This was the miracle of America.
Acting for so long in the theater of right-wing politics, Stephen and Trump may have become numb to the resultant human tragedy and blind to the hypocrisy of their policy decisions. After all, Stephen’s is not the only family with a chain immigration story in the Trump administration. Trump's grandfather is reported to have been a German migrant on the run from military conscription to a new life in the United States, and his mother fled the poverty of rural Scotland for the economic possibilities of New York City. (Trump’s in-laws just became citizens on the strength of his wife’s own citizenship.)
These facts are important not only for their grim historical irony but because vulnerable people are being hurt. They are real people, not the ghoulish caricatures portrayed by Trump. When confronted by the deaths and suffering of thousands, our senses are overwhelmed, and the victims become statistics rather than people. I meet these statistics one at a time through my volunteer service as a neuropsychologist for the Philadelphia affiliate of HIAS (formerly the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society), the global nonprofit that protects refugees and helped my family more than 100 years ago. I will share the story of one such man I have met in the hopes that my nephew might recognize elements of our shared heritage.
In the early 2000s, Joseph (not his real name) was conscripted at the age of 14 to be a soldier in Eritrea and sent to a remote desert military camp. Officers there discovered a Bible under his pillow which aroused their suspicion that he might belong to a foreign evangelical sect that would claim his loyalty and sap his will to fight. Joseph was actually a member of the state-approved Coptic church but was nonetheless immediately subjected to torture. “They smashed my face into the ground, tied my hands and feet together behind my back, stomped on me, and hung me from a tree by my bonds while they beat me with batons for the others to see.”
Joseph was tortured for 20 consecutive days before being taken to a military prison and crammed into a dark unventilated cell with 36 other men, little food and no proper hygiene. Some died, and in time Joseph was stricken with dysentery. When he was too weak to stand, he was taken to a civilian clinic where he was fed by the medical staff. Upon regaining his strength, he escaped to a nearby road where a sympathetic driver took him north through the night to a camp in Sudan where he joined other refugees. Joseph was on the first leg of a journey that would cover thousands of miles and almost 10 years.
Before Donald Trump had started his political ascent promulgating the false story that Barack Obama was a foreign-born Muslim, while my nephew, Stephen, was famously recovering from the hardships of his high school cafeteria in Santa Monica, Joseph was a child on his own in Sudan in fear of being deported back to Eritrea to face execution for desertion. He worked any job he could get, saved his money and made his way through Sudan. He endured arrest and extortion in Libya. He returned to Sudan, then kept moving to Dubai, Brazil and eventually to a southern border crossing into Texas, where he sought asylum. In all of the countries he traveled through during his ordeal, he was vulnerable, exploited and his status was “illegal.” But in the United States, he had a chance to acquire the protection of a documented immigrant.
Today, at 30, Joseph lives in Pennsylvania and has a wife and child. He is a smart, warm, humble man of great character who is grateful for every day of his freedom and safety. He bears emotional scars from not seeing his parents or siblings since he was 14. He still trembles, cries and struggles for breath when describing his torture, and he bears physical scars as well. He hopes to become a citizen, return to work and make his contribution to America. His story, though unique in its particulars, is by no means unusual. I have met Central Americans fleeing corrupt governments, violence and criminal extortion; a Yemeni woman unable to return to her war-ravaged home country and fearing sexual mutilation if she goes back to her Saudi husband; and an escaped kidnap-bride from central Asia.
Trump wants to make us believe that these desperate migrants are an existential threat to the United States; the most powerful nation in world history and a nation made strong by immigrants. Trump and my nephew both know their immigrant and refugee roots. Yet, they repeat the insults and false accusations of earlier generations against these refugees to make them seem less than human. Trump publicly parades the grieving families of people hurt or killed by migrants, just as the early Nazis dredged up Jewish criminals to frighten and enrage their political base to justify persecution of all Jews. Almost every American family has an immigration story of its own based on flight from war, poverty, famine, persecution, fear or hopelessness. Most of these immigrants became workers, entrepreneurs, scientists and soldiers of America.
Most damning is the administration's evident intent to make policy that specifically disadvantages people based on their ethnicity, country of origin and religion. No matter what opinion is held about immigration, any government that specifically enacts law or policy on that basis must be recognized as a threat to all of us. Laws bereft of justice are the gateway to tyranny. Today others may be the target, but tomorrow it might just as easily be you or me. History will be the judge, but in the meantime the normalization of these policies is rapidly eroding the collective conscience of America. Immigration reform is a complex issue that will require compassion and wisdom to bring the nation to a just solution, but the politicians who have based their political and professional identity on ethnic demonization and exclusion cannot be trusted to do so. As free Americans, and descendants of immigrants and refugees, we have the obligation to exercise our conscience by voting for candidates who will stand up for our highest national values and not succumb to our lowest fears."

“If my nephew’s ideas on immigration had been in force a century ago, our family would have been wiped out,” David S. Glosser wrote of his nephew’s attitudes toward immigration in an editorial published by Politico on Monday.
Glosser proceeded to tell a story of a man, Wolf-Leib Glosser, who fled the village of Antopol, now known as Belarus, to come to America.

Glosser said the man arrived in Ellis Island on January 7, 1903, with just $8 to his name and described how he progressed from peddling on the corner and working in sweat shops to owning a haberdashery in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.
“The Glosser family quickly progressed from selling goods from a horse and wagon to owning a haberdashery in Johnstown run by Nathan and Wolf-Leib to a chain of supermarkets and discount department stores run by my grandfather, Sam, and the next generation of Glossers, including my dad, Izzy,” Glosser wrote. “It was big enough to be listed on the AMEX stock exchange and employed thousands of people over time.

Miller has been under scrutiny in recent months as the Trump administration continues to face backlash over its “zero tolerance” policy, which led to the separations of hundreds of migrant families caught crossing the border illegally.

(Leah Millis/Reuters)
In an essay for Politico, David S. Glosser launches into a sharp-tongued critique of the immigration views of Stephen Miller, who is both his nephew and a top Trump aide. With a headline calling Miller a “hypocrite” on immigration, Glosser’s essay tells the rags-to-riches story of Miller’s own ancestors, who arrived in the U.S. as poor Jewish immigrants but ended up owning a number of supermarkets and department stores. This inspiring family history is meant to disqualify Miller’s skepticism of chain migration and current refugee programs.

We see this accusation of “hypocrisy” on immigration a lot. It’s been trotted out against Miller, President Trump, and others. So perhaps it’s worth spending a few minutes looking at the limits of the “hypocrisy” charge.
First of all, the current immigration system would also have excluded the ancestors of many Americans. Family preferences constitute the bulk of new immigrants to the United States; these preferences would have excluded past immigrants who had no family connections in the United States when they first immigrated. This is one of the major reasons why accusations of “hypocrisy” on immigration are not a particularly compelling argument against shifting to a skills-based immigration system. Skills-based migration would exclude many would-be immigrants, but so does our current immigration system.
The “hypocrisy” argument falls short on other grounds, too. Saying that you can’t support changing a policy that benefited your ancestors (or even you) would create a bizarre paralysis in political debates. The robber barons of the Gilded Age benefited from a relative lack of inheritance, income, and capital-gains taxes. Does that mean that Vanderbilt and Rockefeller scions can’t support any of those taxes? What about the people who work at the schools, libraries, and other organizations that industrial magnates donated to — are they allowed to support a taxation system that would have shredded the mega-fortunes upon which their institutions relied? Similar arguments could be applied to other policies. The ancestors of some Americans enjoyed higher wages due to the protective tariff, so can they support cutting tariffs? Should someone who benefited from coal technology block the development of other energy sources?

This paralysis points to one of the deepest methodological problems with closing off policy debate through claims of prior benefit. Part of serious politics is about the common good, the achievement of which can sometimes entail personal sacrifices. A soldier goes off to war knowing he might die, but he takes that great personal risk because he thinks that the common good outweighs that danger. Even if a change in regulations or taxation might hurt a voter, that voter might still support those changes because she believes they are best for the nation as a whole. If politics is to be more than self-dealing, policymaking needs to take into account what is in the national interest. (It’s worth noting that claims on behalf of the common good and the national interest do not necessarily oppose claims on behalf of individual liberty; one might believe that defending certain liberties is part of the common good.)
Now, one might argue that Miller’s preferred policy changes are not in the national interest. But the “hypocrisy” charge detracts from this argument."
4407,"Immigrant recruits booted by the Army left facing deportation, death'",New York Post,8/10/2018,,,https://nypost.com/2018/08/09/immigrant-recruits-booted-by-the-army-left-facing-deportation-death/,"Xiongzhou Zhang’s dream of becoming an American by joining the Army started to fade away with a pounding at the door of his upstate home last month.
A Chinese immigrant and master’s student, Zhang had signed up to join the Army in 2016 with the promise of expedited citizenship for his service, which included Mandarin language skills the Pentagon needed.
But instead of a uniform, Zhang found himself wearing an ankle bracelet after about 10 immigration agents raided the Rochester home he shares with his wife and 20-month-old son on the morning of July 16, threatening the couple with deportation because his legal status had expired.
“We relied on my contract to pursue our dreams,” said Zhang, 29.
“The contract didn’t bring us the citizenship, the job, the salaries and the respect. It just put us under arrest.”
He is one of dozens of recruits whom the Army has discharged in recent months with little explanation since the Trump administration last year disbanded the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest , or MAVNI, program that was designed to recruit highly skilled legal immigrants like Zhang into the armed forces.
Stringent new background checks meant many of the recruits couldn’t get cleared for basic training — for reasons many still don’t know.
A July 20 Army memo made public Thursday by The Associated Press revealed officials have been ordered to stop processing such discharges.
But it’s unclear what that means for those who haven’t been cleared or would-be soldiers like Zhang who have already been given their marching orders.
For now, they’re stuck in a dangerous limbo — because returning to their native countries after joining the US military could be a death sentence.
That was the dilemma facing Brooklynite Yousuf Istajab: risk his student-visa status expiring while he was awaiting clearance for basic training, or return to his native Pakistan and face persecution for joining the US Army Reserves.
“I can’t take the risk of my life and go back while serving in the Army,” said Istajab, 33.
He chose to file for asylum in the US as a last resort, marking a growing trend of US military members fearing deportation to countries where they could be treated as traitors.
Immigration lawyers say they are being swamped by immigrants in the armed services desperate for help to stay in their adopted country.
“It’s crazy,” said Margaret Stock, a retired Army Reserve lieutenant colonel who helped create the MAVNI program and has filed a dozen asylum cases so far.
“They are in the US military, and now they have to claim asylum in America. They should have legal status, and they should have citizenship.”
Maurice Goldman, an immigration attorney in Tucson, Ariz., filed two asylum cases recently for immigrants who signed contracts with the military but now are at risk for deportation to countries where they will be persecuted.
“These are people who were given a raw deal,” Goldman said.
“They agreed to assist the US military and put their own life at potential risk and defend our freedoms in return for the possibility of US citizenship . . . I believe that the US government breached their contract by not standing up to its end of the bargain.”
Neither the Pentagon nor the US Citizenship and Immigration Services could provide information on how many military members have resorted to seeking asylum.
After pledging an oath to the United States, Zhang, too, fears going back to his native country could mean persecution for his family.
He initially came to America legally to pursue a higher education and better opportunities. His girlfriend later followed, and they were married in New York, where their son was born.
Zhang joined the immigrant-recruitment program to earn citizenship and had planned to serve in the Army for 20 years.
For more than two years, he attended weekly meetings for future Army soldiers to meet with his recruiter and to train, while his ship date to basic training got delayed due to the new background check process.
But with the US suddenly canceling his Army contract and his deferred-action status expiring, Zhang and his wife face deportation.
“We chose the MAVNI program because it can guarantee us citizenship within six months after I sign a contract,” Zhang said.
“Two years later, they just threw me away and put me through a deportation process.”
The MAVNI program was developed in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to diversify the armed forces and bring in much-needed language skills.
About 10,000 immigrants joined as a shortcut to US citizenship, but over the years, the program fell under increased scrutiny and oversight, and finally last year, the Pentagon suspended the program entirely.
The Department of Defense also changed the rules to require recruits who were still in the pipeline to undergo special new background checks before shipping out and warned that these checks could take more than a year to complete.
Recruits must sit without access to a phone or computer for a daylong interview during which investigators grill them about every aspect of their life.
They must document their foreign travel since birth, their financial information and spending habits, a list of all associates “living or dead” who have been connected with any government and detailed information on “all foreign-born associates and relatives” they have ever had contact with, according to the manual for the counterintelligence screenings reviewed by The Post.
“The type of background check they are trying to get the noncitizen soldier to pass is as if he was going to be Jared Kushner working in the White House,” said Zhang’s attorney, Beverly Cutler.
“They are giving them our nation’s highest level of national security testing and to not pass that has nothing to do with whether you are qualified to be a citizen.”
The Pentagon didn’t have information on how many recruits passed the new standards, but it contends that the average ratio of passage is two out of three and that the tougher standards were needed for national security.
“The problem with the MAVNI program [is] we found that it was really vulnerable to insider threats and espionage and terrorism and other criminal activity. When that became apparent, we had to do something,” said Pentagon spokeswoman Maj. Carla Gleason.
She said the Pentagon doesn’t tip off immigration officials to newly discharged immigrant recruits to start deportation proceedings.
“No one is being discharged from the military due to their immigration status. They are being discharged due to security suitability,” she said.
New rules also drastically limited citizenship opportunities for all noncitizen recruits.
Previously, one day of military service was sufficient to apply for citizenship. But under the new rules, 180 days of consecutive active duty service or one year in the reserves is required.
The changes shocked Istajab.
“They welcome you. They say you are in our department and you are a US solider. We took an oath of office,” said Istajab, who is working as a dental assistant.
“We were about to ship [to basic training]. And then all of a sudden, the new government came and said, ‘Hey, we don’t know who you guys are . . . You are strangers in our department.’ It’s kind of rough.”
One Chinese MAVNI recruit from New York learned that he didn’t pass an expanded background check — although not why — but hasn’t been officially discharged and is continuing to drill on weekends in his uniform in the hope the Army realizes he poses no threat.
“I don’t have a ship date. I’m just waiting. I’m hoping they change their mind or they made a mistake,” said the recruit, who has been drilling for more than two years.
In China, his decision to serve in the US Army would be viewed as “treason.”
Evidence compiled by Stock in a separate military asylum case shows a string of threats posted on the Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo against Chinese MAVNI soldiers.
“They betrayed their own country,” one threat said. “Kill them!”"
4622,Army Suspends Its Purge of Immigrant Recruits',New York Times (Online News),8/10/2018,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/us/mavni-program-army-discharge-immigrants.html,"The soldiers were recruited mainly for their language skills or medical training. Many speak strategically important languages like Chinese, Korean or Russian. Many have college degrees, and some are medical doctors. More than 10,000 troops have joined the military through the program since it began in 2008, almost all of them serving in the Army.
In recent years, though, the Defense Department has tightened its vetting of immigrant recruits. Now, soldiers joining up to be clerks, mechanics and surgeons face the kinds of extensive background checks that were formerly conducted for troops who needed top secret clearance. The added layers of scrutiny include screenings by the C.I.A. and F.B.I., a review of at least a decade’s worth of personal finances, an exhaustive questionnaire and numerous lengthy interviews.
The new requirements made processing each recruit take much longer, and the backlog of reviews piled up into the thousands. Many recruits have been waiting for years to get the clearances they need to advance in their military careers, and in some cases, Ms. Cutler said, the process has dragged on so long that screenings done at the beginning have since expired and must be done over again. Then the Army started pushing the recruits out.
“They were being discharged even if there was not a security concern,” she said. “These are often highly skilled individuals, many have master’s degrees.”
In a court filing in July, government lawyers called the Mavni program an “elevated security risk,” and said that some recruits had provided false information to obtain student visas and that others had friends who were associated with foreign intelligence organizations.
However, a 2017 report by the RAND Corporation found no evidence that the Mavni program had caused any security problems. The report, which has not been officially released, found that the program’s recruits were generally better educated and performed better than the average enlisted soldier, and had not been involved in terrorism or espionage.
The military may want to curtail the Mavni program simply because it has become an administrative headache, clogged with too many regulations, said Margaret D. Stock, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve who helped create the program and is now an immigration lawyer representing some Mavni soldiers."

The U.S. Army has halted the process of discharging immigrants who enlisted under a program designed to recruit people with critically needed skills.
Reports emerged in July that the Pentagon had canceled the enlistment contracts of dozens of these recruits.
""Effective immediately, you will suspend processing of all involuntary separation actions,"" says the memo from Marshall Williams, the acting assistant secretary of the Army for manpower and reserve affairs.
The program is known as Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest.
""This in no way reflects a change in the Army's compliance with DOD's MAVNI program,"" said Lt. Col. Nina Hill, an Army spokesperson. ""We continue to abide by all requirements to include completing a thorough background investigation on all MAVNI applicants.""
As NPR's Vanessa Romo has reported:
""[MAVNI] was established in 2009 to create an opportunity for the military to enlist people with specialized knowledge, including highly sought-after language and medical skills. ""Those enrolling had to reside in the U.S. legally, such as under student visas, or seek asylum but could not be green card holders. Enlisting gave them a fast-track path to citizenship, sometimes even before beginning basic training.""
The MAVNI program has been officially suspended since 2016, after the Pentagon said its security protocols should be reviewed. But that has left hundreds of people in limbo — and at risk of seeing their visas run out in addition to having their military contracts canceled.
As of April 2018, ""roughly 1,100 people who had signed contracts but had not gone off to basic training"" were still in the pipeline, Maj. Carla Gleason, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon, told NPR last month.
In July, dozens of enlistees were told they weren't eligible to serve in the U.S. military, with officials citing the results of security screenings. But in the case of two recruits who spoke to NPR, those problems seemed to be the existence of any ties outside the U.S.
A reservist who spoke to NPR — and who filed a Freedom of Information Act to discover the reason for his discharge — learned that foreign ties were to blame. His fiancée and his parents live in Pakistan. And despite a reviewer's positive impression of the man and his loyalty to the U.S., he was turned down for service.
Another enlistee, Panshu Zhao, signed up after moving from China to the U.S. for school. He is now pursuing a doctorate in geography at Texas A&M University — but after the military rejected him, he told NPR, ""This is a whole disaster. This is a total mess — a big mess."""
2232,"Trump administration expands government's deportation powers""",Washington Times,7/23/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jul/5/dhs-expands-power-initiate-deportations/,"The Trump administration has expanded the government’s deportation powers, issuing guidelines urging officers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — the legal immigration agency — to begin the removal process for people who use fraudulent documents or who illegally took government benefits.
USCIS officers have always had powers to begin deportation proceedings, but in the past had usually referred cases to other parts of Homeland Security for decisions on deportation.
Now, though, the agency is flexing those powers, with guidance memos telling officers to look for instances where they can begin the deportation process for people they deem illegal immigrants.
The memos, dated June 28, tell agency employees to be on the lookout for people who apply for naturalization or other legal immigration benefit but who have criminal records, used bogus documents, lied about their applications or had abused public benefit programs.
In the past those might have been enough to reject the application, but USCIS would either drop the issue at that point or refer the case to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for possible deportation. Under the new guidelines USCIS employees are now urged to begin the deportation process themselves.
That involves issuing a Notice to Appear, or NTA, which signals the beginning of the deportation process. Someone who receives an NTA then must go before an immigration judge, has the chance to appeal, and only then is deported.
“For too long, USCIS officers uncovering instances of fraudulent or criminal activity have been limited in their ability to help ensure U.S. immigration laws are faithfully executed,” USCIS Director L. Francis Cissna said in announcing the changes.
“This updated policy equips USCIS officers with clear guidance they need and deserve to support the enforcement priorities established by the president, keep our communities safe, and protect the integrity of our immigration system from those seeking to exploit it.”
The new guidance reclaims USCIS’s role as a gatekeeper and expands the number of government employees on the lookout for deportable migrants.
“When fraud, misrepresentation, or evidence of abuse of public benefit programs is part of the record and the alien is removable, USCIS will issue an NTA upon denial of the petition or application, or other appropriate negative eligibility determination,” the guidance says.
USCIS says the move is about efficiency. In the past, it had to wait on ICE to make decisions and ICE would have to track someone down to issue them an NTA. Now, USCIS will be able to do that immediately.
One effect could be to discourage people with bogus claims from coming forward to apply, since they now run a greater risk of ending up in deportation proceedings.
People applying under the Obama-era DACA program are exempted from the new guidance, meaning illegal immigrant “Dreamers” won’t generally have to worry about being put in deportation if their claim is rejected.
The prohibition on sharing their information with ICE is also still in place, according to a second memo released Thursday.

3936,"Congratulations, You Are Now a U.S. Citizen. Unless Someone Decides Later You\xe2\x80\x99re Not.'",New York Times (Online News),7/23/2018,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/us/denaturalize-citizen-immigration.html,"MIAMI — Norma Borgoño immigrated to the United States from Peru in 1989. A single mother with two children, she set roots in the Miami suburbs, finding work as a secretary, dedicating herself to her church and, earlier this year, welcoming her first grandchild, a girl named Isabel, after Ms. Borgoño’s middle name.
She took the oath of citizenship in 2007, a step she felt would secure her status in her adopted homeland. But hers, it turns out, is not a feel-good immigrant story: The Justice Department has moved to revoke Ms. Borgoño’s citizenship, an action that could eventually force her to return to Peru.
Federal prosecutors in May filed a rare denaturalization case against Ms. Borgoño, 64, accusing her of committing fraud when she applied for citizenship and failed to disclose that she had taken part in a crime several years before she applied for citizenship — though she had not at the time been charged with it. It wasn’t until four years later, in 2011, that Ms. Borgoño pleaded guilty to helping her boss, to no benefit of her own, defraud the Export-Import Bank of the United States of $24 million.
Since President Trump took office, the number of denaturalization cases has been growing, part of a campaign of aggressive immigration enforcement that now promises to include even the most protected class of legal immigrants: naturalized citizens."
2189,Trump ramps up scrutiny of legal immigrants',The Hill,7/23/2018,,,http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/398116-trump-ramps-up-scrutiny-of-legal-immigrants,"The Trump administration is stepping up efforts to curb legal immigration, taking a series of actions in recent weeks that could lead to deportation for people already granted citizenship.
The director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) — an office established in 2003 to process immigrant applications for visas, work permits, green cards and citizenship — told The Associated Press recently that the agency is hiring dozens of lawyers and immigration officers to review cases of immigrants who are suspected of having lied to officials during the naturalization process.
ADVERTISEMENT
The office made public on July 5 a memo announcing its plan to start issuing notices to appear for a wider range of cases. Those notices, which require an immigrant to appear before an immigration judge on a certain date, can be the first step in deportation proceedings.
Experts say that policy change, coupled with what came next, could vastly expand the number of individuals being referred for removal.
The agency said last week that starting Sept. 11 its adjudicators will have the ability to outright deny applications that are missing information. That’s a departure from an Obama-era policy of sending requests for more evidence or issuing a warning of their intent to deny the application.
“The memos are really, layer by layer, going after people who are in line doing the right things,” Anastasia Tonello, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said.
The administrative changes highlight how Trump officials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsBolton book shows nastiness rules at Trump White House DOJ civil division's leader resigning The end of asylum — for now MORE and White House adviser Stephen Miller, aren’t just seeking to curtail illegal immigration — they’re also taking steps against naturalized citizens in an effort to reduce the number of foreign-born residents in the U.S.
USCIS says the policy changes are an effort to ensure the nation’s immigration laws are faithfully executed to keep communities safe and secure.
Michael Bars, an agency spokesman, said in a statement to The Hill that immigrants can always file an appeal when a benefit is denied.
But immigration experts say the changes — along with the agency’s new mission statement emphasizing the security of U.S. citizens — mark a noticeable shift in an agency that was previously focused on customer service.
“There’s a reason we set up our benefits agency separate from our enforcement agency, and it seems like a bunch of changes have been put in place to make USCIS more of an enforcement agency,” said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with Migration Policy Institute’s U.S. Immigration Policy Program. “It’s problematic and very concerning.”
USCIS called the allegation that it is transitioning to an enforcement agency false and inaccurate.
“The truth is that many open borders advocates believe the U.S. should turn a blind eye to cases of illegal immigration, fraud, human trafficking, gang activity and drug proliferation at the expense of public safety and the integrity of our laws,” Bars said.
“Each year, immigration benefits including the great privilege of citizenship are attainable for many legitimate individuals each seeking greater opportunity, prosperity, and security as newly entrusted members of society,” he said, adding that USCIS is committed to adjudicating all petitions and applications fairly, efficiently and effectively on a case-by-case basis.
The additional lawyers and immigration officials announced in June by USCIS Director L. Francis Cissna are for a new office that the agency says will serve as a centralized location to review and refer appropriate cases for denaturalization to the Department of Justice.
The cases involve individuals who had been ordered to be removed from the country and intentionally used multiple identities to defraud the government to obtain citizenship, USCIS said.
The new office is the byproduct of an investigation completed in 2016 by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) discovered in 2011 that it was missing fingerprint records of immigrants who were fugitives or convicted criminals, as well as those who had deportation orders.
The investigation found that USCIS has granted U.S. citizenship to 858 immigrants who had been ordered deported or removed under another name.
More than 2,500 naturalization cases have been determined to require an in-depth review for possible denaturalization, of which almost 100 have been referred to the Department of Justice for denaturalization, according to USCIS.
So far, six individuals have been denaturalized, meaning ICE will decide whether to pursue deportation proceedings.
With so few denaturalizations for fraud, policy experts say the new office isn’t worth the investment.
Ruth Wasem, a clinical professor of public policy at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, said most people haven’t done anything wrong.
“It’s hard not to think it’s pretty hateful to be assuming people who are trying to go through the legal process are somehow sinister,” she said."

6036,Some migrant children are reunited with parents as Trump administration misses court deadline',Los Angeles Times,7/11/2018,,,http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-deadline-separated-20180710-story.html,"The federal government on Tuesday began its first major wave of reuniting migrant children with their parents amid continued chaos, confusion and legal wrangling over when and how the rest of the thousands of families separated on the border would be brought back together.
The Trump administration said only 38 of 102 children younger than 5 had been reunited with their parents by the Tuesday deadline set by a federal judge in San Diego. The same judge has ordered that thousands of older children should be reunited by July 26.
For the record: An earlier version of this article reported that 34 children under age 5 were expected to be reunited with their families by Tuesday. Administration officials said 38 such children were to be reunited.
Government attorneys said authorities were trying to comply with the order as quickly as possible, while attorneys for the immigrant families said the government could be doing more to speed up the reunifications.
Trump administration officials appeared to soften its hard-line stance on how the detainees are treated, saying the parents of children younger than 5 would largely be released with ankle bracelet monitors rather than being detained indefinitely as a family. They declined to say whether they would similarly release the parents of the much larger group of 2,000 to 3,000 children ages 5 to 17.

The administration’s move to rely on ankle bracelets marks a return to the policy used before the administration began its method of separating parents and children caught illegally entering the country.
U.S. government is asking immigrant parents separated from their children to fill out this lengthy form »
The shift followed an order issued Monday by a federal judge in Los Angeles, rejecting the Justice Department’s request to modify a long-standing legal settlement outlining how long immigrant minors may be detained. The 1997 agreement, known as the Flores settlement, requires that minors be released “without unnecessary delay.”
In court Tuesday, Justice Department attorneys told the San Diego judge that they believed the two orders still allowed the administration to ask parents detained at the border to either waive the right to remain with their children, as recognized in the San Diego case, or waive the Flores settlement’s maximum 20-day limit that a child can be forced to spend in immigration detention.

Judge Dana Sabraw asked attorneys what happens if a parent doesn’t want to waive either right.
Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the parent would have to file a separate lawsuit claiming lack of due process.
“We are hopeful the government will do the right thing,” Gelernt said.
Carlos Holguin, an attorney who represents immigrant minors in the Los Angeles case, said the administration was forcing parents to make a tough choice.

“The families are still in a very difficult position, either remain in custody together, or separate” so their children can be released, said Holguin, who offers counsel with the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law. “The government doesn’t have to do that. They can resume the policies and practices that were prevailing a year or two ago, release families together if they show credible fear of returning to the country of origin.”
Holguin said part of the difficulty for the administration appeared to be the dearth of facilities designed to detain families as a unit.
Across the country Tuesday, dozens of children were being allowed back into their parents’ arms after weeks apart as administration officials said they were doing their best to reunite families in a safe and expeditious way.
Three Honduran fathers in Grand Rapids, Mich., who were reunited with their children, two girls and a boy, were “just holding them and hugging them and telling them that everything was fine, and that they were never going to be separated again,” immigration lawyer Abril Valdes said.

One of the fathers, Ever Reyes Mejia, walked out of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement center carrying his beaming son and the boy’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles backpack.
Meanwhile, parents who remained separated from their older children remained in limbo, plagued with heartbreak and confusion.
Two Central American mothers, whose daughters are being held in South Texas shelters, said they were told reclaiming their girls from federal government-contracted shelters could take weeks and would require jumping through numerous bureaucratic hoops. Both asked to be identified by their first names only because their asylum cases are pending.
Janet, 46, and her 15-year-old daughter Jenny were detained crossing the Rio Grande on a smuggler’s raft in late May and separated from each other. Janet was released Monday with a notice to appear in court but has been unable to be with her daughter, who remains at a shelter in San Benito, Texas.

“So much time has passed. I want to take her with me. We’ll see if they give me the chance,” she said. Officials have told the volunteers helping her, with the nonprofit Grassroots Leadership, that in order to be reunited, she would have to clear a rigorous screening process, including fingerprinting and background checks.
Isabella, 40, hasn’t seen her 17-year-old daughter Diana since they swam across the Rio Grande 40 days ago near Hidalgo, Texas.
She was released Monday on $1,500 bond without an ankle monitor. A childhood friend drove from Maryland to help her find Diana. Her daughter, who she located at a Brownsville, Texas, shelter last week, has struggled psychologically with the separation, Isabella said.
“I’m praying to God to give me my daughter soon,” she said, adding that she hopes officials will be moved by the plight of the thousands of children still separated from their families. “I think this will touch the heart of the president.”

Eight more had serious criminal records, including murder and kidnapping charges, that made them unfit to take back their own children, the government said Tuesday.
Those were among the tougher cases the government has had to sort through as it rushed to make a judge’s deadline for reuniting the youngest of the children separated in the aftermath of President Trump’s zero-tolerance border policy.
Federal officials signaled Tuesday that they were scrapping the policy for dozens of families, preparing to release them rather than detain them, as the president had promised.
Yet even with that retreat, the government was still struggling to meet the deadline imposed by Judge Dana Sabraw.
Just 38 of the original 102 separated children under age 5 were guaranteed to be reunited by Tuesday, officials said. Another 16 were on the bubble for reunification, the government said, saying it depended on whether they were able to finish out a series of checks to make sure the children weren’t heading to unsafe conditions.
Judge Sabraw told them to speed it up, saying they could cut corners on their usual process in order to get the kids back with people who claimed to be their parents.
“These are firm deadlines. They’re not aspirational goals,” the judge said during a hearing Tuesday to get an update on progress.
Judge Sabraw ruled last month that separating families violated illegal immigrant parents’ rights. He blocked separations going forward and gave the government 14 days — until Tuesday — to reunite children under 5 who’d been separated and were still in government custody. He set another deadline of July 26 for juveniles ages 5 to 17 to be reconnected.
Between 2,000 and 3,000 children separated from parents are in government custody, with 102 of them falling into this week’s under-5 deadline.
Government officials insisted they were working in good faith.
Of the 102 children under the immediate deadline, they said four had already been released by Tuesday afternoon and another 34 were about to be turned over to parents. Sixteen children were awaiting final DNA tests on people who’d cleared background checks but still needed to have their relationship confirmed, while one other parent had a criminal background check that was still being resolved.
Another 12 children belonged to parents who’d already been deported, and the government was unsure how to handle those — other than to try to reach them in their home countries. And eight parents had been released into the U.S., and needed full safety checks, the government said.
In the final 27 cases, officials say, they’ve ruled out reunification, at least for now.
Ten parents are serving time in federal or state jails or prisons and can’t be reunited until their sentences are done. One child’s parent has been missing for more than a year — and it’s possible both the child and parent are American citizens.
Eight parents had major criminal records that made them unsuitable candidates to take custody of their children, one parent was deemed a danger for child abuse, one parent lived in a home where another occupant had a child sex-abuse charge pending, and another parent has a communicable disease that must be cleared up.
Then there are five of the 102 cases where adults had claimed to be parents, but those claims were disproved once the government started to investigate by DNA tests.
Officials said those cases are evidence for why the government needs to do extensive vetting before turning children over.
“Our process may not be as quick as some would like but there is no question it is protecting children,” said Chris Meekins, a high-ranking official at the Health and Human Services Department.
In some of the toughest cases, Mr. Meekins said, they have found two instances of men who assert parentage but DNA tests come back negative.
He said it’s possible the men don’t know they aren’t the biological fathers. In those cases, if the adults are proved to be parents through other means such as birth certificates, they’ll bury the DNA results, saying it’s not their role to interfere in whatever the family situation is.
Judge Sabraw, though, was not impressed with the government’s lengthy checks.
He ordered a “streamlined approach” for vetting parents, saying DNA tests should only be used if there’s a specific reason to suspect fraud.
“The court could not have been clearer that business as usual is not acceptable,” said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer handling the case for the families on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union. “The Trump administration must get these children and parents reunited.”
In pushing to meet the deadlines the government signaled it’s ended the zero tolerance policy of holding illegal immigrants until they can be deported, at least in these cases.
Instead, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement expects to quickly release most of the parents and children. In some cases the parents will be given ankle bracelets to try to make sure they appear for their immigration court proceedings.
Matthew Albence, the executive associate director at ICE for Enforcement and Removal Operations, said they don’t have high hopes that will lead to the people being deported when the time comes. He said ICE released 80,000 people under alternatives to detention last year, and just 2,400 were actually deported.
“That is not an effective removal tool,” he said.
Trump critics, though, said deportations aren’t as important as reuniting children and parents — and they said it was a black eye on the Trump administration that it missed the court’s deadlines.
“This is an abject failure and a betrayal of American values,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat. “Congress has a moral obligation to stop this, since the Trump administration has demonstrated that it lacks the competency to do so.:”
The government’s struggles to reunite the first 102 children led critics to say they have no faith the reunification of more than 2,000 juveniles 5 and older will be smoother.
Federal officials declined to give reporters a timeline for those reunifications Tuesday, saying they would wait for more guidance from the court.

3429,Judge rules that Trump administration has been wrongly detaining asylum seekers',USA TODAY,7/3/2018,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/07/02/judge-rules-trump-administration-has-been-wrongly-detaining-asylum-seekers/753151002/,"A federal judge ruled on Monday that the Department of Homeland Security has violated its own policies by refusing to release most asylum-seekers from immigration detention even if they are likely to win their asylum case.
District Judge James Boasberg in the District of Columbia ordered the department to stop making blanket determinations against most asylum-seekers and resume the long-standing practice of deciding each applicant's detention status on a case by case basis.
Boasberg pointed to data provided by the nine plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit to show how dramatically detention determinations have changed under President Donald Trump.
In recent years, Homeland Security allowed more than 90 percent of asylum-seekers who had proven they have a ""credible fear"" of returning to their home country to be released in the U.S. to await their final hearing before an immigration judge. Since President Donald Trump took office, those rates plummeted to 8 percent in Los Angeles, 2 percent in Detroit, and 0 percent in El Paso, Philadelphia and Newark. the locations where the plaintiffs are being held.
""Although Benjamin Disraeli decried 'lies, damn lies, and statistics,' the numbers here are irrefutable,"" Boasberg wrote. ""The dramatic departure in parole-grant rates from years past has not been explained in any way by (the government).""

Foreigners can be granted asylum if they prove they have a ""credible fear"" that they will be persecuted in their home country based on their race, religion, nationality, or are members of a particular social group or political opinion.
That system has come under attack by the Trump administration since
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has claimed that the asylum system is being abused by foreigners who know how to game the system to win entry to the U.S. He has also argued that current asylum laws are too broad, announcing last month that victims of domestic violence or gang violence are no longer automatic grounds to win asylum in the U.S.
Boasberg's ruling did not address that change. Instead, the judge issued a nationwide, preliminary injunction that requires the Department of Homeland Security to abide by its own 2009 directive that requires individualized reviews of each case.
The judge ruled that the department has been making blanket detention decisions, contrary to the 2009 directive.
""To mandate that ICE provide these baseline procedures to those entering our country – individuals who have often fled violence and persecution to seek safety on our shores – is no great judicial leap,"" wrote Boasberg, who was first appointed to the D.C. Circuit by President George W. Bush. ""Rather, the issuance of injunctive relief in this case serves only to hold Defendants accountable to their own governing policies and to ensure that Plaintiffs receive the protections they are due under the Parole Directive.""
The lawsuits was filed in March by legal groups representing nine jailed asylum-seekers.
The plaintiffs include an ethics teacher from Haiti who was attacked after teaching his class about government corruption, a Venezuelan who was threatened for participating in marches opposing the country's communist government, and a gay Honduran man who was threatened at gunpoint.
One has been held in U.S. custody for over two years. Others have been held for months at a time, claiming they have received little explanation for why they continue to be detained.
The judge did not order that the plaintiffs be released from custody, only that Homeland Security officials must show that they are making fair detention determinations for each person. The main grounds for denying parole to an asylum-seeker are that they pose a public safety threat or represent a flight risk.
The practical effect, according to attorneys who filed the lawsuit, is that the Trump administration can no longer use indefinite detention as a deterrent for would-be asylum seekers.
""This ruling means the Trump administration cannot use indefinite detention as a weapon to punish and deter asylum seekers,"" said Michael Tan, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.
The Department of Homeland Security said it not not comment on pending litigation."
4632,"Judge rules DHS must consider detained asylum-seekers' parole on case-by-case basis""",Fox News (Online),7/3/2018,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/07/02/judge-rules-dhs-must-consider-detained-asylum-seekers-parole-on-case-by-case-basis.html,"A federal judge in Washington, D.C. ruled Monday that the federal government must consider on a case-by-case basis whether asylum-seekers who have been detained represent a flight risk or credible danger to the public.
The ruling by U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg blocks the Trump administration from keeping asylum-seekers in custody until their immigration proceedings are dealt with.
""This ruling means the Trump administration cannot use indefinite detention as a weapon to punish and deter asylum seekers,"" Michael Tan, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project.
The ACLU, the Center for Gender and Reugee Studes and Human Rights First sued the administration on behalf of nine asylum-seekers, claiming that five U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices had ""almost entirely"" stopped granting asylum-seekers so-called ""humanitarian parole.""
The ICE offices singled out in the lawsuit are in Detroit, El Paso, Los Angeles, Newark and Philadelphia.
The ACLU claimed that the indefinite detention policy violated the Constitution, immigration law, and the Department of Homeland Security's own policy dating back to 2009.
Boasberg agreed, writing that he was doing ""no more than hold the Government accountable to its own policy, which recently has been honored more in the breach than the observance.""
""To mandate that ICE provide these baseline procedures to those entering our country – individuals who have often fled violence and persecution to seek safety on our shores – is no great judicial leap,"" he added.
There was no immediate comment from the Department of Homeland Security or the Department of Justice.

AD
The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups sued in March after finding detention rates at the offices surged to 96 percent in the first eight months after President Trump took office in 2017, up from less than 10 percent in 2013.
AD
The ACLU says the mass imprisonment of people seeking refuge while awaiting immigration court hearings stems from policies promoted by Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions that amount to a deterrent to using the asylum provision. The policy, the ACLU argued, unlawfully denies asylum seekers as a group based on only one of the factors used to assess the danger an individual poses: how long they have been in the United States.
“As the events of recent months make clear, the question of how this nation will treat those who come to our shores seeking refuge generates enormous debate,” Boasberg wrote in a 38-page opinion, an allusion to the administration’s family-separation policy recently implemented and then abandoned amid international condemnation.
AD
“This Opinion does no more than hold the Government accountable to its own policy, which recently has been honored more in the breach than the observance. Having extended the safeguards of the Parole Directive to asylum seekers, ICE must now ensure that such protections are realized,” Boasberg said.
AD
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of nine detained asylum seekers from Haiti, Venezuela and other countries who were initially determined to have credible stories and have been jailed for up to two years awaiting a hearing before an immigration judge, lawyers said. Two have been granted asylum and released since the case was filed in March, said attorneys with the ACLU and the Covington & Burling law firm.
The court action named the Department of Homeland Security and its sub-agency ICE, which detains immigrants, and the Justice Department, which runs the immigration courts where immigrants can seek bond hearings.
AD
The five ICE field offices cited in the lawsuit are Detroit, El Paso, Los Angeles, Newark and Philadelphia, which handle about one-fourth of the nationwide caseload. Plaintiffs said the government at an earlier stage identified nearly 800 class members, a figure they said has now exceeded 1,000.
AD
“This ruling means the Trump administration cannot use indefinite detention as a weapon to punish and deter asylum seekers,” said Michael Tan, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.
Hardy Vieux, legal director for Human Rights First, which also backed the lawsuit, said the decision will have “an enormous impact” on asylum seekers who pose no risk, adding, “It is a rejection of the Trump administration’s blanket policy of denying parole to those seeking protection in this country.”
AD
A Justice Department spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment or to a question about whether the government will appeal.
Boasberg cited a 2009 Department of Homeland Security directive still in force that says the federal government must consider person by person whether an undocumented asylum seeker poses a flight risk or danger to the community, or can be released from detention once they have shown a “credible fear” of persecution in their home country.
AD
Boasberg granted provisional class status to asylum seekers. While the lawsuit is ongoing, the judge barred ICE from detaining applicants for more than seven days without doing a personalized review of their asylum claim, and giving specific written explanations for anyone the government says must be held.
AD
The Justice Department said the case should be thrown out arguing that asylum detention decisions are the sole discretion of government agencies and insulated from court review to prevent asylum applicants from flooding courts with lawsuits.
ACLU Deputy Legal Director Cecelia Wang said the lawsuit targeted another area where the Trump administration has been using “inhumane and illegal” policies of detaining border-crossers to deter others.
Asylum is a provision in federal law that allows foreign nationals to seek permanent residency and eventually, citizenship, if they have a fear of persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or “membership in a particular social group,” a broad category that has included people fleeing gang activity, domestic violence or other circumstances including torture or death.

6800,Thousands turn out in cities across nation to protest separation of illegal immigrant families',TheBlaze.com,7/1/2018,,,https://www.theblaze.com/news/2018/06/30/thousands-turn-out-in-cities-across-nation-to-protest-separation-of-illegal-immigrant-families,"Thousands of protesters marched in the streets of cities across America to protest the nation’s immigration policies and call for the reunification of parents and children who were separated at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to published reports.
More than one week ago, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to end the practice, but many families still remain separated as the government sorts through their cases.
How many total protests were there?
In all, an estimated 600 protests were scheduled in cities spanning from New York City to Los Angeles. The marchers included open-border advocates as well as conservatives who say families should not be separated.
The total number of protesters could rise to hundreds of thousands, according to some reports. Social media was flooded with photos of those participating and watching the demonstrations.
“Thousands” also turned out in New York City, Boston, Washington, El Paso, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, according to an Associated Press running tally of the protests.
In New York City, protesters shouted “Shut detention down,” a reference to demonstrations held at ICE offices across the country.
Barry Hooper of San Francisco told the Associated Press he attended the protest with his wife and two daughters to “let the president know that this is not acceptable.”
Liliana, his 7-year-old daughter, held a sign she made that read, “Stop the separation.”
Protesters in San Francisco carried flags and signs with with slogans that read, “Deport Trump,” and “I Really Care, Do You?” – a jab at the words written across a jacket the first lady during a visit to an immigrant detention center. Amid a global furor over the immigrant crisis, Melania Trump wore a jacket with the words, “I really don’t care, do u?” written across the back in large white letters.
Trump later said the message on his wife's jacket was directed at the “Fake News Media.”
Celebrities and politicians who oppose Trump were among those participating in a demonstration in Los Angeles, according to the Associated Press.
California Democrats who turned out for the event included Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) Migrant children taken from their parents will suffer lifelong trauma, Harris said.
A rally near the city hall in Portland, Maine was so large that police shut down streets as a reported 2,000 people “chanted, cheered and prayed,” the wire service reported.
In downtown Denver, an estimated 4,000 people attended a boisterous rally. Some of the protesters wore foil blankets, a symbol of similar blankets they gave to children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Others carried signs that included the messages: “Keep the kids, deport the racists” and “Break walls, build families.”
Elsewhere, smaller groups banded together in city parks and downtown squares in virtually every state. Some carried tiny white onesies with the words, ""What if it was your child?"" and ""No family jails,"" according to reports.
The rallies were funded by the American Civil Liberties Union, MoveOn.org, the National Domestic Workers Alliance, and The Leadership Conference, Fox News reported.
Local organizers did most of the planning and coordination efforts. Many of them used informal networks that formed during the worldwide women's marches that happened on Trump's inauguration and its anniversary, the report stated.
What did Trump say?
As the protests were underway, Trump doubled-down on the immigration issue through a series of tweets, including:"
5051,Protesters across U.S. call on Trump to reunite immigrant families',Reuters,7/1/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-protest/protesters-across-u-s-call-on-trump-to-reunite-immigrant-families-idUSKBN1JQ0TP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of protesters marched in cities across the United States on Saturday to demand the Trump administration reverse an immigration crackdown that has separated children from parents at the U.S-Mexico border and led to plans for military-run detention camps.
Outside the White House, protesters waved “Families Belong Together” signs and chanted “Shame!” as religious leaders and activists urged the administration to be more welcoming of foreigners and to reunite families.
“The way they treat families, the way they treat immigrants, that’s not America,” said protester Aneice Germain of President Donald Trump’s tough stance on immigration, a cornerstone of his 2016 election campaign and his presidency. Trump was out of town at a golf club he owns in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Trump says illegal immigration fosters crime and he implemented a “zero tolerance” policy in May to prosecute all immigrants apprehended for entering illegally. That led to the separation of more than 2,000 children from their parents, causing an outcry this month, even from some allies of the Republican president.
In a rare retreat on an issue that fires up his conservative base, Trump on June 20 ordered officials to detain families together.
Thousands of protesters in New York marched across the Brooklyn Bridge bearing signs with slogans like “Make America Humane Again” and “Immigrants Are Welcome Here.” On the U.S.-Mexico border, demonstrators partially blocked a bridge connecting El Paso, Texas with Ciudad Juarez in Mexico.
In Chicago, thousands gathered to march toward the offices of federal immigration authorities. “I’m here because families belong together,” said Cindy Curry of Westchester, Illinois.A federal judge has ordered families be reunited and the administration asked the military to house immigrant families, leading the Pentagon to mull the construction of soft-sided camp facilities.
Organizers estimated 30,000 people had gathered in central Washington. The peaceful protest appeared to be the largest pro-immigration demonstration in the U.S. capital since at least 2010, when activists rallied to pressure then-President Barack Obama and Congress to overhaul the U.S. immigration system.
A splinter group of several dozen protesters in Washington went to protest at what they said was the residence of Stephen Miller, a White House adviser known for his hardline views on immigration. It was the latest in a string of public protests against Trump administration officials.
They held up a sign saying “Stephen Miller, We Know Where You Sleep.”
Since taking office in 2017, Trump has overseen an increase in arrests of people suspected of being in the country illegally. His administration is also approving fewer family visas.
Immigration has been on the rise in America and across much of the developed world for decades, roiling politics in recent years in Germany, Britain and the United States.

Immigrants made up about one in 20 U.S. residents in 1970. By 2016, their share rose to about one in seven, according the U.S. Census Bureau.
On Twitter on Saturday, Trump criticized the handful of Democratic politicians who have called for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency known as ICE to be eliminated.
“You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements,” he wrote in part of the post addressed to ICE employees."
5407,Protests Across U.S. Call for End to Migrant Family Separations',New York Times (Online News),7/1/2018,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/30/us/politics/trump-protests-family-separation.html,"Some showed up because they said they were angry; others, because they said they had not been angrier sooner. Maggie Mason, a new mother, said that for two weeks she could not go on Facebook because of news stories about children in detention centers, such as the audio published by ProPublica of immigrant children crying after being separated from their parents. Now, with her 7-week-old baby sleeping in the stroller next to her, she said it was time to come out.
Over the past month, marches across the country have cropped up, adding to the pressure on the Trump administration to yield to calls to end the practice of splitting up or detaining families.
“The idea of kids in cages and asylum seekers in prisons and moms being separated from breast-feeding children, this is just beyond politics, it really is just about right and wrong,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington State. On Thursday, she was arrested with more than 500 other women who occupied a Senate office building as part of a Women’s March protest against Mr. Trump’s immigration policy.
Ms. Jayapal said she has visited a federal prison just south of Seattle and met with 174 women and several dozen men who had been transferred from the Texas border. She said she was moved by the stories of asylum seekers and parents — stories of family members killed, of children left behind, of violent physical attacks and domestic abuse.
“I promised them that I would get their stories out and I promised them I would do everything I could to reunite their families,” Ms. Jayapal said."

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio both called for the dismantling of ICE this week amid backlash over President Donald Trump's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy.
""I don't think ICE today is working as intended,"" Gillibrand said on CNN Thursday evening. ""I believe that it has become a deportation force, and I think you should separate the criminal justice from the immigration issues. And I think you should reimagine ICE under a new agency with a very different mission and take those two missions out.""
On Friday, Gillibrand echoed her sentiment on Facebook, writing ""We need to abolish ICE.""
De Blasio said in a radio interview with WNYC Friday, ""ICE's time has come and gone.""
He added, ""We should abolish ICE. We should create something better, something different.""
ICE spokeswoman Liz Johnson condemned calls to abolish the agency as ""dangerously misguided.""
""Instead of being insulted with politically-motivated attacks, the men and women of ICE should be praised for risking life and limb every day in the name of national security and public safety,"" Johnson said in a statement. She added that ICE arrested more than 5,000 immigrants who entered the country illegally in New York over the last year,
""removing public safety threats from the streets.""
Both Democrats' comments came after Tuesday's primary win by progressive, Democratic Socialist candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over Democratic incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley for New York's 14th congressional district.
Ocasio-Cortez is one of many progressives who has called for ICE to be abolished.
On Monday, Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., said he would introduce legislation to eliminate the agency.

ICE has been in the center of the storm over family separations at the border. The Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" immigration edict had ICE arresting undocumented immigrant adults entering the country without using legal entry points. Children with those adults were then placed with the Department of Health and Human Services.
President Donald Trump ordered the separations halted, but the details on what is next are being worked out.
Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor at Cornell University Law School who has written extensively on immigration law, told USA TODAY earlier this week that ICE isn't going anywhere soon.
""Even if the Democrats take control of Congress in November, the chances of abolishing ICE are slim to none,"" he said.

In an interview to be aired Sunday with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures,” Trump was asked what he thinks about more Democrats lining up to call for the agency’s abolition.
“Well I hope they keep thinking about it. Because they’re going to get beaten so badly,” he said. “You know ICE, these are the guys that go in and take MS-13, and they take them out. Because they’re much tougher than MS-13, like by a factor of 10. And these are the ones – you get rid of ICE you’re going to have a country that you’re going to be afraid to walk out of your house.”
“I love that issue if they're going to actually do that,” he added.
Calls to “abolish ICE,” once limited to the far-left parts of the Democratic Party base, have shifted into the mainstream mostly in response to the Trump administration’s tough policies on illegal immigration -- particularly the “zero tolerance” policy on detaining all illegal border crossers.
In New York, far-left primary challenger and ICE opponent Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's shocked the party’s establishment by beating Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y. In the days after, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Mayor Bill de Blasio have added their support to the cause.
'ABOLISH ICE' GOES MAINSTREAM AS GILLIBRAND, DE BLASIO BACK CALLS
""I believe that [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] has become a deportation force … and that's why I believe you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works,"" Gillibrand said in a CNN interview Thursday night.
“We should abolish ICE,” de Blasio said Friday morning on WNYC radio. His Democratic colleague in Albany, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, is also facing pressure to back such calls after primary challenger Cynthia Nixon has called ICE a ""terrorist organization.""
Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif has said that the U.S. should consider “starting from scratch” while Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., announced on Monday that he would be introducing a bill to abolish the agency.
But, while it was unlikely to gain much traction on the right, Trump also tweeted on Saturday that he was backing ICE agents and that there was “zero chance” of ICE being abolished.
“To the great and brave men and women of ICE, do not worry or lose your spirit. You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements,” he said. “So brave! The radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police. Zero chance, It will never happen!”
Trump is joining a number of Republicans and immigration hardliners who are welcoming the Democratic shift on the issue, believing that it spells electoral victory for the GOP outside of Democratic enclaves like New York and California.
""Based on the last week, Democrats apparently want to campaign on open borders, mass migration, & abolishing ICE,"" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., tweeted this week. ""Give them points for honesty. Let's vote."""
4118,"The movement to 'Abolish ICE' is heating up -- and going mainstream""",CNN (Web News),6/30/2018,,,https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/30/politics/abolish-ice-movement-gaining-support-democrats/index.html,"(CNN) Calls to eliminate the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, for years relegated to the far-left corners of progressive activism, have been thrust this week into the mainstream of Democratic politics.
Cracks in the dam became visible 10 days ago , when a group of demonstrators confronted Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen at a Mexican restaurant in Washington. They called for an end to the Trump administration policy that resulted in separating migrant families at the border and, as the viral protest heated up, began to chant: ""Abolish ICE!""
Less than two weeks on, the demand -- a favored meme on the left -- has gone from a progressive fringe cause, mostly ignored even by some of the most liberal lawmakers, to a political message being embraced by a growing roster of influential national Democrats.
Fueling its sudden ascent have been a series of recent shocks to the system. On Tuesday, US House candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez delivered a stunning Democratic primary upset in New York after campaigning on abolishing the agency, which was formed in 2003 as part of a post-9/11 federal overhaul that created the Department of Homeland Security.
Two days after Ocasio-Cortez's primary, New York's Kirsten Gillibrand became the first senator and potential 2020 candidate to announce her support for the agency's elimination. Less than 12 hours later, on Friday morning, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio joined the chorus , telling WNYC's Brian Lehrer, ""ICE's time has come and gone.""
""I don't think ICE today is working as intended,"" Gillibrand said Thursday night on CNN's ""Cuomo PrimeTime."" ""I believe that it has become a deportation force, and I think you should separate the criminal justice from the immigration issues.""
Thank you, @NYCMayor, for joining the call that seems the separation of children and violation of human rights as an inexcusable bright red line in the United States of America. https://t.co/5Dwxq0XJ9T — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018) June 29, 2018
In a Facebook post on Saturday, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren wrote, ""The President's deeply immoral actions have made it obvious that we need to rebuild our immigration system from top to bottom, starting by replacing ICE with something that reflects our values,"" a line that mirrored her statements in a speech at a protest in Boston.
The rapid escalation was years in the making.
Progressive immigration rights activists -- during both Republican and Democratic administrations -- have come to view ICE as a rogue agency that terrorized immigrant communities. Calls for its dissolution, once rare, are spreading.
A group of 19 agents with its Homeland Security Investigations unit, which deals with complex investigations including transnational crime, recently wrote a letter to Nielsen asking her to break up the agency amid what they described as a debilitating conflation of their work with ICE's deportation activities. Concerns over the public backlash to actions by the Enforcement and Removal Operations division were, they wrote, making HSI's work impossible.
In their message -- first reported by The Texas Observer -- the agents reported that some jurisdictions had agreed only to ""partner with HSI as long the 'ICE' name is excluded from any public-facing information.""
On Capitol Hill, Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin is now working with fellow Democratic Reps. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state and Adriano Espaillat of New York on legislation to eliminate the agency.
In an interview, Pocan said a recent series of aggressive actions by ICE had led him to conclude that it was effectively serving as President Donald Trump's ""own political police force"" -- a tool for creating a sense of crisis to help build support for a border wall and other hardline immigration policies.
For Pocan, Trump's call on Sunday to return immigrants who enter the country illegally without judicial proceedings was the last straw.
""The culmination of all those things, going to the border and then when the President started talking about getting rid of due process, was it,"" he said. ""You're just kind of like, all right, this has gone way astray, and we need to start over.""
But there is dissent now in the Democratic ranks.
Leading progressives, like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and -- until Saturday -- Warren, have stopped short of calling for ICE to be terminated outright and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has circulated talking points advising caution -- arguing in a memo obtained by CNN that ""abolishing ICE without changing President Trump's disastrous immigration policy will not solve the problem."" They're not alone. Some progressives on the Hill worry that wielding the ""Abolish ICE"" banner would be a political gift to Trump and his allies, and that Democrats should consider a more nuanced approach.
Republicans are casting progressive calls to abolish the agency and the recent momentum in the Democratic Party as a move to the far left, evidence that Democrats are weak on border security and immigration enforcement.
""Recent calls to abolish ICE are dangerously misguided,"" agency spokeswoman Jennifer D. Elzea said in an email. ""Instead of being insulted with politically-motivated attacks, the men and women of ICE should be praised for risking life and limb every day in the name of national security and public safety.""
Activists and progressive leaders are pressing on, becoming more aggressive in their push to abolish the agency, an effort many in the movement view as both a way to open up the debate over decades of bipartisan US immigration policy and, crucially, win elections.
""The Democratic Party had a reckoning about the crime bill, financial deregulation and about welfare reform, but it never really had a reckoning about their complicity in creating both the intellectual framework for this sort of policy,"" said Sean McElwee, a leading activist in the anti-ICE movement and early supporter of Ocasio-Cortez's campaign. He cited the 28-year-old Democratic socialist's unapologetic embrace of the issue as a key factor in her Tuesday triumph.
""She had an actual campaign strategy that revolved around ICE, and it was very smart, because (incumbent Rep. Joe) Crowley was weak on immigration and she knew that he would never be able to get where he needed to be to win that primary,"" McElwee said. ""So she just hammered him on it. She didn't shy away from saying it. She put it in her ads. She ran on the issue. She challenged him in the debate. I think 'Abolish ICE' is where it is today because of her leadership.""
Efforts to further escalate the fight beyond the electoral realm are already in motion. The Democratic Socialists of America, which reported its largest spike in new, dues-paying members since Trump's election on the day after Ocasio-Cortez's win, are planning a national campaign to ramp up the pressure.

Maria Svart, the group's national director, said the organization is ready to ""apply pressure wherever possible to lift up the narrative that ICE is horrific, has no place in our communities and needs to be abolished.""
""That looks different in different places,"" she said. ""We have chapters in every state in the country, and folks are doing everything from vigils to encampment to bird-dogging to really raise this issue in the public eye and say, 'We do not submit to this.' ""
Protests have already begun to grow in size and frequency. By Friday afternoon, police in Philadelphia had made six arrests outside the city's ICE office amid a heated demonstration, as crowds chanted, ""I'd rather go to jail than go to a detention center.""
Philadelphia City Council member Helen Gym recorded and tweeted out video of the scenes.

Activists are also seeking to expand the moral dimension of the fight. Hartford City Councilwoman Wildaliz Bermudez, of the Working Families Party, said the visceral nature of reporting from the border during the height of the family separation crisis pushed the movement toward a tipping point.
She likened the situation to what followed the white supremacist rallies last summer in Charlottesville, Virginia.
""It has to be a unified front (in response to ICE),"" Bermudez said, ""because like when you have people chanting on the street, 'You will not replace us,' they're not just talking about Jews. They're talking about everyone."""

The president's suggestion was quickly criticized by groups like the ACLU, which said what he was calling for was illegal.
“What President Trump has suggested here is both illegal and unconstitutional,” Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, told the AP. “Any official who has sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws should disavow it unequivocally.”
The House is expected to vote on immigration legislation this week, but Trump has signaled the lawmakers are ""wasting their time.""
""Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!"" he wrote on Twitter Friday."

He's been doing it from the moment he announced his run for president, when he insulted Latino immigrants as rapists. It continued through the campaign as he endorsed torture, summary executions and banning Muslims from the country. His ongoing paeans to ruthless dictators from Russia's Vladimir Putin to the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte to his recent love fest with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un appear to show a genuine admiration and respect for the most ruthless and violent tyrants on the planet.
Trump admires those men for their willingness and ability to mercilessly rule their countries with an iron fist. His most recent comment about Kim, for instance, even betrays a little envy:
Advertisement:
Hey, he is the head of a country, and I mean he is the strong head. Don't let anyone think anything different. He speaks, and his people sit up at attention. I want my people to do the same.
He later said he was kidding, but it really didn't seem that way. He had absurdly stated a couple of days earlier that Kim's ""country does love him, his people, you see the fervor. They have a great fervor."" He was apparently unconcerned that the ""fervor"" is coerced under threat of imprisonment or death.
Trump plans to spend $30 million to try to create some of that fervor for himself next fall:
Trump was said to have loved North Korean state TV, commenting on how positive the female anchor was about Kim Jong Un. He told former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee last week that American media criticism of his summit meeting with Kim was ""almost treasonous."" That's not the first time he has suggested that failing to praise him adequately amounts to treason. When Democrats did not applaud his alleged achievements during the State of the Union address, he asked a rally crowd, ""Can we call that treason? Why not? They certainly didn't seem to love our country very much.""

This is a man who insisted that everyone always call him ""Mr. Trump"" when he was in business and always demanded strict formality, even among his family members. As president he routinely gathers his cabinet and other members of the government to sit around the big table and robotically extol his virtues. Recall this little pageant from his first cabinet meeting:
Then there's the downright bizarre order to create a new branch of government called the ""Space Force"" (against the advice and opinion of every one of his military advisers) and single-handedly upending the international order with a fatuous ""philosophy"" that the U.S. is running a protection racket and must be paid an ever-increasing ransom by countries who've been our allies since World War II. In these cases and many others, Trump is making unilateral moves without regard to any previous understandings or agreements, whether informal or subject to domestic and international law.
Over the last few months he has cast off anyone in the White House who might have attempted to rein in his worst impulses and is making decisions entirely by the seat of his pants. His authoritarian instincts are no longer just confined to the photo-ops. People around him who share those instincts are growing in influence, particularly senior adviser Stephen Miller, who drafted Trump's first executive order banning travelers from majority Muslim countries. Recall what Miller told John Dickerson on ""Face the Nation"" in February of 2017, when asked whether the White House had learned anything from the experience:

Well, I think that it's been an important reminder to all Americans that we have a judiciary that has taken far too much power and become, in many cases, a supreme branch of government. One unelected judge in Seattle cannot remake laws for the entire country. I mean this is just crazy, John, the idea that you have a judge in Seattle say that a foreign national living in Libya has an effective right to enter the United States is -- is -- is beyond anything we've ever seen before. The end result of this, though, is that our opponents, the media and the whole world will soon see as we begin to take further actions, that the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.
That too was laughed off at the time. He sounded like a North Korean general. No American could possibly take that seriously, right?
But after all the drama, all the turnover and all the Sturm und Drang of the past year and half, Miller is still there at the right hand of the president. He was obviously instrumental, along with his old boss Jeff Sessions and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, in crafting the ""zero-tolerance"" border policy with all that has stemmed from it. And he's obviously whispering sweet somethings about unfettered presidential power in Trump's ears.

On Sunday the president tweeted this, sending shock waves though the media and the political system:
All this is more thought out than it seems. More than a month ago, Trump was telling Brian Kilmeade on ""Fox & Friends"" that he wanted to eliminate due process at the border:
How do you hire thousands of people to be a judge? So it's ridiculous, we're going to change the system. We have no choice for the good of our country. Other countries have what's called security people. People who stand there and say, ""You can't come in."" We have thousands of judges and they need thousands of more judges. The whole system is corrupt. It's horrible. . . . Whoever heard of a system where you put people through trials? Where do these judges come from?
There is the U.S. Constitution, of course. And laws and international treaties and basic human decency. But Donald Trump does not respect of those things. He is essentially proposing that the Border Patrol and ICE should be allowed to deport anyone they want, since the whole reason for due process is to adjudicate the government's assertion of guilt. If there's no due process there's no way of knowing whether these ""people who stand there and say you can't come in"" are following the law themselves. Harvard professor Laurence Tribe, a scholar of constitutional law, told the New York Times:

Trump is making the tyrannical claim that he has the right to serve as prosecutor, judge and jury with respect to all those who enter our country. That is a breathtaking assertion of unbounded power — power without any plausible limit.
That's what Kim Jong Un has. Trump would like to have that too. Stephen Miller believes he already does, and that we will all soon see that ""it will not be questioned."" I don't think anyone should be laughing anymore. They aren't joking."

US President Donald Trump has called for speedy deportations that bypass any judicial process in a tweet on Sunday.
""When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came,"" Mr Trump wrote.
His comments come days after Mr Trump reversed a policy to separate migrant children from their parents following fierce backlash at home and abroad.
More than 2,300 children were separated from their parents in May and June.
As of May, all migrants who cross the US border illegally face criminal prosecution under the ""zero tolerance"" policy.
The president did not make the distinction between economic migrants and those seeking asylum.
Mr Trump has faced criticism, including from his own Republican Party, for his choice of language on Twitter.
When he earlier said illegal immigrants threatened ""to pour into and infest our Country"", Republican congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen tweeted back at him saying his ""baseless rhetoric"" was ""repugnant"" and dehumanised those looking for a better life.
US immigration officials say 2,342 children were separated from 2,206 parents from 5 May to 9 June.

On 20 June, Mr Trump backed down from his support for the policy and signed an executive order ending the practice of separating families.
He said at the time: ""I did not like the sight or feeling of families being separated.""
Mr Trump's directive allows for long-term detention of immigrant children (albeit with their parents), which violates federal law that limits child detention to 20 days.
Tougher language after softened policy
Chris Buckler, BBC Washington Correspondent
A public outcry over migrant children being separated from their parents, forced Donald Trump to soften his immigration policy.
But since then, in a series of speeches, he has called for tougher laws - and claimed America's current legislation is laughed at by the rest of the world.
His latest comments on Twitter go even further.
He says that everyone found illegally trying to cross the border should be returned to their own country immediately - without involving judges or holding court cases.
Political opponents will be furious that that's even been suggested but President Trump clearly believes his supporters back his hardline stance.
Following Mr Trump's election in 2016, the numbers of migrants held or detained entry while crossing the border had dropped significantly.
However, since February 2018, the number of migrants crossing the border illegally is up, with arrests last month more than double those in May 2017.
While illegal crossings cannot be accurately counted, border arrests are used as a measure of illegal border crossings."
5364,"Trump hosts 'Angel Families' to highlight crime by illegal immigrants""",Washington Times,6/23/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jun/22/trump-meet-families-loved-ones-killed-illegals/,"President Trump highlighted “American victims of illegal immigration” on Friday, hosting families of people killed by people who immigrated to the U.S. illegally to tell their stories and hitting back at critics of his rescinded policy that separated some children from their parents who crossed the border illegally.
“These are the American citizens permanently separated from their loved ones,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. “These are the families the media ignores. These are the stories that Democrats and people that are weak on immigration don’t want to discuss.”
He was surrounded on a stage by so-called “Angel” families who lost loved ones to violence by immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally. Many of the parents held large photographs of their dead children.
Referring to the furor over separating children from their parents at the border, in all but a few cases temporarily for investigative purposes, Mr. Trump emphasized repeatedly that the families gathered with him had lost their loved ones forever.
“They’re not separated for a day, or two days,” Mr. Trump said. “They’re permanently separated, because they were killed by criminal illegal aliens.”
One of the parents, Steve Ronnebeck, talked about his 21-year-old son Grant, who was shot and killed for a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store.
“You don’t hear these stories, and some of our media won’t talk to you about it,” Mr. Ronnebeck said. “But this is permanent separation.”
He said he places a Christmas tree on his son’s grave each year.
Laura Wilkerson of Pearland, Texas, recounted the story of her son Josh, who was tortured and killed in 2010.
“None of our kids had a minute to say goodbye,” she said. “We weren’t lucky enough to be separated for five days, or 10 days. We’re separated permanently. We can never have them back on this Earth.”
She added, “We can’t speak to them, we can’t Skype with them,” referring to outrage over migrant children who have been separated from their parents being able to speak with them on the phone only twice a week.
Several family members urged the audience and Mr. Trump to support their grass-roots organization, Fight Sanctuary State, to encourage state and local authorities to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement agents instead of shielding illegal immigrants.
“If we don’t kill this in California, it will spread,” said Drew Rosenberg, who lost his son, of the sanctuary-city and -state movement. “It’s a death sentence for American law-abiding citizens.”
Sabine Durden, a legal immigrant from Germany, told the story of her Dominic, 30, who was killed in Moreno Valley, California, in 2012 when his motorbike was hit by an immigrant from Guatemala, who was living illegally in the U.S. and had prior convictions including two DUIs.
“It took me five years to become a citizen, a proud citizen,” she said. “And I didn’t drag my son … over borders, through deserts. I didn’t place him in harm’s way. I came here the right way.”
She said the man who killed her son had been deported once, but returned to the U.S. and enjoyed sanctuary in Riverside, California.
“The judge, the DA, they knew who he was,” she said. “They gave him probation after his second DUI. Five weeks later, he killed my child. The public needs to know, and they deserve to know, that this could happen to each one of you at any given second.”
After the death of her only child, Ms. Durden said she was going to kill herself, until Mr. Trump announced his candidacy for president in 2015.
“President Trump, coming down that escalator that day and talking about illegal immigration, stopped me in my track,” she said. “And I thank President Trump, Vice President [Mike Pence] … I thank everybody out here. Make sure you get our stories out.”
Showing the audience a locket, she said: “I brought my son. This is what I have left — his ashes. I wear his ashes in a locket. This is how I get to hug my son. So remember, when you go and hug your kids, that there are many of us, thousands of us, who don’t get to do that any more. Let’s work together and get this done — all politicians. I don’t care what side you’re on. You don’t want your child in a casket or in an urn.”
Mr. Trump said he invited the families to the White House “because the news media has overlooked their stories.”
“I want the American people to hear from them directly,” he said. “For years their pain was met with silence … but no more. Their loved ones have not died in vain. We will secure our borders. Eventually, the word will get out.”
Mr. Trump cited statistics of crime committed by immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally, including 600,000 criminal offenses committed by more than 250,000 migrants over the past seven years in Texas alone. He also noted that 15,000 Americans died of heroin overdoses in 2016, with 90 percent of heroin coming across the southern border.
The president also again criticized Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland, California, who alerted immigrants who crossed into the U.S. illegally to a federal raid earlier this year to thwart their capture. He mistakenly referred to her as the mayor of San Diego.
“What are they going to do about looking at her, by the way?” Mr. Trump said. “I’ve been asking this question for four weeks.”
Among the “Angel” family members invited by the White House were:
• Agnes Gibboney, who lost her son Ronald da Silva after he was shot and killed by a gang member, who crossed the border illegally.
• Juan Pina, who lost his 14-year-old daughter Christy Sue in 1990, allegedly at the hands of a Mexican national who raped and killed her. Her alleged killer was extradited from Mexico last month.
• Michelle Wilson-Root, whose 21-year old daughter Sarah was killed in 2016 following a vehicular accident allegedly caused by Edwin Mejia — who had entered the country illegally and, as a result of “catch-and-release” loopholes, was released into the U.S. interior as an unaccompanied minor. According to media reports, Mejia’s blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit.
• Sabine Durden, who lost her son Dominic, a sheriff’s dispatcher, following a fatal vehicular accident in Moreno Valley, California.
• Mary Ann Mendoza, who lost her son, Mesa Police Sgt. Brandon Mendoza, in 2014 following a vehicular accident with a migrant who was allegedly driving drunk at three times the legal limit.
• Billy and Kathy Inman, who lost their son 16-year-old Dustin in 2000 following a vehicular accident allegedly caused by an immigrant who entered the U.S. illegally. Mrs. Inman, who was also in the vehicle, was left permanently disabled because of her injuries.
• Don Rosenberg, whose 25-year-old son Drew Rosenberg died in 2010 following a vehicular accident allegedly caused by an individual who had entered the country illegally.
• Maureen Maloney, who lost her son 23-year-old son Matthew Denice following a vehicular accident in 2011 caused by a man who was driving drunk and had entered the U.S. illegally. The man who caused the accident was later sentenced to 12 years in prison.
• Maureen Laquerre, whose brother Richard Grossi died in 2009 following a vehicular accident allegedly caused by a previously deported migrant.
• Kimberly Roberts and Chris Stansberry, who lost their 18-year-old daughter Tierra, following a fire allegedly set by a migrant who entered the U.S. illegally.
• Ray Tranchant, who lost his daughter 16-year-old daughter Tessa in 2007 to a migrant who was driving drunk.

President Donald Trump on Friday put a spotlight on families who lost loved ones killed by undocumented immigrants — calling them victims of “permanent separation"" — as he sought to shift the attention away from his administration’s recently halted policy of separating migrant families at the border.
It was a dramatic way to end a week that saw Trump make a rare reversal in the face of public outcry, and presented a counterargument as mothers and fathers told grisly tales of their children being tortured and murdered — and claimed the media has not covered their stories.

“You know, you hear the other side. You never hear this side. You don't know what's going on. These are the American citizens permanently separated from their loved ones. The word permanently being the word that you have to think about,” the president said Friday afternoon.
“They're not separated for a day or two days. These were permanently separated because they were killed by illegal aliens. These are the families the media ignores. They don't talk about them. Very unfair.”
One by one, mothers and fathers took turns at the podium, invited by the president to share their stories. One mother recalled that her son had been repeatedly strangled and set on fire after he was dead. A father told the crowd of administration officials and law enforcement officers that his daughter had been kidnapped, raped and killed in 1990 and her body left naked in an artichoke field.

Another father, whose son was shot and killed while working as a clerk on an overnight shift, said his family sets up a Christmas tree on his son’s grave every year. Holding a challenge coin he had been given by acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan, the father said, “I wish some of our media had the same integrity as our president, our vice president.”
Trump mostly steered clear of directly addressing the family separation issue that sparked an international backlash, although some of the parents alluded to it in their remarks. The president’s comments were more somber than his Twitter outburst early Friday morning, in which he accused Democrats of telling “their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections.”
Several of the parents carried large photographs of their deceased sons and daughters, many of which appeared to have been autographed by the president.
“I was going to end my life. I had no purpose, but President Trump coming down that escalator that day and talking about illegal immigration stopped me in my tracks. And I had no clue at that point that I would ever be at the White House,” one mother, who wore the ashes of her son, killed by a drunk driver, in a locket around her neck. “Remember when you go home and hug your kids that there are many of us, thousands of us who don't get to do that anymore.”
The event marked the end of a week which the White House spent fully on the defensive, pushing back against a tidal wave of outcry over its policy of referring all illegal border-crossers for prosecution, a practice that resulted in the forcible separation of thousands of children from their parents.
Early in the week, the Trump administration held fast to its position that the administration’s hands were tied on family separation by established law, even though no such law exists and the policy was the result of a Justice Department policy directive that could be easily reversed.
The White House also argued that the practice could only be ended by a change in the law and therefore it was obstinate Democrats, unwilling to accede to the president’s broader immigration demands, who were to blame for the separations.
With both White House arguments proving untenable and public pressure mounting in the wake of photographs of children kept in cages at a Texas facility and audio of them crying out for their moms and dads, Trump signed an executive order Wednesday intended to keep families together at the border.
But even after the president’s order, confusion remained as to what would happen to the already separated families and how exactly families crossing the border illegally would be treated moving forward.
While administration spokespeople were steadfast in their positions, they quickly found themselves on an island, with Republicans on Capitol Hill growing increasingly vocal in their criticism of the practice.
The issue remained contentious Friday afternoon on Capitol Hill, where Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), played audio of children wailing inside a detention center on the House floor as Rep. Karen Handel (R-Ga.), who was presiding over the chamber at the time, tried to gavel him down, accusing him of violating House rules.
Throughout the week, administration officials complained often that the media’s coverage of illegal immigration and the issue of family separation neglected to reflect the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, a group Trump spotlighted frequently on the campaign trail. Friday’s event, portions of which were carried live by all three major cable news networks, seemed an effort at redirecting the media’s attention.
“I cannot imagine it being any worse, but we promise to act with strength and resolve,"" the president said. “We’ll not rest until our border is secure, our citizens are safe and we end this immigration crisis once and for all… Your loved ones have not died in vain.”"

AD
The president has been on the defensive this week because of his “zero-tolerance” enforcement policy that has led to at least 2,500 migrant children being separated from their parents. While Trump signed an executive order Wednesday ending the practice, he has bristled at the sympathy directed toward the migrant families and argued without evidence that many of them are criminals and intent on doing harm once in the United States.
AD
“We must maintain a Strong Southern Border,” Trump tweeted Friday morning. “We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections.”
The administration has struggled to implement the hastily drafted executive order, which was intended to end the controversy over family separations by stating that parents and children could be detained together. But the Homeland Security Department interpreted it as meaning they would no longer refer for prosecution the cases of adults illegally crossing the U.S. border with children because of to a lack of space at existing facilities for housing detained families. The Justice Department wanted the prosecutions to continue.
AD
Administration officials met late Thursday and on Friday to try to hash out these differences as well as to come up with a plan for reuniting the migrant families that have already been separated.
AD
At the White House event Friday, Trump and many of the family members who spoke criticized what they called one-sided media coverage that does not focus on their stories.
“We weren’t lucky enough to be separated for five days or 10 days; we’re separated permanently,” said Laura Wilkerson, whose son Josh was killed in 2010. “Any time we want to see or be close to our kids, we go to the cemetery, because that’s where they are. We could never speak to them, we can’t Skype with them.”
AD
The president blamed Democrats for what he called weak immigration laws and policies that treat those in the country illegally too leniently, even though Republicans control Congress and failed this week to pass an immigration bill out of the House because of opposition from GOP members. Trump railed against the MS-13 gang, heroin from outside the United States, and so-called “catch and release” immigration enforcement.
AD
Trump also said he does not believe research that shows undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than ­native-born citizens, but did not specify how he came to that conclusion.
“I always hear that, ‘Oh, no, the population’s safer than the people that live in the country,’ ” Trump said. “You’ve heard that, fellas, right? You’ve heard that. I hear it so much, and I say, ‘Is that possible?’ The answer is it’s not true. You hear it’s like they’re better people than what we have, than our citizens. It’s not true.”
AD
The president also falsely claimed that 63,000 Americans have been killed by illegal immigrants since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The number appears to come from a 2006 blog post from Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who advocates limiting immigration, that was based on conjecture, not statistical evidence.

Trump’s comments on immigration this week have roiled the debate in Congress, where House Republican leaders were attempting to pass legislation that could satisfy conservatives and moderates.
On Friday morning, Trump tweeted that Republicans should stop “wasting their time” on immigration, suggesting they put off efforts to pass legislation until after the November elections, when he predicted more GOP members of Congress will be elected.
AD
Trump’s comments came after Republican leaders in the House abruptly postponed a vote Thursday on a broad immigration bill intended to unite GOP moderates and conservatives, acknowledging they lacked the votes to pass the measure despite the growing uproar over separating migrant families at the border.
Trump’s tweet, GOP aides said, could make the task of corralling votes for the bill significantly more difficult, though House Republican leaders said negotiations would continue. The House defeated a bill supported by conservatives on Thursday.
AD
“Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November,” Trump wrote. “Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!”

Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said Trump was “expressing his frustration” at a lack of Democratic involvement on the issue and that efforts will continue to find enough votes to pass a bill. But Scalise acknowledged it would be “an uphill fight.”
“We’re going to move forward,” he said. “We’re going to have a vote. . . . It would be nice if you had at least one Democrat who was willing to vote for a bill that secures America’s border, and so far none have been willing to do that.”
Responding to Trump’s latest tweets, Democrats — who are optimistic they will pick up seats in both chambers of Congress in November — said it was Trump who is standing in the way of immigration reform and trying to create a political issue. They have expressed frustration that the Republican bills were crafted without their input.

The bill set to be voted on next week would provide $25 billion for Trump’s long-sought border wall, offer a pathway to citizenship to young undocumented immigrants known as “dreamers” and keep migrant families together in detention centers.
Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.), a member of the whip team in the House, said Trump could make a difference in passing legislation if he were more emphatic about what he wants.
“If the president said to a given bill, ‘That’s my bill, that’s the one I want,’ I think that would have a pretty significant impact on our discussions,” Byrne said. “But he hasn’t done that yet, and so we’re continuing to work without that.”
AD
Despite the GOP leadership’s vows to fight on, some Republicans were openly skeptical about their ability to achieve success in the wake of Trump’s latest tweets.
AD
“Game over,” Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) said during an interview on CNN. “It takes the wind out of the sails in what might have been a fairly productive week in terms of looking for compromise. I don’t know how it happens, because if you look at how contentious this issue is, how much emotion there is, without the president being out front — without the president having legislators’ backs — there’s no way they’re going to take the risks that would be inherent in a major reform bill.”
GOP aides noted the difficulties. The chances of a bill passing are “not good, and worse with the POTUS tweets,” said one aide, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the sensitive issue. Another said Trump would be to blame if legislation fails.
The president seemed unconcerned, having already turned his attention to November’s midterm elections.

6778,Trump urges Republican lawmakers to drop immigration effort',Reuters,6/22/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration/trump-urges-republican-lawmakers-to-drop-immigration-effort-idUSKBN1JI1CI,"SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lilian Merida-Galicia and her 7-year-old daughter were apprehended after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona and separated by U.S. officials in mid-May.
Since then, the 23-year-old Guatemalan has been trying to learn her daughter’s whereabouts, according to her attorney, Michael Avenatti. At one point she sent a note to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
“Please could you send me a phone number so that I can communicate with my daughter?” read the note, which was written in Spanish and seen by Reuters.
An ICE officer replied in a note in English: “I do not have this information.”
Merida-Galicia, who is being held in California, is just one of many incarcerated immigrant mothers whose attorneys tell similar stories about chaotic situations in which the mothers don’t know where their children have been taken or how to contact them. The mothers themselves could not be contacted because access to detained immigrants is difficult.
Although President Donald Trump abruptly reversed course on Wednesday following a wave of outrage at home and overseas and abandoned his policy of separating children from parents who are apprehended for illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, the fate of the more than 2,300 children already separated from their parents while Trump’s policy was still in force is unknown.
Avenatti, who has made headlines representing porn star Stormy Daniels in an unrelated lawsuit against Trump, said Merida-Galicia is among more than 60 immigrant parents he represents and 80 percent of them do not know where their children are.
The federal government and Congress scrambled on Friday to address the many unanswered questions raised by the hastily drafted executive order Trump issued on Wednesday.
Attorney Luis Cortes Romero in Kent, Washington, said he represents a Salvadoran woman who was separated in early May from her 11-year-old daughter with Down syndrome after the two crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas. The woman is being held in Washington state and has decided she doesn’t want to pursue asylum so that she can be deported and reunited with her daughter, he said.
“She said she never wants to come back, and that this experience has been so traumatizing,” Cortes Romero said.
Trump suggested on Friday that some of the wrenching tales that have emerged from the border were fabricated by Democrats.
“We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections,” he tweeted.
CONGRESS STUMBLES
Trump urged Republican lawmakers on Friday to drop their efforts to pass comprehensive immigration legislation until after the November congressional elections, flip-flopping on his appeal earlier in the week for Congress to act soon.
Trump has gone back and forth on ways to solve the country’s immigration problems, which he blames on Democrats.
“Elect more Republicans in November and we will pass the finest, fairest and most comprehensive Immigration Bills anywhere in the world,” Trump said on Twitter.

“Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!” he said.
All 435 House seats and a third of the 100-member Senate will be up for grabs in November. Democrats are hoping that discontent among voters with Trump’s policies, including on immigration, will help the party make gains in Congress and flip control to Democrats in at least one chamber.
The House of Representative on Thursday rejected a bill backed by conservatives that would have halted the practice of splitting up families and addressed other immigration issues. The House postponed until next week a vote on a more moderate bill after it failed to attract enough support for passage. But Trump’s latest tweets could doom that effort.
“Game over,” said Representative Mark Sanford, a Republican critic of Trump who came under withering attack from the president before losing his primary race this month.
“Without the president having legislators’ backs, there’s no way they’re going to take the risks that would be inherent in a major reform bill,” Sanford told CNN.
Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican who represents a majority Hispanic district in Florida and is not running for re-election, said Trump’s tweets amounted to “schizoid policy making.”
REUNIFICATION UNCLEAR
Even though the president has now ordered that families be kept together in detention during immigration proceedings, it remained unclear how and when those children already separated would be reunited with their parents, and where families would be held while the parents face criminal charges.
The U.S. Navy is drafting plans to house up to 25,000 immigrants on its bases and other facilities, at an estimated cost to taxpayers of about $233 million over six months, a U.S. official said on Friday.

But the Navy has not so far been asked to provide accommodation for migrants who have entered the United States illegally, and the official, who asked not to be named, stressed that the draft memo, which looks at setting up housing on Navy airfields in Alabama, was for planning purposes only.
The Department of Homeland Security on Friday filed a notice saying it may need up to 15,000 more beds to handle immigrant families. That would be a sharp increase from the 2,500 beds available for families in the last fiscal year.
Shares in private prison operators CoreCivic Inc and Geo Group rose on Friday as investors bet on increasing demand for their services after U.S. authorities asked about available capacity for the detention of immigrant families.
It was also unclear if the government would keep prosecuting cases against people caught crossing the border illegally. It was the administration’s policy of zero tolerance - announced in April - that led to blanket prosecutions, including of adults traveling with children."

USA TODAY
President Donald Trump, bowing to a deepening humanitarian crisis along the southwest border, signed an executive order Wednesday that promises to halt family separation while insisting that the administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy to prosecute all illegal immigrants would continue.
“We’re going to have strong, very strong borders, but we’re going to keep the families together,"" Trump said. ""I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated.""
Vice President Mike Pence and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen stood by his side when he signed the order in the Oval Office.
""Thank you for your leadership, sir,"" said Nielsen, who has become the public face of the administration's policy that led to separation of children from adult immigrants charged with illegal entry.
The order's title, ""Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation,"" puts the onus on lawmakers to provide a long-term fix with legislative action.
It authorizes DHS to keep families together when they are detained at the border, unless officials determine that the child's welfare is at ""risk."" It also authorizes the Defense Department to provide facilities for housing those families.
Also under the order, the Justice Department was directed to prioritize the prosecution of cases involving families.
Justice officials had been working since early Wednesday on a draft of the order aimed at reversing politically-charged policy that has resulted in the separation of more than 2,000 children of adult illegal immigrants in the past month, an official familiar with the matter said Wednesday.
The scope of the order, however, did not address how the already-separated children would be re-united with their parents.
The text of the document appeared only to apply to families of future illegal immigrants, while fates of the existing detainees — children and adults — are likely to be left to Congress to resolve.
The first signs that Trump was preparing to act emerged early Wednesday, as Nielsen huddled with the White House to discuss possible options, including an executive order, while Attorney General Jeff Sessions worked with Justice officials on the mechanics and language that would ultimately preserve the administration's promise to prosecute all those accused of illegal entry.

Hours later, Trump announced that he would take action to end family separation.
“I’ll be signing something in a little while that’s going to do that,"" Trump said after he was asked about stopping the separation of families at the border. ""I’ll be doing something that’s somewhat preemptive and ultimately will be matched by legislation, I’m sure.”
The controversial zero tolerance policy was first announced more than a month ago by Sessions.
“If you cross this border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you,” Sessions said in the shadow of California's busiest border crossing in San Diego. ""If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law.”
Some of the most intense public pressure to reverse course, had been applied to Nielsen, the public face of the strategy, and Sessions, the architect of the zero tolerance policy.
Late Tuesday, protesters heckled Nielsen as she ate dinner at a downtown Washington, D.C., Mexican restaurant. And for his part, Sessions was rebuked by separate coalitions of state attorneys general and former federal prosecutors who called on the attorney general to halt the practice of separating children from their parents.
Sessions also was the target of public condemnation from United Methodist clergy and lay members who suggested that that actions taken by the administration and the attorney general were akin to child abuse.
Still, prior to his announcement, Trump again blamed Democrats for the problems, asserting that Republicans wanted security.
""I am working on something - it never ends!"" he tweeted."
2943,Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Plan To Stop Family Separations Is To Detain Families Together',HuffPost,6/20/2018,,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-republicans-family-separations-plan_us_5b2a8b03e4b0a4dc992364e0,"President Donald Trump’s plan to stop his administration’s policy of separating immigrant children from their families seems simple: Lock up immigrant parents and their children together, indefinitely.
But there’s no evidence that Trump has the legal authority to make his wish reality. His plan, issued in an executive order on Wednesday, conflicts with a 2015 court ruling that required the government to release child migrants from detention after 20 days. Trump can’t dismiss federal judges’ rulings by decree. So his executive order will trigger a massive showdown between his administration and human rights activists in court.
“These are protections for kids. That’s the doctrine here,” said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute’s office at the NYU School of Law. “And if anything goes against the protection of kids, it will be challenged.”
Trump administration officials have insisted that they enacted the family separation policy in part because of a 2015 court order over a 1997 court settlement called the Flores agreement. The Flores agreement and the ensuing 2015 ruling limit the length of time that children can be detained, including with their parents. Most detained immigrant children must be released within about 20 days to continue their deportation proceedings outside of detention. In the past, the federal government has generally released the children’s mothers from family detention along with them rather than splitting them up.
The Trump administration has said this policy effectively creates “catch and release” for families, and proposed changing it through legislation. But getting immigration policy through Congress is an uphill battle.
Yuri Gripas / Reuters President Donald Trump unveiled an executive order on Wednesday to address his administration's policy of separating immigration children from their families. But the plan conflicts with a 2015 court ruling that required the government to release child migrants from detention after 20 days.
Trump said when he signed the order that a zero tolerance policy for illegal entry would continue, meaning the administration will still aggressively pursue prosecution of parents. Now, according to his order, parents being prosecuted will be locked up with their kids in most circumstances while criminal proceedings go forward ― and even after, while they pursue immigration cases. Those proceedings can take years.
The order conscripts the entirety of the federal government into mass immigrant family detention. It instructs heads of government agencies to make facilities available for family detention, to the extent permissible by law. The Department of Defense is instructed to also “construct such facilities if necessary.” The order says the Department of Homeland Security will reimburse these other agencies for the expense.
The policy isn’t a reversal of his border crackdown; it’s a continuation of it.
“I think the word compassion comes into it,” Trump said at the White House. “But it’s still equally as tough, if not tougher.”
Now, as the backlash against family separation at the border grows, Republicans in Congress are floating measures to spike the Flores agreement and its accompanying court orders, freeing up the Trump administration to keep families together by locking them up indefinitely in family detention centers. One proposal would reportedly divert some of the $7 billion originally marked for border security infrastructure to expand upon the three family detention centers that Immigration and Customs Enforcement currently runs.
If that legislation were to pass, it wouldn’t have an immediate impact, according to Peter Schey, one of lawyers who represents children in the ongoing class action lawsuit over the Flores Agreement.
Instead, the government would have to go to court to ask the judge to terminate the agreement, he said. If that happens, Schey and his team of lawyers will oppose. If they lose after a lengthy appeal process, they’ll turn around and file a similar lawsuit that could put the federal government in the exact same situation it was in before trying to kill the settlement through legislation.
“Even if they succeed in getting some legislation that’s onerous and inhumane, I wouldn’t be surprised if a year or two later we can get it set aside,” Schey said.
It’s hard to predict how the courts might rule. But the basic elements of the settlement ― that child migrants should be treated humanely and freed from detention if they don’t present a danger to the community or a flight risk ― are already part of U.S. immigration law. And U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee, who presides over the case, repeatedly hammered the Obama administration with harshly worded rulings in the years that it tried to expand family detention to deal with an influx of Central Americans seeking asylum.
Congress has wide latitude to change immigration laws, which could make a legal challenge more difficult, Chishti said. But Congress cannot pass laws that violate the Constitution, and there are concerns that long-term family detention could violate the rights of those detained.
A policy change made by Trump alone would be even more susceptible to litigation, Chishti said. Trump has already run into problems with his administrative actions on immigration, including his travel bans, attempt to eliminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for undocumented young people and efforts to punish so-called “sanctuary cities” for not fully cooperating with deportation efforts.
Trump said Wednesday that he thinks Congress would follow up his executive order with legislation, but that’s not a guarantee ― it’s unclear whether any of the legislative proposals put forward so far, some of which are vague, have enough support to pass.
Immigrant rights advocates argue that Trump and Congress should pursue alternatives to family detention, which would allow kids and parents to be together and monitored by immigration officials during their removal proceedings, just not locked up.
“The two cornerstones of the settlement don’t seem to be very controversial,” Schey said. “It’s been hard to see how Congress might say, ‘No ― we want to treat these children inhumanely.’ Or ‘No, we want to detain these kids even if they have a viable sponsor and they’re not a threat to others.’ If that’s not true, what’s the justification for insisting on their detention?”
Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House immigration subcommittee, predicted on Wednesday that if Trump tried to violate the Flores agreement, the action would wind up blocked by a judge.
“The Flores settlement is in place for a reason, which is that indefinite incarceration of children in prisons is not a good thing for them and not necessary, whether it’s by themselves or with their parents,” she told HuffPost. “To repeal that is not consistent with American values.”"
4884,Trump signs executive order stopping family separation',Washington Times,6/20/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jun/20/trump-says-sign-something-stop-family-separation/,"President Trump signed an order Wednesday ending the separation of families at the border, moving to end a crisis that engulfed his administration and threatened to derail his hopes of progress on broader immigration reforms.
The changes don’t end the new zero-tolerance policy that pushes for criminal prosecutions of illegal immigrants who jump the border — indeed, it enshrines the policy in the executive order.
But it does mean those families arrested for sneaking in will be held in immigration detention facilities, rather than separated, with parents sent to criminal justice system jails and kids handed off to Health Department-run dorms.
“What we have done today is we are keeping families together. The borders are just as tough, just as strong,” Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office as he signed the order, flanked by Vice President Mike Pence and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.
It’s not clear what the order means for the more than 2,300 children who were already separated. The government has been unable to say how many of them were already reunited, and couldn’t say Wednesday what will happen now in those cases.
And much of the success of the order depends on being able to hold families in detention longer than 20 days — which will require overturning a 2015 court case that imposed the 20-day limit. Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ask the court to revise its ruling, and he urged Congress to step in and pass legislation to solve the matter once and for all.
“This is a stopgap measure. The president’s doing everything he can here within the bounds of existing authority,” said Gene Hamilton, a senior aide to Mr. Sessions.
But immigrant-rights groups were furious, saying that while they didn’t want children separated from families, neither did they want families to be detained.
“Family incarceration is not the answer to ending family separation, and moving children from one cage to another is an outrage,” said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a leading liberal think tank.
Indeed, Mr. Trump’s decision Wednesday seemed to rip the bandaid off the immigration fight, exposing the scabs of years of stalemate.
On one side was the administration and many Republicans, who argued that people who come to the country illegally should be quickly deported, and the only way to ensure that is to hold them in detention, which makes sure they show up for their hearings.
Opposing Mr. Trump are Democrats and immigrant-rights groups that argue many of the illegal immigrants should be treated as refugees, should not be held in detention, and should be given government-funded lawyers to help them argue their cases for why they should be allowed to stay.
Signing the order marked a major retreat for the president, who for the last week had blamed Democrats for the separations and said it would take a change in law to stop it.
On Wednesday, Mr. Trump talked about the “dilemma” he felt he was facing.
“The dilemma is that if you’re weak — like some people would like you to be — if you’re really, really pathetically weak, the country’s going to be overrun with millions of people,” Mr. Trump said. “And if you’re strong, then you don’t have any heart. That’s a tough dilemma. Perhaps I’d rather be strong, but that’s a tough dilemma.”
The crux of the zero-tolerance policy is using the criminal code to try to deter illegal immigration. For decades, it’s been a crime to jump the border — though past administrations used those provisions only sparingly.
The Trump administration has said it wants nearly 100 percent prosecutions.
Currently those charged with crimes are supposed to be held by the Justice Department, whose jails are not equipped for family custody. Homeland Security does have some family detention facilities, but they are used for people in the immigration system, not the criminal justice system.
House Republicans’ new immigration bill, expected to be voted on Thursday, includes a provision that would write into law the ability for the government to keep migrants in criminal proceedings in Homeland Security facilities.
The House bill would only apply to parents charged with misdemeanors. Those with felony charges, such as smuggling or reentering the country after a previous deportation, would still go to the Justice Department under the House plan.
Keeping families together in Homeland Security detention will likely require an infusion of cash to create more family detention space.
Mr. Trump ordered the Defense Department and other federal agencies to offer whatever space they could.
The Obama administration, which faced its own surge of illegal immigrant families in 2014 and 2015, tried to open family detention centers but was met with fierce opposition by immigrant-rights advocates who said it was cruel to keep families detained.
They renewed those objections Wednesday.
“Even if families are detained together, it is just as harmful as family separation,” said America’s Voice, a leading advocacy group, citing psychologists.
The number of families surging toward the U.S. has increased dramatically this year. Activist groups say they’re fleeing horrific conditions back home, while Mr. Trump says they’re being enticed to the U.S. by “loopholes” and other lax policies, realizing that if they can show up with children they’ll be quickly released and can disappear into the shadows with the 11 million other illegal immigrants already here.
That spurred the zero-tolerance policy, which kicked in fully in early May.
Homeland Security officials said that from May 5 through June 9 they arrested 4,538 people who snuck into the U.S. traveling as families and who faced separation. That included 2,206 adults who were prosecuted and sent to jail to await their proceedings, leaving 2,342 juveniles as Unaccompanied Alien Children who had to be stuck in government-run dorms.
Usually the adults serve a few days in jail, plead guilty to illegal entry charges, are sentenced to the time they already served, and are released back into the immigration system.
Senate Republicans on Wednesday introduced a bill that would try to permanently stop family separations by allowing them to be kept together in Homeland Security facilities for a longer period of time. The legislation would set mandatory conditions for the family detention centers, and it would also try to shorten the time immigration cases take by adding more judges and giving priority to these cases.
The GOP bill, combined with Mr. Trump’s move, puts the focus back on Democrats.
They were conflicted.
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said Mr. Trump made the right move — and said he hoped the administration would move quickly to reunite the more than 2,000 children already taken from parents.
But his top lieutenant, Sen. Dick Durbin, blasted Mr. Trump and demanded he end detention altogether for the families in question.
“Locking up whole families is no solution at all — the Trump administration must reverse its policy of prosecuting vulnerable people fleeing three of the most dangerous countries on earth, who are attempting to seek safe haven in America,” the Illinois Democrat said.

4240,"Trump blesses House Republicans' new compromise immigration bill""",Washington Times,6/20/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jun/19/donald-trump-blesses-house-republicans-immigration/,"President Trump blessed House Republicans’ compromise immigration bill “1,000 percent” Tuesday, giving political cover to conservatives looking to back the bill and creating momentum ahead of a showdown vote expected this week.
He said the legislation, which grants citizenship rights to illegal immigrant “Dreamers,” funds his border wall, limits the chain of family migration and ends the visa lottery, checks off all the boxes on his immediate immigration wish list.
Meeting with Republicans for an hour Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump told them he would welcome a fix to the family separation issue that has engulfed the immigration debate this week. But he made clear that any action would have to come from Congress, not from the administration.
His blessing clears up the mess he left Friday when he said he wouldn’t sign the bill. The White House later said he misunderstood the question, but his wavering left a number of conservatives fearful of voting for the bill only to have the president walk away from the legislation, leaving them on a political ledge.
“He says, ‘I am behind you 1,000 percent and I am not going to leave you out to dry,’ ” said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Washington Republican and chairwoman of the House Republican Conference.
Whether that is good enough to win the votes of 218 Republicans — the number needed to approve the bill — is unclear.
“It’s going to be close,” said Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican who helped craft the compromise bill. “This is a very challenging issue, very controversial. All members are going to have to take some risks to make this happen.”
Rep. Mark Meadows, North Carolina Republican and head of the Freedom Caucus, said he is still weighing his vote, but the bill is a no-go for other conservatives.
“I think there are some who believe that it is amnesty, and they don’t want to vote for amnesty,” he said.
He also said some on the liberal side of the party wanted a more generous legalization for Dreamers.
“We represent very different districts,” he said. “The thing that motivates me to stay involved is I think the moderates negotiated in good faith — whether we get to 218 or not, I don’t know.”
Republican leaders released the official version of the bill Tuesday evening while Mr. Trump was meeting with them.
The bill would grant full legal status and a path to citizenship to people who qualify for the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. The bill also would end the visa lottery and limit the types of family members who can be sponsored for immigration. It takes those visas and uses them for the DACA population and other children brought to the U.S. illegally as minors by their parents.
In terms of enforcement, the bill allows the Department of Homeland Security to detain more people and deport them faster, and it increases the threshold for people attempting to claim asylum, with a goal of reducing fraudulent claims that have clogged the system.
Republican leaders tucked in a fix for the family separation issue, allowing the government to hold children and their parents in immigration detention facilities for longer than 20 days. The bill also says that illegal immigrant parents charged with misdemeanors, who normally would be sent to the criminal justice system’s jails, can be held in immigration detention — meaning they can remain with their children.
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, told The Washington Times that Mr. Trump got a good reception from the party.
“It was great,” he said.
Outside the meeting, a group of Democrats marched along the corridors holding signs that said, “Families Belong Together,” and that depicted some of the now-iconic photos of children and their parents at the border.
As the president walked through one of the Capitol’s corridors, a heckler shouted at him, “Mr. President, F– you!” An NBC reporter said on Twitter that the culprit was a congressional intern.
Earlier Tuesday, some of the president’s key supporters warned him against embracing the bill.
The National ICE Council, the union that represents officers at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said the bill falls short on a number of the president’s campaign promises.
Chris Crane, the council president, wrote a letter to Mr. Trump saying the bill would open the door to massive fraud, would allow people who defy judges’ deportation orders to get on a pathway to citizenship and would fail to make good on Mr. Trump’s promise of a deportation force of 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.
He labeled the bill the “Ryan amnesty” and said it repeats the mistakes of the failed 2013 “Gang of 8” immigration bill.
“You pledged publicly to ‘have the backs’ of the men and women of ICE law enforcement. I am asking you to keep that promise,” Mr. Crane wrote.
The ICE Council endorsed Mr. Trump on the campaign trail in 2016.
Rep. Bob Goodlatte, Virginia Republican, said he is “sympathetic to their concerns” but that the compromise is better than alternative proposals that they would have hated.
“But we really have to do something that can get to 218 votes, and some of the people who are in that negotiation did not support their request,” Mr. Goodlatte said. “This happened very quickly, and if they don’t think they were consulted enough, I understand that.”
The White House did not respond to questions about the letter.
Republican leaders plan two votes this week.
One would be on an enforcement-heavy bill written months ago by Mr. Goodlatte and Rep. Michael T. McCaul, Texas Republican. Both chair key committees. That bill includes a renewable DACA permit but doesn’t give Dreamers a pathway to citizenship. It does include a host of new enforcement measures such as requiring employers to use E-Verify to check their hires, cracking down on sanctuary cities and making it a misdemeanor to overstay a visa.
Those measures went too far for many Republicans, and the Goodlatte bill struggled to reach 218 supporters.
So Republican leaders pushed Mr. Goodlatte, Mr. McCaul and moderate lawmakers to work on the compromise bill.
Mr. Trump had backed the enforcement-heavy bill, but his full-throated support for the compromise was critical.
“Folks that would have been against it, I think it’s harder for them to be against it now,” said Rep. Bill Flores, Texas Republican. “I think he probably changed a lot of minds.”

2906,Trump says would back both House immigration bills as separation crisis grows',Reuters,6/20/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration/trump-says-would-back-both-house-immigration-bills-as-separation-crisis-grows-idUSKBN1JF177,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump told Republican lawmakers on Tuesday he would back either of the immigration bills making their way through the House of Representatives, as the outcry grew over his administration’s separation of immigrant parents and children at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Representative Mark Meadows said Trump told Republican members of the House at a meeting on Capitol Hill that they needed to get something done on immigration “right away.”
In the meeting, Trump said separating families was “certainly not an attractive thing and does look bad,” added Representative Tom Cole.
Congressional Republicans have been scrambling to craft legislation as videos of youngsters in cages and an audiotape of wailing children have sparked anger at home from groups ranging from clergy to influential business leaders, as well as condemnation abroad.
A Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll released on Tuesday showed fewer than one in three American adults supporting the policy. The June 16-19 poll found that 28 percent of people polled supported the policy, while 57 percent opposed it and the remaining 15 percent said they did not know.
Trump, who has made a tough stance on immigration a centerpiece of his presidency, has staunchly defended his administration’s actions. He has cast blame for the family separations on Democrats, although his fellow Republicans control both chambers in Congress and his own administration implemented the current policy of strict adherence to immigration laws.
The president has sought to link an end to the family separations to passage of a wider bill on immigration, which would include funding for his long-sought border wall with Mexico, prompting Democrats to accuse him of using children as hostages.
“In his remarks, he endorsed both House immigration bills that build the wall, close legal loopholes, cancel the visa lottery, curb chain migration, and solve the border crisis and family separation issue by allowing for family detention and removal,” White House spokesman Raj Shah said of Trump.
An unidentified person yelled an obscenity at the president before he entered the meeting.
Earlier on Tuesday, the president tried again to blame Democrats for what he called “loopholes” in the law that require families detained for entering the country illegally either to be separated or released.
“These are crippling loopholes that cause family separation, which we don’t want,” he said in remarks to the National Federation of Independent Business, adding he wanted Congress to give him the legal authority to detain and deport families together.
BILL WOULD PREVENT SOME SEPARATIONS
House Republicans were working on a revised draft of one version of an immigration overhaul that would prevent family separations in some cases for those attempting an illegal border crossing for the first time, according to a House Republican aide.
The draft bill was seen just days ago as unlikely to pass, but has gained support in the House, and it was unclear whether the new language about preventing family separations would improve its chances for passage.
Both Republican bills under discussion, which have been blasted by Democrats and immigration advocacy groups, would fund the border wall and reduce legal migration, in part by denying visas for some relatives of U.S. residents and citizens who are living abroad, sometimes referred to as “chain migration.”
The more conservative bill from Representative Bob Goodlatte would also deny “Dreamers,” immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children, the chance of future citizenship.
Several hundred protesters marched in New York City, chanting “Keep families together!”
Anne Heaney, 74, a retired teacher, held a sign that read, “Children do not belong in cages. Maybe Trump and Pence do.”
In Washington, activists stood next to a table occupied by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjien Nielsen in a Mexican restaurant, voicing criticism of the administration’s policy, according to video obtained by Reuters.
Two top U.S. business groups, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, decried the separation policy on Tuesday and called for its immediate cessation.

“My heart goes out to the impacted families,” said JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who chairs the Business Roundtable, in a memo to the bank’s employees. “Fixing these issues will clearly boost the economy,” he added.
Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook described the separation of children from parents at the U.S.-Mexico border as “inhumane” and promised to be a “constructive voice” in seeking to end the issue, the Irish Times newspaper reported.
Microsoft Corp CEO Satya Nadella called the policy cruel and abusive in an email to employees that was posted on Linkedin.com. He also said the company is not working on any projects with the U.S. government related to separating children from their families at the border.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection said on Tuesday that 2,342 children had been separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border between May 5 and June 9.
The separations began after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in April that all immigrants apprehended while crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally should be criminally prosecuted.
Parents who are referred by border agents for prosecution are held in federal jails, while their children are moved into border shelter facilities under the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a Department of Health and Human Services agency.
LEGISLATIVE POSSIBILITIES
A number of Republican senators called on Trump on Tuesday to allow families to stay together if they had crossed the border illegally, and Senate leaders said their chamber could have legislation to address the family separations matter in a matter of days.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said: “We hope to reach out to the Democrats and see if we can get a result, which means making a law and not just get into some kind of sparring back and forth that leads to no conclusion,” he said.
Top Democrats contended that Trump could change the policy with the stroke of a pen.
“The president is trying set this trap in the public mind that somehow there is a law requiring him to do this and Congress can undo it,” said Senator Chris Van Hollen, who visited a detention center in Brownsville, Texas, over the weekend. “We know this is a problem that was manufactured six weeks ago, and we’re seeing the awful results today.”

With the sound of a young child crying in the background, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler, broke from traditional protocol and started reading from a statement, saying: “These children are not animals.” His Republican colleagues tried to shout over him: “Out of order!”"

Donald Trump has told Republicans he is “1,000%” behind their immigration reform effort, but did not offer a clear path forward as his administration faced bipartisan condemnation over separating children and their parents at the border.

Meanwhile, it emerged that Trump administration officials have been sending babies and young children forcibly taken from their parents at the US-Mexico border to at least three “tender age” shelters in south Texas.
Lawyers and medical providers who have visited the Rio Grande valley shelters described playrooms full of crying preschool children.
Kay Bellor, the vice-president for programs at the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said: “The thought that they are going to be putting such little kids in an institutional setting? I mean, it is hard for me to even wrap my mind around it. Toddlers are being detained.”
Steven Wagner, an official with the Department of Health and Human Services, said: “We have specialised facilities that are devoted to providing care to children with special needs, and tender age children, as we define as under 13, would fall into that category.
“They’re not government facilities per se, and they have very well-trained clinicians, and those facilities meet state licensing standards for child welfare agencies, and they’re staffed by people who know how to deal with the needs particularly of the younger children.”
At a closed-door meeting with House Republicans on Capitol Hill, members said Trump expressed concern for the families being separated by the “zero-tolerance” policy, but he did not take responsibility for the practice. Instead, the president urged the Republicans in the room to pass legislation that keeps families together.
After the meeting, the Florida Republican congressman Carlos Curbelo said: “The president does want this to end.”
Curbelo, who has led the charge for immigration reform, said Trump told members that Ivanka Trump had appealed to him to stop separating families. However, the president gave no indication that he was willing to reverse the policy and did not acknowledge that he could stop the separations without legislation, he added. Instead, Trump insisted Congress deliver a legislative solution.
Unbowed by mounting public anger, Trump and leading administration officials have fiercely defended the policy, which has led to the separation of more than 2,300 children from their parents in five weeks.
Before the meeting on Tuesday evening, as the president walked through the Capitol, a protester yelled: “Mr President, fuck you.”
As Trump left the session, he faced a rare demonstration by members of Congress. House Democrats shouted at the president to abandon his immigration policy while waving signs that read: “Families belong together.”

The California congressman Juan Vargas shouted: “Mr President, don’t you have kids? Don’t you have kids, Mr President? How would you like it if they separated your kids?”
Speaking to reporters, Trump said: “We had a great meeting. These are laws that have been broken for many years, decades. But we had a great meeting.”
Quick guide Why are families being separated at US border? Show Hide Why are children being separated from their families? In April 2018, the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, announced a “zero tolerance” policy under which anyone who crossed the border without legal status would be prosecuted by the justice department. This includes some, but not all, asylum seekers. Because children can’t be held in adult detention facilities, they are being separated from their parents. Immigrant advocacy groups, however, say hundreds of families have been separated since at least July 2017. More than 200 child welfare groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the United Nations, said they opposed the practice. What happens to the children? They are supposed to enter the system for processing “unaccompanied alien children”, which exists primarily to serve children who voluntarily arrive at the border on their own. Unaccompanied alien children are placed in health department custody within 72 hours of being apprehended by border agents. They then wait in shelters for weeks or months at a time as the government searches for parents, relatives or family friends to place them with in the US. This already overstretched system has been thrown into chaos by the new influx of children. Can these children be reunited with their parents? Immigration advocacy groups and attorneys have warned that there is not a clear system in place to reunite families. In one case, attorneys in Texas said they had been given a phone number to help parents locate their children, but it ended up being the number for an immigration enforcement tip line. Advocates for children have said they do not know how to find parents, who are more likely to have important information about why the family is fleeing its home country. And if, for instance, a parent is deported, there is no clear way for them to ensure their child is deported with them. What happened to families before? When an influx of families and unaccompanied children fleeing Central America arrived at the border in 2014, Barack Obama’s administration detained families. This was harshly criticized and a federal court in 2015 stopped the government from holding families for months without explanation. Instead, they were released while they waited for their immigration cases to be heard in court. Not everyone shows up for those court dates, leading the Trump administration to condemn what it calls a “catch and release” program. By Amanda Holpuch Read more
House Republicans, barrelling towards a vote on a pair of immigration bills, were hoping the president would rally skeptical members of the caucus around a proposal that sought common ground between moderates and conservatives on an issue that has fiercely divided the party.
Instead, Trump said he would sign either proposal that came to his desk, members said.
The Kansas Republican congressman Kevin Yoder said: “He said we need to pass one of the two bills.” He added that the president was “agnostic” about which of the two measures they should pass.
The Florida Republican congressman Mario Díaz-Balart said: “Here’s what I’m absolutely – 1,000% – sure of. “Without his [Trump’s] support, without his approvals, there’s no shot of it passing the House, there’s no shot of it going anywhere.”
During his remarks, which were expected to focus on immigration, Trump spoke about his recent visit to North Korea and his trade policy, members said. He also openly mocked the Republican congressman Mark Sanford, a conservative critic of the president who lost a primary this month after Trump endorsed his opponent, they said.

The meeting came at a delicate moment for Republicans, as several lawmakers in both chambers rushed to defuse the spiralling political crisis caused by the immigration crackdown.
Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said “all of the members of the Republican conference support a plan that keeps families together” and endorsed a narrow plan that would allow law enforcement to detain parents and children together while their immigration case is adjudicated in court. McConnell said he hoped to pass a bill as early as this week.

Any such legislation would require some support from Democrats, who immediately rebuffed the plan, arguing that Trump could unilaterally end the practice.
The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said: “There is no need for legislation. There’s no need for anything else. You [Trump] started it, you can stop it – plain and simple.”
Under the policy, all adults are arrested for crossing the border illegally. As children cannot be kept in an adult prison, they are held separately.
In the House, Republicans have included a provision to end family separations in their compromise immigration proposal, which would also provide $25bn (£19bn) for Trump’s border wall and his other hardline security demands. The bill would offer a pathway to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers. A rival bill, supported by a conservative bloc of Republicans, would not guarantee them a path to citizenship.
Trump did not discuss whether he would back a standalone measure should support for the immigration proposals flounder. The president has called on Democrats to negotiate an end to the separations, inviting criticism that he is leveraging the crisis at the border to win support for his hardline immigration framework.
The House is expected to vote on the immigration measures this week and their fates are far from certain.

Politico reported Tuesday that Trump is uninterested in the Senate’s plan to provide $1.6 billion on Trump’s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Instead, according to the news outlet, he wants the full $25 billion for the project funded all at once.
Trump told meeting attendees on Monday that he will shut down the government in September if he does not receive the full funding, Politico reported.

The government last shut down for three days in January as a temporary spending bill stalled in Congress.
Trump's hard-line stance over his border wall comes as his administration faces overwhelming opposition from Republicans and Democrats to its ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy, which has led to the separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents.
Trump has refused to cave on the policy, blaming Democrats for it. Other administration officials have said it falls on Congress to address the issue, despite the Trump administration implementing the zero tolerance policy.
The House is expected to vote soon on a pair of GOP immigration bills that include broader reforms. Meanwhile, some members of Congress have crafted legislation that would specifically end the practice of family separation."

President Donald Trump is getting frustrated with his administration’s own demands for border wall funding.

“He’s focused on border security. And like all presidents, he wants it done now. But we’re part of the legislative process. It’s slower and deliberate,"" said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), who met with Trump.
The president said at the meeting that if Congress doesn’t give him the resources he needs for border security, he will shut down the government in September, according to one of the people familiar with the meeting. He did not give a specific number, but has been fixated on getting the $25 billion in a lump sum.
In fact, the $1.6 billion figure came from Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, who attended the meeting. Mulvaney submitted the request to Congress earlier this year, though the administration has since upped its ask to $2.2 billion.
Senate Democrats offered to provide $25 billion in border wall funding earlier this year in return for giving 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship. But Trump and most Republicans rebuffed that proposal to salvage the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Democrats are unlikely to provide $25 billion for Trump's wall absent a much broader immigration deal.
Trump's renewed focus on the border wall comes amid rising pressure to end his administration's policy of separating families that cross the border illegally. The “zero tolerance” policy shift has been roundly criticized by lawmakers in both parties, but Trump has blamed Congress for inaction on immigration.
""Now is the best opportunity ever for Congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration. Get it done, always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security,"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning.
GOP lawmakers are loath to see a government shutdown on their watch just weeks before the midterm elections.
“It’s probably an overwhelming belief in the House and the Senate, especially the Senate, that government shutdowns aren’t good for anybody,"" Shelby said.
The Appropriations Committee began working to pass its Homeland Security bill on Tuesday. Democrats seem unlikely to change course and agree to add more border security money for the president.
""We've got the bill and we're moving forward and I think we're going to get good bipartisan support for it. I think it's a good bill that will keep our borders safe,"" said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), ranking member of the Homeland Security appropriations committee.
On Monday, GOP Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Shelby both tried to explain to Trump that the Senate is merely meeting Mulvaney’s request and has to cut a bipartisan deal with Democrats. The Senate needs 60 votes to pass a spending bill, so Republicans would have to find at least nine Democratic votes.
""We're going to make a down payment on that working together,"" said Capito, chairwoman of Homeland Security spending panel.
But Trump has not been mollified. He raised his voice several times in Monday's meeting with Mulvaney, White House staffers and the senators, insisting he needs the full $25 billion — an unlikely outcome in the narrowly divided Senate.
Shelby said he views $1.6 billion as a floor in negotiations, which could increase if Democrats want to do some horse-trading."

Is that bad for the GOP? Oh yeah—but let’s not forget that the Trump agenda benefits the GOP, but also his core group of voters who aren’t all Republicans. Trump was able to navigate a checkered path with his base, building off of GOP voters—90 percent of whom voted for him in 2016—and millions of Democrats and Independents who liked his attitude. He was change. He was different. And Hillary looked like the same old movie, only that it would yield more economic pain. A lot of Obama voters flipped for Trump; you don’t bury Clinton the way Trump did in Ohio without help from the other side of the aisle. If Trump is seen as bashing both parties to check off another action item from his agenda, he will be rewarded.
This is an easy item to understand. It’s funding for a wall, a wall that has been unable to be scaled by U.S. Special Forces. Obamacare was a tricky task. There are market factors to contend with, the IRS code due to the new taxes, the regulations, etc. it was a mess. And after nearly a decade of campaigning for its repeal, the GOP failed. There are no such strings attached with a wall. In politics, if you promise a simple thing like building a wall and fail, then you need to do something else. Trump is not like that. He’ll find a way to win.
Trump’s go-to shouldn’t be to put his party, most of which agree with most of his agenda items, in a terrible position so close to the midterms. Trump wants more GOP members elected, but that doesn’t mean Trump won’t do this. He will.
The immigration issue is one the splits the GOP, Democrats know this, which leads us to this discharge petition nonsense. It would have allowed the Left to hold immigration votes without the blessing of the House GOP leadership if they found 218 signatories. This effort was three votes shy, so we’re going to have a vote on two bills that probably won’t pass this week. Who got Democrats so close to success on this push? Well, that would be moderate Republicans."

Trump has repeatedly defended his immigration crackdown, including forcibly separating migrant children from their parents as they arrive at the border. But images of young children housed in metal cages have set off a nationwide outcry that has reached the White House.

Trump described for Republicans how his daughter Ivanka, a senior White House adviser, told him that the images from the border of families being separated were terrible, according to multiple GOP lawmakers who attended the session.
“Can we do anything to stop this?” Trump quoted her saying, according to one lawmaker.
The president’s reaction to his daughter’s remarks, the lawmaker said, was to call it a “tough issue” and push Congress to act: “We need to figure this out,” Trump said. “It’s a sad situation.”
AD
Despite the president’s visit, there was no guarantee that the Republican-led Congress would pass any legislation on immigration, an issue that has exposed deep rifts in the GOP and threatens the party’s control of Congress in November’s midterm elections.
On Wednesday morning, Trump tried again to pin blame on Democrats, writing on Twitter that the country’s immigration laws are “the weakest and worst anywhere in the world, and the Dems will do anything not to change them.”
AD
In another tweet, Trump said he was “working on something” but provided no details.

The images from the border have deeply shaken both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, even as Republicans have broadly agreed with the administration’s insistence that Congress hand Trump a legislative fix.
AD
Outside the meeting room, a handful of House Democrats heckled the president as he left the session. The group chanted “Stop separating the children” and “We won’t go away” — although Trump appeared to ignore the protests.
“Quit separating the children, Mr. President,” shouted Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.). “Don’t you have kids? Don’t you have kids?”
Trump and top administration officials are unwilling — at the moment, at least — to unilaterally reverse the separation policy.
The issue has roiled Republicans in the Senate, where lawmakers are drafting narrow legislation to address the issue. GOP senators are coalescing around a framework that would allow families to be detained together and would rework the docket of immigration cases so those families are sent to the front of the line of migrants waiting for a court hearing.

“All of the members of the Republican conference support a plan that keeps families together while their immigration status is determined,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) after a GOP meeting earlier in the day.
McConnell said he hoped the Senate could pass such a bill by the end of the week, although that timeline appeared optimistic.
In the House, there are two rival bills. One is a compromise measure that would provide $25 billion for Trump’s long-sought border wall, offer a pathway to citizenship to young undocumented immigrants and keep migrant families together.
A competing, hard-line bill by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) would not guarantee “dreamers” a path to permanent legal residency and includes controversial enforcement measures such as the mandatory use of a worker verification program.
AD
AD
Adding to the confusion on Capitol Hill, some House Republicans left the evening meeting with the impression that Trump was endorsing the compromise bill.
“The president gave unwavering support of the compromise bill,” said Rep. Jeff Denham ­(R-Calif.). Several other lawmakers said Trump told Republicans that he was “1,000 percent behind you.”
Yet when Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) asked Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) in front of reporters whether he knew which bill Trump was promoting at the meeting — the compromise or the hard-line measure — Sensenbrenner said he did not.
Inside the room, Trump acknowledged that the politics on the border issue were not good and were one reason Republicans needed to act on legislation this week, according to Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.).
AD
“There’s a storm brewing off the coast here, and if we don’t handle this in the next four or five days, this could stick all the way through November,” said Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee. “It’s not a political issue. It’s what’s right and what’s wrong.”
AD
Republicans are eager to find a legislative end to the turmoil sparked by the new “zero tolerance” policy at the border — although Trump in recent days has hinted that only a broader bill that included the border wall and other enforcement measures would pass muster.
The Department of Homeland Security has said 2,342 children have been separated from their parents since last month.
AD
As the numbers have mounted, stories of parents in despair and images of children held in chain-link cages have prompted a stream of Republican lawmakers to break with the president and call for him to unilaterally halt the policy while Congress pursues a solution.
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah), along with 12 other Senate Republicans, wrote to the Justice Department calling for a pause on separations until Congress can pass a legislative fix.
AD
In the House, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a prominent conservative leader, introduced another stand-alone bill intended to fix the separation policy.
While Republicans scrambled to craft legislation, it was not clear whether Democrats would support the measures. Sen. Jeff Merkley (Ore.) said Tuesday that he and other Democrats would object to any modification of an existing court settlement that limits the detention of migrant children held by federal authorities.
AD
Democrats, Merkley said, “are not going to try to overturn a court decision that was designed to protect kids.”
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has presented her own plan that would halt family separations. All 49 members of the Senate Democratic Caucus support it. No Republicans have signed on.
The immigration debate has now become consumed by the consequences of the Trump administration’s border policy.
AD
Top GOP leaders have spoken out against the separations, including the head of the party’s national House campaign organization. Polls released Monday by CNN and Quinnipiac University showed that Americans oppose the policy by roughly 2 to 1.
More legal challenges to the administration’s policy arose Tuesday, as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said his state would sue the Trump administration over the family separation practice. The American Civil Liberties Union is already pursuing a nationwide class-action lawsuit in San Diego.
Meanwhile, a second Republican governor, Larry Hogan of Maryland, announced Tuesday that he would not deploy National Guard resources to the border until the Trump administration stops separating migrant children from their parents as part of its criminal prosecution efforts. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) acted similarly Monday.
AD
Two previous presidents — a Republican and a Democrat — operated under the same laws and court settlements, and both generally refrained from separating families at the border. Some Trump administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, have openly cast the separation policy as a deterrent to future illegal immigration.
The two bills set for a House vote this week would both address the status of dreamers, as well as provide funding for the border wall that Trump has long demanded.
Both bills would require the Department of Homeland Security to keep families together, even when a parent is charged with the misdemeanor crime of illegally entering the United States, and would remove a 20-day cap on custody for accompanied children. The bills would also allow DHS to use the $7 billion appropriated in the measures for border technology to house families.
The two bills differ in several ways, however. One takes a more aggressive approach to immigration enforcement — for instance, requiring employers to screen their workers for legal work status using the federal E-Verify database — and does not guarantee dreamers a path to permanent legal residency. The other, which has been written to garner more Republican votes, omits some of the hard-line measures and offers dreamers a path to permanent residency and eventual citizenship."

At a White House briefing on Monday afternoon, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders introduced Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to speak to reporters about the issue.
Neilsen called on Congress to close the ""loopholes"" in the current law which prevent families from staying together. ""It is not possible, as a matter of law, to detain and remove whole family units who arrive illegally in the United States,"" Nielsen said.
In the tense briefing, Nielsen noted that the US has struggled with a huge spike in immigration at the Mexico border in the last three months. She also says most of the children in these facitlities were sent to the US alone, or with strangers.
""We give them medical care. We take care of them. We have high standards,"" Nielsen said.
When asked how President Donald Trump's evangelical supporters should respond to the immigration crisis, Sanders said any evangelical Christian or church who feels strongly about the issue should ""open up their doors and help facilitate some of these individuals.""
""That's their calling. It's the mission of the church, and they should certainly fulfill that,"" she added. ""If they want to fix the immigration problem, they should call their members of Congress and ask them to join with us to do that.""

First lady Melania Trump also weighed in on the controversy.
""Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,"" said Stephanie Grisham, press secretary and communications director for the first lady.
""She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws but also a country that governs with heart,"" she explained.
The Trump administration has long vowed to crack down on the rate of illegal immigration.
Now, the Department of Justice is pushing back with its new ""zero tolerance policy.""
""If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said.
Under the new policy, every adult that crosses into the US illegally will be criminally prosecuted. That includes asylum seekers who don't enter through the port of entry. With a criminal prosecution, children are then separated from their parents.
According to the Department of Homeland Security, 1,995 have been children separated from their parents in the past six weeks.
'A Life-Changing Experience'
Church elder and father of four Adam Estle has seen the influx of illegal immigrants up close and personal. Estle was the former director of Refugio Phoenix, a school for immigrant children.
That's where he met Victor, a 9-year-old boy from Honduras – and just like that, Estle became a father of five. ""It was a life-changing experience for our family,"" Estle told CBN News.
Estle and his wife became Victor's foster parents. That's when they learned more about him and the circumstances that would make a person travel 1,000 miles into an unknown country.
""For him, in Honduras, it was a combination of fleeing gang violence, fleeing a lack of opportunities for young people and domestic violence was part of the equation,"" Estle explained.
It's a story he says he hears all the time from people crossing illegally into the US.

The idea of separating children from parents isn't new. In fact, past administrations have separated children from their parents, too. But Estle, who also serves as Director of Field and Constituencies of the National Immigration Forum, says this time is a bit different.
In the past, illegal border crossing was treated as a misdemeanor on the first offense for most individuals; therefore there was no need for a criminal prosecution.
""What's happening now is there is no discretion. Everybody is put in this category,"" Estle explained. That also includes asylum seekers who cross illegally.
""A huge difference that should be problematic for people of faith is that we are separating families who are coming to our border in accordance with US and international law to request asylum,"" Estle continued.
Sessions says there is a reason for that.
""The previous administration released most aliens apprehended at the border who requested asylum into the United States with a document asking them to show up for a hearing at some later date,"" the attorney general claimed. ""Word spread quickly that by asserting a fear of returning to one's home country, one could remain in the United States.""
""The results are just what one would expect. The number of illegal entrants has surged,"" he said.
Department of Homeland Security Kristjen Nielsen also defended the policy on Twitter.
This misreporting by Members, press & advocacy groups must stop. It is irresponsible and unproductive. As I have said many times before, if you are seeking asylum for your family, there is no reason to break the law and illegally cross between ports of entry. — Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen (@SecNielsen) June 17, 2018
""As I have said many times before if you are seeking asylum for your family, there is no reason to break the law and illegally cross between ports of entry,"" she wrote.
Christian Leaders Respond
Christian leaders, including Rev. Samuel Rodriguez and Dr. Russell Moore, sent a letter to the administration hoping they'd find a better solution than breaking up families.
""As evangelical Christians guided by the Bible, one of our core convictions is that God has established the family as the fundamental building block of society. The state should separate families only in the rarest of instances,"" the letter reads.
Matthew Soerens, director of Church Mobilization at World Relief, agreed. ""Central for us at World Relief is our belief that every human being is made in the image of God,"" he explained. ""We find that at the beginning of the Bible and that needs to be the foundation, both as we think about refugees who are fleeing persecutions or immigrants who are seeking a better life in the United States.""
Sen. James Lankford (R-OK), who also serves as a pastor, says he too hopes there is a better way. ""Clearly, God's design is for a family unit,"" Lankford said.
Meanwhile, in an interview with CBN News, evangelist Franklin Graham called the situation ""disgraceful"" and blamed years of inaction from lawmakers.
Sessions says the biblical thing would be for people to obey the law.
""I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13 – to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained the government for his purposes,"" said Sessions.
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is laying the blame at the feet of Democrats.
""I hate the children being taken away. The Democrats have to change their law. That's their law,"" the president said Friday.
Democratic leaders say that isn't so, insisting the separation is a direct result of the no-tolerance policy. ""Let me be clear: That's false. No law requires this action,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA).
In a speech last week, Sessions faulted the Obama administration for failing to prosecute all illegal border crossers.
""The previous administration wouldn't prosecute illegal aliens who entered the country with children. It was de facto open borders,"" Sessions charged.
""The results were unsurprising,"" he continued. ""More and more illegal aliens started showing up at the border with children.""
While true, this admission seems to prove the idea that criminally prosecuting all offenders is, in fact, unique to this administration, thus resulting in an uptick of separated families.
When asked about immigration reform on Monday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders responded, ""The president isn’t trying to kick the can down the road. He’s trying to work with Congress.""
""He wants to actually fix the problem,"" she said. ""This isn’t just something we can tinker with. We have to fix the entire problem.""
Sanders also said any evangelical or any church that feels strongly should open up their doors if that’s their calling -- the mission of the church.
""If they want to fix the immigration problem,"" she stressed. ""They should call their members of Congress."""
4791,US child migrants: First ladies speak out on Trump separation policy',BBC News,6/18/2018,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44515123,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Zero-tolerance: The US policy dividing families and opinion
The former US First Lady Laura Bush has condemned a controversial policy that splits up families who illegally enter the country at the Mexican border.
Writing in the Washington Post newspaper, she describes the separation of children from their parents as cruel, immoral and heart-breaking.
Her comments follow growing controversy over President Donald Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy.
Earlier Melania Trump made a rare statement expressing concern.
Mrs Trump ""hates to see children separated from their families"", her spokeswoman said.
She repeated her husband's call for ""both sides"" to work on immigration reform as a solution. However, fact-checkers point out that the policy was introduced by Mr Trump's attorney general and does not require congressional action to be stopped.
In a recent six-week period there were nearly 2,000 family separations following a crackdown on illegal border crossings.
Adults who try to cross the border outside of official entry points - many planning to seek asylum - are placed in custody and face criminal prosecution for illegal entry.
As a result, hundreds of children and babies are now being housed in detention centres, including warehouses and converted supermarkets, and kept away from their parents.
What's been said?
Laura Bush, wife of the former Republican President George W Bush and a Texas resident, launched an outspoken attack on the policy.
""This zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart,"" she wrote in the Washington Post.
""Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert.""
Image copyright Reuters/Getty Images Image caption Laura Bush, left, and Melania Trump have both spoken out about the treatment of child migrants
""These images are eerily reminiscent of the Japanese American internment camps of World War Two, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in US history,"" she added.
Earlier Mrs Trump said she ""hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle [Republicans and Democrats in Congress] can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform"".
""We need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart,"" her statement added.
The first ladies' comments come amid growing alarm over the impact of the policy.
On Monday, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called on the US to end what he called its ""unconscionable"" strategy of forced separations.
Earlier Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended her agency's role at the border, saying: ""We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period.""
But she said authorities would remove children if the parent they were travelling with had broken the law.
Who is to blame?
Mr Trump has said a law ""Democrats gave us"" is responsible for the policy, but it is unclear which law he is referring to.
In a tweet on Saturday he urged Democrats to work with Republicans to create new legislation.
However, critics have pointed out that detaining children separately from their parents is the consequence of a policy announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions last month to deter new arrivals.
The significant change, analysts say, is the justice department's decision to prosecute parents if they illegally cross the border, even if it is their first offence. The children are not charged with a crime, which means they cannot be jailed together.

Until this policy was announced, such families were usually subject to civil deportation proceedings, which did not require separation.
What's happening now?
The recent child detentions have resulted in some shelters and foster homes reporting that they are running out of space.
On Sunday, Democratic lawmakers visited shelters and processing facilities in New Jersey and Texas, demanding to see detainees.
""They call it zero-tolerance, but a better name for it is zero-humanity. And there is zero logic to this,"" Sen Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who organised a visit to Casa Padre detention centre in Brownsville, Texas, told the BBC.
""What we saw is this huge warehouse, it was a super centre for Walmart before, now it's a super detention centre. It's holding almost 1,500 kids inside there.""
Vermont congressman Peter Welch said he saw children held ""in chain link cages"" in a processing facility and one shelter ""filled to capacity"".
Meanwhile, officials announced plans to erect tent cities that will hold hundreds more children in the Texas desert where temperatures regularly reach 40C (105F).
Local lawmaker Jose Rodriguez described the plan as ""totally inhumane"" and ""outrageous"", adding: ""It should be condemned by anyone who has a moral sense of responsibility.""
Protesters marched to one such tent city in Tornillo, Texas, on Sunday where hundreds of children were being held separately from their parents.
They chanted ""Families united!"" and ""Free our children now!"", reported NPR.
The policy faces legal challenges, including a federal case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
Is the policy working?
The number of families trying to enter the US overland without documentation is on the rise.
In the first two weeks of the new ""zero-tolerance"" approach, 658 minors - including many babies and toddlers - were separated from the adults that travelled with them, according to US border officials.
In many of the cases, the families have been reunited after the parent was released from detention. However, there are reports of people being kept apart for weeks and even months.
But it is not clear if this new tougher policy will stop the migrants from travelling.
This is because many are fleeing violence and poverty in countries such as Honduras and El Salvador, and staying put is often fraught with dangers."
5685,OPINION: Outrage grows as families are separated. Will Trump change his policy?',CNN - Editorial,6/18/2018,,,https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/18/politics/immigration-trump-congress-family-separation/index.html,"(CNN) The White House's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy and resulting separations of undocumented parents and kids is exploding into the most emotive and politically unpredictable test yet of President Donald Trump's effort to change the character of America.
As outrage grows over traumatic stories of families being torn apart, the big question this week in Washington is how long the controversial practice will be politically sustainable amid a wave of criticism.
A related issue is whether Trump will pay a political price for his false claim that the separations are the fault of Democrats, and not the result of his own administration's change in how undocumented immigrants are treated.
Those questions are likely to be shaped by increasing calls for the administration to consider the morality of separating families. It's not just the usual Democrats who are criticizing the administration -- some prominent Republicans, including first lady Melania Trump and former first lady Laura Bush, religious leaders and influential figures in Trump's conservative evangelical base are also speaking out.
""It's an atrocious policy,"" former White House communications director and Trump ally Anthony Scaramucci said on CNN's ""New Day"" Monday. ""It's inhumane. It's offensive to the average American.""
Still, the President continued to press Democrats to climb down on their opposition to sweeping changes he wants to make to the immigration system.
""Why don't the Democrats give us the votes to fix the world's worst immigration laws? Where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs, including MS-13, coming into our country illegally?"" the President tweeted Monday morning.
Why don't the Democrats give us the votes to fix the world's worst immigration laws? Where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs, including MS-13, coming into our country illegally? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018
Critics argue that the separations are cruel and un-American, using the issue to try to build a tide of distaste against the President and the GOP ahead of midterm elections.
A rare foray into politics by the former first lady significantly cranked up the political heat.
Bush said she appreciated the need to protect the border, but added, ""This zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart.""
""Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert outside of El Paso,"" Bush wrote. ""These images are eerily reminiscent of the Japanese American internment camps of World War II, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in U.S. history.""
Current first lady Melania Trump also expressed concern about the situation, though she did not break with her husband's position that only Congress can stop the separations.
""Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,"" her communications director, Stephanie Grisham, told CNN on Sunday.
Religious leaders, including Cardinal Timothy Dolan and Franklin Graham, a key Trump ally, also faulted the morality of the separations last week.
Will Trump break with base?
Yet despite rising anger, it remains unclear whether the President is willing to risk the personal embarrassment, and potentially a backlash from his base, that a change of course might stir.
Trump's uncanny connection with his loyal voters has been highlighted time and again over immigration and his core promise to introduce a much tougher policy -- even if it has grave humanitarian consequences that critics and outsiders see as immoral.
It would not be surprising if the President feels that any shift in his line under rising media pressure and liberal fury makes it impossible for him to climb down.
It also remains to be see whether this issue -- as heart-wrenching and poignant as it is -- has the power to shatter entrenched political positions that have thwarted a decade-and-a-half of efforts by Congress to reform the immigration system.
Could it prompt Trump voters, for instance, to soften their belief that the border crossings are illegal and those who transgress get the treatment they deserve?
That seems unlikely. But the separations storm is injecting an unpredictable dimension to a critical week ahead in the immigration debate that sources tell CNN will include a meeting between Trump and GOP lawmakers on Tuesday.
The House of Representatives is meanwhile poised to consider a measure that could deal with the fate of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program recipients -- undocumented migrants brought to the US as children -- as well as funding for Trump's border wall and a sweeping overhaul of the system of legal immigration.
Controversy over the separations dominated the political weekend.
Senate candidate and Texas Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke on Sunday branded the separations ""inhumane.""
""I'd like to say it's un-American, but it's happening right now in America. And it is on all of us, not just the Trump administration. This is on all of us,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""
There were clear signs of discomfort at the White House.
Trump's counselor Kellyanne Conway told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that ""nobody likes this policy"" and called on an unnamed official who told The Washington Post that Trump was using it as leverage to come forward and identify himself or herself.
But another key voice in Trump's ear was his former political adviser Steve Bannon, who went on television, in the certain knowledge that the President would end up watching him, and made the case for staying the course despite rising criticism of the White House.
""It's zero tolerance. I don't think you have to justify it. We have a crisis on the southern border,"" Bannon said on ABC's ""This Week.""
Bannon also warned that any bill that guaranteed a path to citizenship for DACA recipients was not just unacceptable but could so irk Trump's base that Republicans could lose 50 seats in the House in November.
""All (Trump has) got to do is listen to his own inner voice,"" Bannon said.
House battle awaits
The House could vote as early as this week on a plan that would address family separations although the legislation would do little to change the underlying practice that has been implemented under the Trump administration.
The compromise bill reverses a court settlement and would now allow children to be held with their parents indefinitely if they are in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security.
But it doesn't do anything to stop the Trump administration from continuing its current practice of prosecuting parents who cross the border without documentation in the criminal justice system. If the administration continues that practice, parents and children would still be separated.
""That's an issue of great concern to me. And we're still looking for ways to do more to keep families together in this legislation,"" Florida Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a key negotiator in the GOP's compromise legislation, told reporters last week.
House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said last week that the administration's practice could be ""changed just like that"" as she snapped her fingers.
The idea that Congress could fix the policy is strewn with obstacles.
To start with, Trump has kept lawmakers guessing about whether he would sign any bill. On Friday, he told Fox News that he had no intention of doing so. But roughly nine hours later -- after a day of speculation and confusion -- the White House issue a statement saying that Trump supported two Republican bills on the issue.
Three sources told CNN that Trump will meet House Republicans at the Capitol on Tuesday to discuss next steps on immigration, a gathering that could seal the fate of the House's hard-fought compromise immigration bill.
Conservatives look to Trump for political cover
If Trump makes a strong endorsement, it could be enough to convince members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus to back the bill. With Trump as a shield against conservative radio, the party base and hard-right immigration groups, conservatives will have a rationale to back a bill that some have expressed concerns would not go far enough to secure the border.
But, if he's lukewarm or non-committal, the future of the House's compromise immigration bill would likely be sunk.
""At the end of the day, his voice on immigration probably carries more weight in the Republican conference than any other voice. And so you have to pay attention to that,"" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters Friday.
Democrats have already said that they oppose the bill, meaning that it's up to Republicans and them alone to get it across the finish line.
Senators are only just beginning to wrestle with the separations.
After spending a week already earlier in the year trying and failing to fix the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, there is little appetite among Republican leaders for a new immigration debate before the midterms.
That could change, however, if the House passes a bill and pressure mounts from the White House for a Senate debate."

The White House on Friday evening walked back Donald Trump’s criticism of a House GOP bill shielding Dreamers from deportation, saying in a statement that the president would sign the legislation.
After a daylong, dizzying back-and-forth over Trump’s position, White House spokesman Raj Shah said Trump misunderstood a question on “Fox & Friends” Friday morning when he argued he would not sign a “moderate” immigration proposal scheduled for a vote next week.

Many on Capitol Hill — and even in the White House — believed Trump was referring to immigration legislation released Thursday, the product of weeks of negotiations between centrist Republicans, conservatives and GOP leaders. But Shah argued that Trump was instead knocking a proposal backed by moderates and Democrats that would codify the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program without any significant immigration crackdown.
“The President fully supports both the Goodlatte bill and the House leadership bill,"" Shah said, referring to a conservative DACA plan that's expected to fail next week, as well as the compromise bill released Thursday.
Trump, he added, ""would sign either.""
Trump’s apparent embrace of the bill is a boon to House leaders hoping to pass the text next week. Conservatives need the president to give them cover to vote for a bill that includes a pathway to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.
The vote is still expected to fall short because of opposition from immigration hardliners and some GOP centrists. But Trump's apparent criticism Friday morning would have led to an embarrassing spectacle in which only a few dozen lawmakers supported the plan, some leadership sources speculated.
Trump's earlier comments Friday might still spook skittish lawmakers, making passage difficult. The president has big-footed senior White House officials before, catching them off-guard and reversing official White House positions without so much as a warning. Republicans will spend all next week fretting about a repeat of such a situation.
The White House's support of the bill isn't entirely surprising. The new House proposal mirrors Trump's own framework to increase security, curb legal immigration and shield Dreamers from deportation. Not only that, top White House officials, including immigration hawk Stephen Miller, were working behind the scenes to whip support for the document. And the White House had drafted a policy statement saying the president would sign the bill.
But Trump heard conservative criticism of the proposal on TV, according to senior Republicans, and swatted the proposal down Friday morning.
“I’m looking at both of them,” Trump told “Fox & Friends” in an interview Friday morning from the White House lawn. “I certainly wouldn’t sign the more moderate one.”

Hours later, the president added to the confusion with a tweet that demanded provisions that the compromise bill seemingly includes. “Any Immigration Bill MUST HAVE full funding for the Wall, end Catch & Release, Visa Lottery and Chain, and go to Merit Based Immigration. Go for it!“ he wrote.
Before Shah's clarification, the president's statement appeared to have dealt a fatal blow to the bill. GOP leaders knew few Republicans would back a bill Trump rejected, so they delayed a planned vote-counting session slated for Friday.
House Majority Whip Steve Scalise even threatened to withdraw his support for the package. His office told Breitbart that the Louisiana Republican, who wants to be speaker someday, would not whip support for any immigration bill the president opposed.
After the morning interview, GOP leaders and White House aides scrambled to get Trump back on message. And early on, senior Republicans predicted that Trump would not only walk back his comments but fully endorse the compromise bill. His comments on TV, they said, left him enough wiggle room to say he was discussing a Democratic proposal that did not include his wall.
That's exactly what the White House did — it just took more than eight hours.
Before the White House clarification, however, some conservatives applauded the president.
""He's correctly judging the American people's opinion on this subject; we're not there yet,"" said Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.). Asked what more he needed in the compromise bill, Perry seemed aghast: ""Enforcement! Enforcement! We can't keep on having these half-measures that don't fix the problem.""
Trump's initial comments came after Ryan and other members of the House leadership team told reporters that they’d described their bill to the president and he was “excited” about it. Ryan has stressed to reporters that he has been working ""hand in glove"" with the administration in writing the bill.
Indeed, senior White House policy adviser Miller came to Capitol Hill earlier this week to encourage wary conservatives fearful of backlash from the base to support the plan. And GOP leaders in meetings talked about the possibility of Trump as well as the White House helping them whip support.
Had the White House not reversed Trump's position, GOP leaders would have found themselves backed into a corner, having to ask Republicans to vote against their own president on a controversial topic that divides the party most.
Leaders told worried Republicans to keep calm on Friday and that a statement clearing things up would eventually follow.
""We're waiting for some clarification on what that really means,"" said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.). ""We don't know.""
Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), who helped craft the compromise bill, said he was told that Trump ""will sign it.""
""I think once he has a chance to digest it, he will sign it,"" Diaz-Balart said, though he declined to say who told him that, and cautioned that it would have to be verified with the White House. Diaz-Balart admitted Republicans ""have a big problem"" if Congress backs a compromise package and he vetoes it. ""We need the president to look at it, and look at in detail... But I am hoping we can get his support.""
Trump's initial remarks seemed to be a rebuke to Ryan and his team, who’ve spent hours huddled in the speaker’s office trying to hash out an immigration bill that moderate Republicans from districts with big Latino populations and conservatives could back. Both sides have given ground in the talks: Moderates begrudgingly accepted strict enforcement measures, while conservatives for the first time were open to providing citizenship for Dreamers.
What’s more, the GOP plan reflected Trump’s own “four pillars” proposal that includes a pathway to citizenship, an end to the diversity visa lottery program, curbs on family migration and $25 billion for the border wall. It would also increase border security and interior enforcement.
Trump's rejection of the bill would have been a huge blow to moderate Republicans who this spring forced the immigration matter to the forefront. Banding with Democrats, they threatened to take over the floor, circumvent their own party and pass legislation to shield Dreamers from deportation — unless Republicans could agree on their own plan to address the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
That set off the intense negotiating sessions that led to the compromise bill released Thursday.

Breaking an hours-long silence, White House spokesman Raj Shah said Mr. Trump is backing both the GOP leaders’ bill and a more enforcement-heavy version from conservatives. Both are expected to be put up for votes next week on the House floor.
“The president fully supports both the Goodlatte bill and the House leadership bill,” Mr. Shah said. “In this morning’s interview, he was commenting on the discharge petition in the House, and not the new package. He would sign either the Goodlatte or the leadership bills.”
Mr. Trump threw the House GOP into turmoil early Friday morning when, in an interview with Fox News, he rejected the “moderate” bill.
Steve Doocy, the Fox interviewer, asked about both bills, referring to one as the Goodlatte bill, sponsored by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, and the other as a more “moderate” bill.
“I’m looking at both of them. I certainly wouldn’t sign the more moderate one,” Mr. Trump replied.
Compounding matters, Mr. Trump had a chance to clean up the mess in an afternoon tweet but failed to do so, instead laying out his principles he wanted to see.
The bizarre twist is that the GOP leaders’ legislation perfectly matches Mr. Trump’s “four pillar” principles, granting legal status to perhaps 2 million illegal immigrants, funding his border wall, ending the visa lottery and curtailing the chain of family migration.
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan had said they wrote the bill “hand-in-glove” with the administration.
Conservatives said Friday they expected Mr. Trump to issue a new statement cleaning up his remark.
Yet one source from a group that supports an immigration crackdown said the comment wasn’t a mistake and Mr. Trump did have misgivings.
Conservative Republicans are reluctant to tackle any bill that grants citizenship rights to illegal immigrants without Mr. Trump on board, fearing a massive backlash from conservative activists. They’re counting on Mr. Trump to provide political cover against those who will call the bill a blanket amnesty.

“This is because of a court ruling,” Ryan said Thursday during a press conference. He went on to repeat the claim three times.
The speaker said he was not comfortable with family separations occurring at the border and that “we don’t want kids to be separated from their parents.” While he condemned the result, he brushed off Trump’s role in the policy his administration instituted, instead blaming it on a 1997 court settlement that no other president has interpreted to necessitate splitting up families en masse.
Ryan said that the solution is a legislative change to address the court decision, which a spokeswoman confirmed was a reference to the 1997 Flores settlement, which bars the government from detaining children for long periods, including with their parents. He didn’t get into details on what that would mean. But the proposal pushed by the White House isn’t to let kids live outside detention rather than split them from their parents: It’s to keep them all locked up together, potentially for months or even years.
“What’s happening at the border and the separation of parents and their children is because of a court ruling,” Ryan said. “That’s why I think legislation is necessary.”
House Republicans are working on a compromise immigration bill to be considered next week, along with a restrictionist-favored bill. A measure to limit family separation at the border is expected to be part of that legislation, likely in the form of changes to address the Flores settlement. The White House also supports policies to speed up removal of unauthorized immigrant families and kids.
The current family separation policy relates to the Flores settlement only in the sense that the Trump administration would rather split up families than allow them to be released from detention while their cases go through the courts.
In reality, family separations are due to the Trump administration’s new zero tolerance policy for illegal entry, which necessitates locking up parents separately so they can be criminally prosecuted. Previously, officials often used their discretion to put families detained at the border in immigration proceedings rather than split them up.
When a reporter pointed out the separations were a result of the administration’s zero tolerance policy, Ryan replied that “there’s also a court ruling involved” and called for a legislative fix.
Trump has blamed the policy on a “horrible law” pushed by Democrats ― there is no such law ― and called for a legislative fix.
Child welfare experts say family separations are highly damaging for children, some of whom have already undergone trauma in their native country or during their journey to the U.S. But family immigrant detention is not considered a healthy place for children, either, and can have long-term effects on a child’s development.
Immigrant rights activists and Democrats fought family immigrant detention under President Barack Obama and do not consider it a viable alternative to splitting up parents and kids.
“That also has tremendous traumatic impact on the family unit,” Wendy Young, the president of the immigrant child protection group Kids in Need of Defense, said Thursday on a call with reporters. “Family separation is obviously the next step backwards and is even harsher than that, but we do not support family detention as the solution.”"
5974,House Republicans look to unite party on plan for immigration reform',Washington Times,6/14/2018,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jun/13/house-republicans-look-to-unite-party-on-plan-for-/,"Republicans tried to build support Wednesday for their compromise immigration plan, saying they’ve come up with something that can unite the GOP and get President Trump’s signature.
Preparing for the first major House immigration floor debate in eight years, Speaker Paul D. Ryan was hashing out final details on the compromise, which he will put up for votes next week.
“This has a chance of going into law,” Mr. Ryan said after a party caucus meeting Wednesday.
According to a draft outline, the plan the GOP is working on would allow “Dreamers,” those who illegally crossed into the U.S. as children, to get in line for citizenship.
The plan would also authorize and fund Mr. Trump’s border wall, raise the burden of proof on asylum claims, allow faster deportation of some illegal immigrants including children, limit the chain of family migration and eliminate the diversity visa lottery that doles out 55,000 immigration passes each year.
And the bill would explicitly prevent separation of children from their parents at the border, according to the draft.
Still to be decided is the size and details of the pathway to citizenship. One option would only cover Dreamers, while another option would cover children whose parents came on temporary legal visas.
The White House signaled its support for the plan, though many rank-and-file Republicans were waiting to see the final bill.
Rep. Mark Meadows, the head of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said the president could sway members.
“Could he move 100 people because he says he likes it? The answer is ‘No,’” Mr. Meadows said. “Can he move a dozen or so? The answer is ‘Yes.’ “
GOP leaders dodged a bullet this week after a renegade group of moderate Republicans failed to muster enough support for a petition drive that would have forced voted on a series of bills, including a Democrat-backed option with a more generous amnesty and far less enforcement.
Instead, the GOP will allow two votes: one on the compromise still being worked out, and the other on an enforcement-heavy bill authored by House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte.
Mr. Goodlatte’s bill would write President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program into law, granting Dreamers a firmer legal footing but without the new pathway to citizenship that many have demanded.
That bill is not expected to win a majority.
Instead, the attention is on the compromise, which Mr. Ryan says matches the four pillars of reform Mr. Trump laid out earlier this year.
“We’ve been working hand-in-glove with the administration on this, to make sure that we’re bringing a bill that represents the president’s four pillars so that we can come together, have the votes that everybody’s looking for,” he said.
Mr. Trump’s “four pillars” blueprint called for a pathway to citizenship for up to 1.8 million illegal immigrants, combined with his border wall, elimination of the visa lottery and limits to the number of family members a legal immigrant could sponsor.
Rep. Scott Perry, Pennsylvania Republican and member of the Freedom Caucus, said the “devil is in the details” of the compromise — in particular when it comes to security. “We all just need to take a breath and see what we’ve got before we get too excited about it one way or the other,” Mr. Perry said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Since the government acknowledged last month that the Trump administration had lost track of nearly 1,500 immigrant children, the debate over what that means and who is to blame has roiled Twitter. Here’s a look at the partisan claims and a reality check behind the latest immigration fight:
THE 2014 PHOTOS
—“Speechless. This is not who we are as a nation.” — Democrat Antonio Villaraigosa, former Los Angeles mayor now running for governor, referring in a tweet Sunday to photos showing young-looking immigrants in steel cages.
ADVERTISEMENT
—“This is happening right now, and the only debate that matters is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible.” — Jon Favreau, who was speechwriter for President Barack Obama, referring Sunday to the same photos.
THE FACTS: The photos, taken by The Associated Press, were from 2014, during the Obama administration, but were presented by liberal activists as if they showed the effects of Trump’s immigration policy now. Villaraigosa, Favreau and some others deleted their tweets when the mistake was pointed out.
They had linked to a June 2014 online story by The Arizona Republic titled “First peek: Immigrant children flood detention center.” The story featured photos taken by AP’s Ross D. Franklin at a center run by the Customs and Border Protection Agency in Nogales, Arizona. One photo shows two unidentified female detainees sleeping in a holding cell. The caption refers to U.S. efforts to process 47,000 unaccompanied children at the Nogales center and another one in Brownsville, Texas.
Many tweets used the hashtag “WhereAreOurChildren,” which grew out of testimony in April by a federal official that the U.S. government had lost track of nearly 1,500 unaccompanied minor children it placed with adult sponsors in the U.S.
Trump tweeted: “Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama’s term showing children from the Border in steel cages. They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires.”
He is right about the misrepresentation, though it’s not clear that many prominent Democrats jumped on this particular Twitter bandwagon.

THE ‘LOST’ CHILDREN
—“1500 innocent children ripped from their mothers’ arms at our border. Lost in Trump’s “system”. Give us your tired, your poor, your huddle masses yearning to breathe free — and we will torture them for wanting a better life. From Shining City to Evil Empire in under 500 days.” — tweet Sunday by actor Jim Carrey.
—“What is more shameful than forcibly separating, in America, parents from infant children at the border? And then, losing track of those children?” — tweet Friday by Preet Bharara, fired by Trump as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.
THE FACTS: The nearly 1,500 children in question arrived at the border without their parents and were not forced from them by U.S. authorities. Critics are conflating those children with others, who came to the border with their parents, only to be separated there.
To call the children lost, as many have, is misleading. It’s more accurate to say the government lost track of them, as Bharara put it.
An official from the Health and Human Services Department told a congressional hearing last month that his department placed follow-up phone calls from October to December to U.S. households that were sponsoring the minors after they came to the border without their parents. They reached 86 percent of the children or sponsors, determining 6,075 remained with their sponsors, 28 had run away, five had been removed from the U.S. and 52 relocated to live with someone else.
The department could not verify the whereabouts of 1,475. In some of many cases, sponsors simply didn’t respond to the follow-up phone call, not surprising because many are in the U.S. illegally and reluctant to speak to authorities. HHS decided 792 of those cases merited more attention and referred them to the National Call Center.
It’s not highly unusual to fail to keep track of many minors who came unaccompanied to the border.
During the last year of the Obama administration, HHS was able to locate 85 percent of the minors or their sponsors, according to an inspector general’s report. The Trump administration slightly exceeded that success rate in the last three months of 2017, even as it is accused of losing children.
___
ZERO TOLERANCE
—TRUMP: “Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S.” — tweet Saturday.
THE FACTS: No law mandates that parents must be separated from their children at the border, and it’s not a policy Democrats have pushed or can change alone as the minority in Congress. The policy comes from Trump’s own administration, which has decided to enforce criminal charges against people crossing the border illegally with few or no previous offenses. Under U.S. protocol, if parents are jailed, their children would be separated from them.
Discussing the zero-tolerance policy recently, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said: “If we do our duty and prosecute those cases, then children inevitably for a period of time might be in different conditions.”
A Customs and Border Protection official told lawmakers last week that 658 children had been separated from their parents at the border from May 6 to May 19, after border agents began referring every illegal entry to criminal prosecutors. This is in addition to hundreds more who were estimated to have been removed from their parents at the border since October.
A 2008 law, passed unanimously by Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush, says children traveling alone from countries other than Mexico or Canada must be released in the “least restrictive setting” — often to family or a government-run shelter — while their cases slowly wind through immigration court. The law came amid concerns about border control officials and their treatment of children.

3137,The real immigration crisis isn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cmissing\xe2\x80\x9d children. It\xe2\x80\x99s family separations.',Vox,5/31/2018,,,https://www.vox.com/2018/5/30/17405992/family-separations-missing-migrant-children,"Thousands of Twitter users spent the weekend asking #WhereAreTheChildren?
The viral hashtag sprang up in response to a now widely shared New York Times article noting that the federal government had been unable to make contact with 1,475 unaccompanied minors awaiting deportation hearings.
First things first: Despite reports to the contrary, those children are not “missing” or “misplaced.”
Immigration experts point out that these children are not in government custody, nor are they supposed to be. Instead, this is a population of minors who arrived at the US border unaccompanied by parents or adults, were then detained by immigration authorities, and then were largely released into the care of parents and other close relatives.
The government recently tried to reach about 7,600 of these children with a single phone call each. In 1,475 cases, those phone calls went unanswered — the so-called “missing.”
But as Diane Eikenberry, associate director of policy at the National Immigrant Justice Center, puts it, “If you can’t reach somebody after one phone call, you usually would not describe that person as missing.” (You can read a more in-depth interview on the “missing” children here.)
Immigration advocates like Eikenberry aren’t spending a lot of time worried about #WhereAreTheChildren. Instead, they say the real crisis is the Trump administration’s new policy of separating undocumented families apprehended at the US border — a policy that may have gotten conflated with the “missing” children story that went viral this weekend.
Both stories raised concerns about the same issue: how the United States treats children who enter the country without legal status. But advocates worry significantly more about the new policy of separation than the so-called “missing” children. They fear that this policy — which has already led to more than 600 children being separated from their parents — will create traumatic situations for families and overwhelm the very immigration infrastructure put in place to protect these minors.
The real crisis advocates worry about: the separation of migrant families at the border
The Trump administration announced on May 7 that it would begin separating all families apprehended at the border, trying to cross into the United States without documentation.
My colleague Dara Lind has a helpful rundown of how this policy came about:
An increasing share of border crossers seeking asylum come as “family units”: one or more adults with one or more children. (The Trump administration refers to them as “purported ‘family units’” to underline the fact that they could be lying about their family relationship.) And it’s much harder for the government to detain whole immigrant families than it is for them to detain adults. Federal court rulings have set strict standards on the conditions under which families can be detained. Under the Obama administration, courts ruled that they couldn’t be kept in detention for more than 20 days. The Trump administration’s solution, now codified in policy, is to stop treating them as families: to detain the parents as adults and place the children in the custody of Health and Human Services as “unaccompanied minors.” In some cases, according to immigration lawyers, parents separated from their children have begged to withdraw their asylum applications — on the logic that it would be easier for them to reunify their families in their home countries.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has described this as a “zero tolerance” policy. “If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple,” he said in a statement earlier this month.
When pressed by NPR on whether this policy was “cruel and heartless,” White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told NPR, “The children will be taken care of — put into foster care or whatever.”
For families facing the prospect of children in “foster care or whatever,” the reality can be devastating. Lomi Kriel, a reporter for the Houston Chronicle, recently wrote about a 28-year-old father who was separated from his 18-month-old son last summer, after the pair were apprehended at the southern border, crossing without documentation:
Esteban Pastor hoped U.S. Border Patrol agents would free him and his 18-month-old son after they were arrested for crossing the southern border illegally last summer. He had mortgaged his land in Guatemala to fund his sick toddler’s hospital stay, and needed to work in the United States to pay off the loan. Instead agents imprisoned the 28-year-old in July for coming back into the country after having been deported, a felony. They placed the toddler in a federal shelter, though where, Pastor didn’t know. Three months later, in October, the father was deported — alone. His child, he said agents told him, was “somewhere in Texas.” “I cried. I begged,” he said. “No one could tell me anything.”
Hundreds of these situations are playing out now for families that tried to cross into the United States. The Trump administration estimates that it has apprehended 638 adults trying to cross into the country without documentation since the new separation policy began. They were traveling with a total of 658 children.
This is beyond other family separations that occurred — perhaps as many as 700 of them, according to New York Times reporting — before the Trump administration announced this official change in policy.
And keep in mind that these individuals have not been convicted of crimes. Many are arriving in the United States planning to seek asylum from horrific violence in Central America, particularly Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The United Nations estimates that the number of refugees seeking asylum from these places has increased sixteenfold since 2011.
“We’re a bit in panic mode”
Immigration advocates are worried about what these separations will mean for the minors going forward in the United States. There is the obvious trauma of losing contact with a parent, especially for the youngest children.
“The children we talk to in government custody, their number one concern is often how quickly they can get to the person they see as their family figure,” Eikenberry says. “For young kids, that is all they can think about.”
Those facilities can be a tough place for children to live. “These facilities do have a little bit of an education program, but it’s still federal detention,” says Jennifer Podkul, director of policy at Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a nonprofit based in Washington, DC, that represents unaccompanied minors in court. “Even low-security facilities have barbed-wire fences around them, and communication with those outside is monitored. Everybody knows that detention is not good for kids.”
Most of these minors are likely to be released from detention into the care of a close relative. This is the goal in the case of children who arrive unaccompanied as well as those separated from their family (although with those recently separated from their family, it may be more challenging as their parent is in government custody).
The government agency that oversees this program estimates that, on average, unaccompanied children spend 51 days in these facilities — and in 2017, 93 percent were released into the care of guardians, largely parents and other close family members.
But even then, the separation of families at the border could mean that this group of children has a worse chance at making a case for asylum in the United States.
Advocates worry about two distinct hurdles. First, the separation policy creates a larger number of unaccompanied minors in the United States — which means a bigger pool of children vying for limited attorney services from the pro bono firms that typically take their cases.
KIND, where Podkul works, is one of those organizations — and it’s already worried about how it will handle the uptick in minors who are facing deportation hearings on their own.
“We’re a bit in panic mode,” says Podkul. “There are very limited organizations that have this specialty and provide these services; less than half of children get representation, and now they’ve just added 600-plus kids.”
That could have real effects for children, as those who receive representation are significantly more likely to win in deportation hearings. One 2014 study found that unaccompanied minors with representation have a 73 percent chance of winning their case, compared to just 15 percent for those without an attorney.
What’s more, Podkul says that children are less able to defend themselves against deportation hearings when they aren’t able to contact their parents.
The parents, for example, likely know better why they believe their children ought to be given asylum in the United States. They’re more likely to be carrying the paperwork to make that case too.
“These cases get a lot harder when these kids are separated from an adult,” says Podkul. “If a child has traveled with an adult, the parent often knows the full story of why they’re seeking asylum. They have documents like birth certificates or police reports. But once these kids are separated, they’ve lost communication. It makes our job a lot harder.”
Why the 1,500 “missing” children aren’t a top concern for immigration advocates
On April 28, Steven Wagner testified before a Senate subcommittee on homeland security. Wagner runs the Administration for Children and Families, a federal agency that oversees the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).
ORR is responsible for oversight of unaccompanied minors awaiting a court hearing on their immigration status, a process that can take years. And while these minors do spend some time in government-run shelters and facilities after their apprehension, ORR typically attempts to place most children with a family member who agrees to take custody.
In 2017, ORR estimated that these children spent an average of 51 days in a government facility before being released to outside custody (in 2018, that number appears to have risen to 57). Of the 93 percent of kids in detention who were ultimately released to a guardian outside of the government, about half (49 percent) went to their parents, 41 percent to another close relative, and an additional 10 percent to “other-than-close relatives or non-relatives.”
“There is an actual statutory mandate that these children are supposed to be placed into the least restrictive setting,” Eikenberry says. “In almost every case, this is with a family caregiver, not in some sort of detention.”
In late 2014, ORR began to place phone calls to those family caregivers 30 days after the child is placed in the new home. This is what Wagner was describing when he told Congress about what his agency learned from those phone calls in late 2017. Here’s the relevant part of his testimony:
From October to December 2017, ORR attempted to reach 7,635 UAC and their sponsors. Of this number, ORR reached and received agreement to participate in the safety and well-being call from approximately 86 percent of sponsors. From these calls, ORR learned that 6,075 UAC remained with their sponsors. Twenty-eight UAC had run away, five had been removed from the United States, and 52 had relocated to live with a non-sponsor. ORR was unable to determine with certainty the whereabouts of 1,475 UAC.
In other words: 1,475 of 7,635 phone calls to the sponsors of unaccompanied children were not picked up. Immigration advocates don’t find this figure especially concerning. They say there are plenty of reasons why families might miss a phone call, ranging from boring logistics to more widespread fears of the federal government.
“A lot of these families may have a pay-as-you-go phone number,” says Podkul at KIND. “I definitely had times when I couldn’t get ahold of a client for weeks. [There is also] a climate of fear. Parents and families that are undocumented might be scared to pick up the phone.”
Immigration advocates are pretty torn on how aggressively the government should track unaccompanied minors — whether it’s actually a problem that there isn’t more than a phone call made to ascertain this population’s whereabouts.
On the one hand, immigration advocates want to make sure that unaccompanied minors are getting the services and support that they need. Podkul, for example, thinks it’s important to ensure that these children have access to representation as they move through court proceedings on their immigration status.
At the same time, advocates worry about aggressive monitoring of this same population, particularly if the United States wants to use that information as a means to surveil unaccompanied minors in a way to obtain information that could be used against them in deportation hearings.
“It worries me because of all the other ways we see the Trump administration enforcing these types of laws and policies; it serves pretty restrictive ends,” Eikenberry says. “If not done with a more holistic goal of keeping these kids safe and healthy, I definitely fear that lens being turned on children.”"
3384,Remember those brutal immigrant detention centers liberals tried to pin on Trump? It was all Obama',Washington Examiner,5/31/2018,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/remember-those-brutal-immigrant-detention-centers-liberals-tried-to-pin-on-trump-it-was-all-obama,"Liberals and even ostensibly objective journalists are experts at getting themselves outraged. But only if they think that an abuse is occurring under President Trump.
Over Memorial Day Weekend, former Obama White House speechwriter Jon Favreau attempted to pin the blame of the harsh and brutal conditions for children and families at immigrant detention centers on President Trump.
Favreau tweeted on Sunday, ""Look at these pictures. This is happening right now, and the only debate that matters is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible.""
He then linked to an article in AZcentral titled, ""First glimpse of immigrant children at holding facility."" The picture accompanying the piece looks quite terrible, with kids in the sort of cages you might see in a dog kennel.
But here's the problem: The article and photo are from 2014, when Favreau's boss, Barack Obama, was president, and had been president for five to six years.
The Daily Caller called Favreau out on this, and he has since deleted the tweet. However, that didn't stop others from making their move to gin up outrage to elevate their own platforms.
I saw this photo floating around and didn’t know if it was real.
It is.
Children of immigrants are being held in cages, like dogs, at ICE detention centers, sleeping on the floor. It’s an abomination.

The US Govt is holding migrant children in small cages like they are animals--just as 45 describes them.
This is horrific. This is inhumane. This cannot stand. #ThisIsAmerica https://t.co/JEty91DHvq — Qasim Rashid, Esq. (@MuslimIQ) May 27, 2018
This is monstrous. We are all complicit. https://t.co/eObKaKrAJq — Yes, You're Racist (@YesYoureRacist) May 27, 2018
This level of outrage followed a New York Times report that the Department of Health and Human Services lost nearly 1,500 immigrant children. They then had to walk that claim back saying that these children weren't ""lost,"" but that many of their adult sponsors did not respond to the federal agency.
The lesson that can be learned from this is that Democrats are just as blindly apologetic and complicit in letting the Obama administration mete out the same exact treatment toward immigrant families that they criticize now that Trump is president. They pretend to care about the issue of immigration in the age of Trump, but they were completely silent when their allies were running the show.
And yes, Republicans have, by and large, excused reprehensible and borderline racist behavior coming from President Trump simply because they stand to benefit from his policies. But, at the same time, you've never seen this many Republicans stand up and call out a Republican president for his comments and policies when they believed he's in the wrong. Any moral objections Democrats had to Obama while he was in office were quite vigorously suppressed.
So what's the best strategy to avoid this faux outrage in the future? Start by caring more about your country than your party."
3467,Trump calls for Democrats to end \xe2\x80\x98horrible law\xe2\x80\x99 that he says separates children from parents at border',Fox News (Online),5/27/2018,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/05/26/trump-calls-for-democrats-to-end-horrible-law-that-says-separates-children-from-parents-at-border.html,"President Trump on Saturday called on Democrats to end a “horrible law” that he says separates children from their parents when they cross the border -- and also accused them of “protecting MS-13 thugs.”
“Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there [sic] parents once they cross the Border into the U.S.” he tweeted.
Trump made the remarks amid a pushback from Democrats and activists at a “zero tolerance” policy enforced by the Justice Department. That policy refers all illegal border crossings for prosecution, including illegal immigrants with children.
Those parents are housed at adult detention centers, and consequently their children are separated from them, registered as “unaccompanied minors” and handed to the Department of Health and Human Services.
Trump has blamed Democrats for the separation of children from their parents before. Last week he told Homeland Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen that the breaking up of families occurred because of “bad laws that the Democrats gave us.”
The Associated Press reported that he appeared to be referring to a 2008 law to combat child trafficking -- a bipartisan law authored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., but signed into law by Republican President George W. Bush.
While the law says nothing about separating families, it does say that children travelling alone from countries other than Mexico and Canada must be released in the “least restrictive setting” -- namely a family or shelter.
The Justice Department’s zero-tolerance policy, designed to deter prospective illegal immigrants, means that illegal immigrants are no longer released with their children into the U.S. and consequently that their children are separated from them.
“If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple,” Sessions said earlier this month. “If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you. And that child may be separated from you, as required by law.”
SESSIONS SAYS ALL ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED; CHILDREN MAY BE SEPARATED FROM PARENTS
But Trump called on Democratic lawmakers to end the practice, apparently as part of a deal that includes the ending of so-called “catch and release” whereby illegal immigrants are released into America while they wait for their court hearing. He also said that the diversity lottery visa and so-called chain migration -- where immigrants can sponsor family members for visas -- must end.
“Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL!” he tweeted.
He also returned to accusing Democrats of “protecting” MS-13 gang members. He has said repeatedly that their opposition to strong border policies, as well as the promotion of “sanctuary policies” in states like California and New York, mean criminal gang members get released back into communities.
“Democrats are protecting MS-13 thugs,” he tweeted.
Trump was criticized by Democrats for describing MS-13 members as “animals.” This week he accused Democrats of “trying to defend” them, noting that he was criticized for his remarks by Democratic leaders Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-NY.
Fox News' Samuel Chamberlain and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

But as of May, the Trump administration is sending all parents to jails run by the U.S. Marshals Service. Because migrant children cannot be held in jails, they are placed elsewhere by the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement. Before the Trump administration, the office handled children who crossed the border alone.
White House chief of staff John Kelly, who called the harsh new policy a “technique” and a “tough deterrent,” explained earlier this month to NPR: “They’ll be sent to foster care — or whatever. But the big point is they elected to come illegally into the United States.”

In their latest “seven-figure project” to promote amnesty for illegal aliens, the Koch brothers are thanking Democrats and their open borders agenda in mailers.
The Koch mailers, revealed by NPR, thank Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-CA), Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-CA), Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), Rep. Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), and Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) for their push for open borders and amnesty for illegal aliens.
The mailer campaign by the Koch brothers also thanks a number of Republicans for supporting their agenda of open borders and amnesty.
As Breitbart News has chronicled, the Koch brothers have attempted to shape the Republican Congressional agenda ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.
Despite midterm voters repeatedly saying they want less immigration to the U.S., the Koch brothers have pushed GOP lawmakers to endorse amnesty for illegal aliens and have set out on a campaign opposing Trump’s popular plan to cut legal immigration levels.
Paul Ryan, GOP Establishment Look to Fulfill Koch Brothers’ Wage-Crushing Amnesty Dreams Ahead of Midtermshttps://t.co/E3VJq8fArV — John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) April 19, 2018
Currently, the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million legal and illegal immigrants every year, with more than 70 percent coming to the country through chain migration. In the next 20 years, the current U.S. legal immigration system is on track to import roughly 15 million new foreign-born voters. Between seven and eight million of those foreign-born voters will arrive in the U.S. through chain migration.
The Koch brothers have said they oppose wage-boosting cuts to legal immigration levels, Breitbart News reported.
The slightly tightened labor market — a result of Trump’s increased border security and economic nationalist vision, which is opposed by the Koch brothers — has secured high-paying industry jobs for American teens, as well as history-making wage growth for American workers in the construction industry, the garment industry, for workers employed at small businesses, black Americans, and restaurant workers."

The mega-donor brothers are known for their regular backing of conservative causes, donating millions of dollars to back GOP candidates, but NPR reports that the LIBRE Initiative is putting money behind praising Democrats who have shown a willingness to work on finding a legislative fix for DACA while also backing stronger border security initiatives.
LIBRE is an outreach of the Koch network that focuses on a number of issues for the Hispanic community.

""This stands out. People when they talk about the Koch network ... they point at areas like tax reform, where we've worked very closely with Republican members,"" Wadi Gaitan, a spokesman for LIBRE, told NPR.
""Here on this issue, we have Democrats where we want to make sure that their constituents are aware that they are working on a permanent solution for Dreamers and on border security,"" he added. ""So it certainly is a unique effort.""

""Thank you Sen. Coons for supporting a permanent solution for Dreamers,"" it adds.
Not all the ads are directed at Democrats. Six GOP House lawmakers and three Republican senators will receive praise from the group, NPR reports.
The LIBRE network told NPR that the project was part of a ""seven-figure"" spending effort by the Koch Network aimed at finding a permanent fix for the ""Dreamer"" issue. According to Gaitan, ads will target TV and digital audiences while the group also branches out into congressional advocacy, including working with more Democrats.
""In order to get this through the House and Senate, it is important for Democrats to be at the table ... for us, it's how do we achieve the goal?"" Gaitan said. ""And what we said is we're willing to work with whoever to make sure that we're getting good policy through Congress.""
The Trump administration announced last year that it would end the Obama-era DACA program that granted protected status to immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children, sometimes called Dreamers.
Congress originally hoped to pass a permanent legislative fix for the nearly 2 million immigrants affected by the decision before March 5, when the first protections began to end, but were unable to come to an agreement.
Since the decision last year, several federal courts have ruled that the Trump administration must maintain the Obama-era program, and this week a California-based federal appeals court appeared unlikely to toss out a lower court ruling forcing the program to be maintained.
In March, the Supreme Court rejected a request from the Trump administration to take up the case, leaving the ruling for a lower court.

Earlier, the migrants marched from Friendship Park in Tijuana, Mexico to the San Ysidro port of entry. They stood on the Mexican side; on the other side lay San Diego, California. It was the final leg for some in the caravan of hundreds of migrants, which had reached Tijuana on Tuesday.
Alex Mensing, an organizer with Pueblo Sin Fronteras, which assembled the caravan, said 50 migrants were admitted to the immigration processing center on the Mexico side. However, that is incorrect. The migrants congregated on a bridge leading to the US border while waiting to be processed by American officials.
Before the group arrived, US Customs and Border Protection officials said the port had already reached full capacity, and migrants trying to get into the United States may need to wait in Mexico as officials process those already in the facility.
Some migrants said they had walked the last leg of the journey filled with anxiety. Others scarfed down food before they filed into the center, afraid there would be no food once they turned themselves in to border officials."

The migrants are part of a caravan that has drawn the attention, and ire, of President Donald Trump. The president has said the group’s plan to ask for asylum is evidence that there is a crisis at the U.S. border with Mexico.

Last week, President Donald Trump vowed to “stop” the caravan, while Cabinet members said they would deliver a swift response. The asylum seekers held firm, setting up a possible showdown.
In an anticlimactic twist, about 50 asylum seekers were allowed past a gate controlled by Mexican officials to walk across a long bridge but were stopped at the entrance to the US inspection facility at the other end.

They were allowed to wait outside the building, technically on Mexican soil, without word of when US officials would let them claim asylum.
Another 50 or so camped on blankets and backpacks in Tijuana outside the Mexican side of the crossing, prohibited from even getting close to the US inspection building.
The asylum-seekers began the day with anticipation, travelling in red-and-white school buses under police escort to a beachfront rally in Tijuana, where a steel fence juts out into the Pacific Ocean.

They sang the Honduran national anthem, and supporters on the San Diego side of the fence waved a Honduran flag.
After a final briefing from lawyers, and minutes before they were to begin a short walk to the border crossing, US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan announced that the San Ysidro border crossing, the nation’s busiest, had “reached capacity” for people without legal documents and that asylum-seekers may need to wait in Mexico temporarily.
Mr Trump has commented frequently on the caravan since it started in Mexico on March 25 near the Guatemala border and headed north to Tijuana.
His broadsides came as his administration vowed to end what officials call “legal loopholes” and “catch-and-release” policies that allow people requesting asylum to be released from custody into the US while their claims make their way through the courts, which can take years.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called the caravan “a deliberate attempt to undermine our laws and overwhelm our system”.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said asylum claims will be resolved “efficiently and expeditiously” and warned that anyone making false claims could be prosecuted.
The administration’s stern warnings left organisers in disbelief that border inspectors were not ready for them.
“They have been well aware that a caravan is going to arrive at the border,” Nicole Ramos, an attorney working on behalf of caravan members, said at a news conference.
“The failure to prepare and failure to get sufficient agents and resources is not the fault of the most vulnerable among us. We can build a base in Iraq in under a week. We can’t process 200 refugees. I don’t believe it.”

The San Ysidro border inspection facility can hold about 300 people, according to Pete Flores, Customs and Border Protection’s San Diego field office director, suggesting the bottleneck may be short-lived. The agency processed about 8,000 asylum cases from October to February, or about 50 a day.
Asylum-seekers are typically held for up to three days at the border and then turned over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. If they pass an asylum officer’s initial screening, they may be detained or released into the US with ankle monitors.
Asylum seekers did not appear to be thrown by the delay.
Wendi Yaneri Garcia said she was confident she will be released while her asylum case is pending because she is travelling alone with her two-year-old son, who has been sick.
She said police in her hometown of Atlantida, Honduras, jailed her for protesting construction of a hydroelectric plant and that she received death threats after being released.
“All I want is a place where I can work and raise my son,” the 36-year-old said.

Elin Orrellana, a 23-year-old pregnant woman from El Salvador, said she is fleeing the violent MS-13 street gang, a favourite target of both Mr Sessions and Mr Trump because of their brutal killings in communities in the US.
She said her older sister had been killed by the gang in El Salvador, so she is attempting to join other family members in the Kansas City area.
“Fighting on is worth it,” she said as she camped out for chilly night outside the border crossing."

U.S. District Court Judge John Bates, the third federal judge and the first Republican appointee to rule against Trump administration attempts to kill DACA, wrote in a Tuesday opinion that the Department of Homeland Security has 90 days to provide him with a more compelling reason for rolling back the Obama-era program, otherwise he could order its restoration.
“DACA’s rescission was arbitrary and capricious because the Department failed adequately to explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful,” Bates wrote.
""Neither the meager legal reasoning nor the assessment of litigation risk provided by DHS to support its rescission decision is sufficient to sustain termination of the DACA program,"" he continued.
A Justice Department spokesman told Politico DOJ would continue to ""vigorously defend"" its position.

5235,Another Federal Judge Rules Against Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Order To Cancel DACA',HuffPost,4/25/2018,,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/judge-rules-against-canceling-daca_us_5adfd19ce4b07560f3967230,"A third federal judge ruled on Tuesday against the Trump administration’s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
In September, President Donald Trump canceled the Obama-era DACA program, which shields undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as youths from deportation. But in a stinging rebuke of the Trump administration’s legal logic, U.S. District Judge John Bates described the program’s cancellation as “arbitrary and capricious because the Department [of Homeland Security] failed adequately to explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful.”
“Neither the meager legal reasoning nor the assessment of litigation risk provided by DHS to support its rescission decision is sufficient to sustain termination of the DACA program,” Bates wrote in the opinion.
The ruling has no immediate effect, and the decision to cancel DACA has already been stalled by a nationwide injunction. Bates’ ruling is unique, however, because it opens the possibility that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services might have to start accepting new DACA applications. The current injunctions only require the federal government to renew the applications of people who have already been approved for the program.
Bates gave the Department of Homeland Security another 90 days to give a better explanation for canceling the program before moving forward with the decision.
The consolidated lawsuits seeking to overturn the DACA cancellation in the District of Columbia were brought by several parties, including the NAACP, Microsoft, two labor unions, Princeton University and DACA recipient Maria de la Cruz Perales Sanchez.
Tuesday’s ruling adds another layer of complexity to the Trump administration’s efforts to squelch former President Barack Obama’s last standing immigration reform. Other lawsuits are moving through the federal court system in California and New York.
Both suits will likely drag on for months just to get through the discovery period, when lawyers demand to see the evidence that will appear as the case goes to trial. Plaintiffs in the California and New York cases are pressing the Trump administration to cough up more documents to shed light on its reasons for abruptly canceling DACA last fall, despite leaving the program in place for the first nine months after Trump took office.
The Justice Department has argued that many of the documents describing the decision-making process are privileged and not subject to disclosure to the court."

The directive does not, on its own, toughen immigration policy or take concrete steps to do so; it merely directs officials to report to the president about steps they are taking to “expeditiously end ‘catch and release’ practices.” But it is a symbolic move by Mr. Trump to use his executive action to solve a problem that he has bitterly complained Congress will not.
It also caps a week that began with the president offering tough talk on immigration and ended with his ordering the National Guard to patrol the southwestern border, a move formalized on Friday night when Defense Secretary Jim Mattis signed orders to deploy up to 4,000 troops.
“The safety and security of the American people is the president’s highest priority, and he will keep his promise to protect our country and to ensure that our laws are respected,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement announcing the memorandum."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on Friday ordering the end of a policy, known as “catch and release,” in which illegal immigrants are released from detention while awaiting a court hearing on their status.
As part of the memo, Trump asked Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to produce a list of military facilities that could be used to detain illegal immigrants."

He called for illegal immigrants nabbed at the border to be held in custody, to the fullest extent possible. He also ordered more asylum officers to head to detention centers so they can rule on cases faster, calculating that if they can clear the cases they can send undeserving migrants home without having to release them.
In a memo to his attorney general and secretaries of the State, Defense, Homeland and Health and Human Services departments, Mr. Trump also demanded regular updates on progress, and told them to submit requests for any new resources they need.
“The safety and security of the American people is the president’s highest priority, and he will keep his promise to protect our country and to ensure that our laws are respected,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.
Catch-and-release is the name Border Patrol agents and others involved in the immigration debate have given to the practice of arresting illegal immigrants, processing them and then having to set them free in the U.S., with the order that they return for a deportation hearing some time in the future.
They disappear into the shadows and most never bother to show for their hearings, which can be years later.
The Bush administration had tried to end catch-and-release by speeding up deportations of Mexicans. But a shift in migration patterns, with a surge in people from Central America — particularly children and families — has caused the issue to raise its head again.
U.S. law, court cases and Obama administration decisions have made it much tougher to deport those people, with a host of legal protections built up around them pushing for them to be released from custody if their cases can’t be cleared quickly.
Earlier Friday Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered prosecutors along the southwest border to bring criminal misdemeanor charges against people who jump the border.
Mr. Trump’s new memo calls on Mr. Sessions and the other departments to crack down on abuse of the asylum system, after illegal immigrants have learned how to game the system by using “magic words” indicating they fear being sent back home.
Before 2013, only about 1 percent of migrants showing up on the border claimed asylum. Now the number is higher than 10 percent, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said this week.
“Smugglers themselves are gaming the system, pure and simple. They take advantage of the loopholes in our laws. They know that we cannot prosecute as we need to to stop their behavior,” she said.

3949,"A BIG STEP': Trump says military will guard the US/Mexico border until wall can be built""",Fox News (Online),4/3/2018,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/04/03/trump-says-military-will-secure-southern-border-until-wall-can-be-built.html,"President Trump on Tuesday said that the U.S. will secure the southern border with the military until a wall can be built, calling the move a “big step.”
Trump made the remarks during a meeting with Baltic leaders, where he said he had discussed the matter with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. A White House official revealed later Tuesday to Fox News that the plan considered by Trump would be a “substantial” mobilization of the National Guard.
“Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military,” he said. “That's a big step, we really haven’t done that before, or certainly not very much before.”
At a news conference later, he confirmed the plan, saying the border is unprotected by “our horrible, horrible and very unsafe laws.”
“We don't have laws, we have catch-and-release,” he said. “You catch and then you immediately release and people come back years later for a court case, except they virtually never come back.”
Trump did not offer specifics, but the move appears to be at least partly motivated by a caravan of over 1,000 Central American migrants heading toward the U.S. border. Buzzfeed, which first reported on the caravan, said that Mexican officials had not yet attempted to stop the flow.
In Tuesday's discussion, Trump and senior officials “also agreed on the need to pressure Congress to urgently pass legislation to close legal loopholes exploited by criminal trafficking, narco-terrorist and smuggling organizations,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. She added that Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary Kirsten Nielsen, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford and Chief of Staff John Kelly were among the other officials present.
Reports of the caravan angered Trump, who has sent out a number of tweets threatening to end the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and to cut foreign aid to countries such as Honduras, from where many of the migrants originate.
“The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our “Weak Laws” Border, had better be stopped before it gets there,” he tweeted Tuesday. “Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!”
At the press conference he said that NAFTA was an “embarrasing” deal and that he had told Mexican officials on Monday: “I hope you're going to tell that caravan not to get up to the border.” He added that he thinks the caravan was being broken up as a result.
The Pentagon was scrambling to come up with a response to Trump's statement on the military guarding the border. But according to a memo obtained by Fox News and discussions with officials, one area where the Pentagon could contribute immediately is the Air Force’s Barry Goldwater live-fire range, which shares a 35-mile border with Mexico in southern Arizona.
The Defense Department is already offering some support to the border, including U.S. Navy ships patrolling waters to seize drugs as well as missions involving over 100 personnel from U.S. military’s northern command -- including eight planes and a drone -- to help border patrol.
In 2010, President Obama authorized 1,200 National Guard troops to increase security at the border, although Republican lawmakers questioned their role and whether they would in fact be “boots on the ground.""
Trump has struggled to secure funding for his central campaign promise of a wall, which the administration and border officials say will cost approximately $20-25 billion. In the omnibus bill signed by Trump last month, $1.6 billion was included for technology and some replacement of existing border fencing -- although it excluded the prototypes Trump recently viewed in California.
Trump briefly considered vetoing the legislation both over its lack of funding for the wall and also the failure to include a fix for the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that granted protection for illegal immigrants brought to the country as children. He has since floated the idea of getting the Pentagon to fund the wall.
Brandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol Council, said on Fox News Radio’s “The Todd Starnes Show” that it gives Border Patrol “certainty of apprehension.”
“The criminal smugglers, this is a multibillion dollar industry. They smuggle humans, they smuggle drugs,” he said. “This criminal enterprise, if we arrest the majority of people that cross the border illegally, we put a dent into their criminal enterprise, and if you put a dent into their criminal enterprise, then you can possibly stop them.”

4630,Trump: deploy military at U.S.-Mexico border until wall built',Reuters,4/3/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-trump/trump-deploy-military-at-u-s-mexico-border-until-wall-built-idUSKCN1HA1KP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s strategy for the U.S.-Mexico border includes mobilizing the National Guard, the White House said on Tuesday, after Trump had earlier spoken publicly to reporters about “guarding our border with the military” to stop illegal immigrants.

The White House statement was released after Trump met with Defense Secretary James Mattis, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other officials on border issues. It gave no details on whether or when Trump’s strategy might be implemented.
The National Guard, part of the U.S. military’s reserve forces, has been used in recent years for surveillance and intelligence on the border, but not direct law enforcement.
The president’s earlier remarks sharpened his recurring anti-immigration rhetoric. He said he wanted to deploy U.S. military forces until his long-promised border wall is built.
“Until we can have a wall and proper security we’re going to be guarding our border with the military,” Trump told reporters at the White House, lamenting what he called “horrible” U.S. laws that left the southern border poorly protected.
Trump railed against a “caravan” of Central American migrants traveling from the Mexico-Guatemala border in the last 10 days toward the United States, journeys that have occurred annually since 2010 in an effort to draw attention to the plight of people fleeing violence in their countries.
On Tuesday night, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said on Twitter that the caravan “dispersed gradually and at the decision of its participants.” Mexican officials say privately that they believe Trump has exaggerated the caravan’s importance to renew pressure on Mexico over the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
After 14 months in office, Trump still hammers regularly on an anti-immigration theme that helped to energize conservative Republican voters who helped him win the presidency in the 2016 election. Trump took a hard line on illegal immigration during the campaign and has also sought to curtail legal immigration.
His efforts have thus far failed to produce a comprehensive overhaul of America’s immigration laws or full funding for his border wall in the Republican-led Congress. No major legislation was expected before November’s congressional elections.
LEGAL QUESTIONS RAISED
His latest comments immediately raised questions in Congress and among legal experts about troop deployments on U.S. soil.
The Posse Comitatus Act, a federal law on the books since the 1870s, restricts using the U.S. Army and other main branches of the military for civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil, unless specifically authorized by Congress.
But the military can provide support services to law enforcement and has done so on occasion since the 1980s.
Under Republican President George W. Bush, the National Guard between 2006 and 2008 provided border-related intelligence analysis, but had no direct law enforcement role.
In 2010, President Barack Obama sent National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexican border to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support to U.S. Border Patrol agents.
Some specific statutes authorize the president to deploy troops within the United States for riot control or relief efforts after natural disasters.
“The details really matter here,” said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law.
“The real question is going to be if the president is serious about this, what kind of legal arguments do we get out of the White House and the Pentagon for such a deployment.”
A senior Republican aide in the U.S. House of Representatives said key lawmakers had not been briefed on the White House plan. The aide said there was no indication that a specific plan had even been formulated yet.
Geronimo Gutierrez, Mexico’s ambassador in Washington, said he had spoken to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen about Trump’s remarks on the border and that Mexico had formally asked the U.S. government to clarify them.
“It’s certainly not something that the Mexican government welcomes,” Gutierrez told CNN.
Nielsen, who took part in the meeting with Trump, said in a Twitter message late on Tuesday that she had been told by Mexican officials “the caravan is dissipating.”
In southern Mexico, officials screened the dwindling number of hundreds of largely Central American migrants on Tuesday.
At a campaign rally, Mexican leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is leading most polls by double digits before the July 1 presidential election, said that if the U.S. government militarizes the border, thousands of his supporters would protest by forming a “big human chain of Mexicans for peace.”
Some members of Congress said they were uncomfortable with the idea of using the military at the border.
Democratic Senator Brian Schatz said Trump should have to seek approval from Congress for any such troop deployment. “We should put that new law to a vote in the Senate,” he said on Twitter. “I predict fewer than 20 votes.”
In a Twitter post earlier on Tuesday, Trump said the caravan “heading to our ‘Weak Laws’ Border, had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!” Congress is on vacation until next week."
6383,"Trump\xe2\x80\x99s call to guard \xe2\x80\x9cour border with our military,\xe2\x80\x9d explained'",Vox,4/3/2018,,,https://www.vox.com/2018/4/3/17193490/trump-wall-border-military-explained,"President Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday that his administration is “going to be guarding our border with our military,” reaffirming the White House’s intent to circumvent Congress’s spending bill and beef up border security.
After Congress’s $1.3 trillion spending bill largely ignored Trump’s immigration priorities, the president, who begrudgingly signed the funding package in late March, has called on his administration to find ways to fund the border wall anyway. Trump said he spoke with Defense Secretary James Mattis about the idea last week, but it’s still not clear what directives — if any — the president has given.
One idea, reportedly pushed by White House adviser Stephen Miller, is to send the National Guard down to the border, according to Just Security’s Kate Brannen. Trump certainly wouldn’t be the first president to call on the National Guard to help enforce the border (both Barack Obama and George W. Bush did the same). But it comes with legal constraints and could cost millions with little in returns, something Obama was criticized for.
There are a lot of legal limitations to using Pentagon money for the border across the board. While Congress’s government funding package allocated $700 billion for defense spending, it’s not a blank check to the Pentagon, and the money is appropriated to specific programs. Deviating from those regulations could be illegal.
Of course, there are some workarounds, but they have the potential to be very politically fraught — and likely pretty ineffective on the border. Trump, however, seems fixated on the idea.
Trump could use the military’s money on the border. His options are limited.
Currently, Congress has allocated $1.6 billion for the border wall through the Department of Homeland Security, with specific instructions that those funds had to go toward repairing existing fencing or toward double fencing where barriers already exist. In other words, Trump’s “big, beautiful” wall did not get funding.
On enforcement, Republicans, who went into the spending fight wanting more funding for the Department of Homeland Security to increase the number of beds for immigrant detainees and to expand the enforcement force, settled for more modest spending measures. The final compromise included funding for only an additional 328 Customs and Border Protection officers, and ICE will actually have to reduce the number of detention beds. Needless to say, this isn’t the kind of deportation force Trump’s administration was envisioning.
But Trump’s call to redirect money from the military toward the border is fraught. Of course, because it’s the legislative branch’s constitutional right to allocate government funding (and it’s illegal to use federal funds for anything other than what Congress appropriates it for), Trump is legally limited.
Like Obama and Bush, he could call on the National Guard to go down to the border. But if that directive comes from the federal government, the guards legally can’t act as law enforcement. The Posse Comitatus Act forbids using the military in civilian law enforcement. It leaves Trump two options: have states send down their guards, which means states would have to foot the bill, or have guards on the border in non-law enforcement roles.
For example in 2010, when Obama deployed 1,200 National Guard troops to the border, they fixed infrastructure, worked on surveillance, and processed arrests — similar to Bush’s 2006’s Operation Jump Start. But even this was very expensive and was largely criticized for being ineffective.
“Critics of the deployment include budget hawks, who say it is a waste of money, and residents here along the border, who say they are tired of seeing armed troops in their back yard,” the Washington Post reported at the time. “The 1,200 National Guard troops have helped Border Patrol agents apprehend 25,514 illegal immigrants at a cost of $160 million — or $6,271 for each person caught.”
Another option is to tap into the emergency military construction funding known as MILCON. Up to $50 million can be used without congressional approval in cases of national security or to protect US military officers. As Brannen writes, “using MILCON funding is also guaranteed to make members of Congress particularly angry, because it would be the military construction projects in their districts that would be directly losing money to the wall.”
Not to mention that $50 million won’t get Trump much mileage on the border. For context, Congress appropriated $445 million for 25 miles of levee fencing in the Rio Grande Valley and $251 million to replace 14 miles of existing secondary fencing in the San Diego sector.
Trump told reporters Tuesday that using the military on the border would be a “big step” toward achieving his border security agenda.
But reality paints a very different picture."
2048,"Caravan of 1,000 Illegal Aliens Forces Trump to Talk Tougher With Mexico'",Townhall,4/2/2018,,,https://townhall.com/tipsheet/timothymeads/2018/04/01/caravan-of-1000-illegal-aliens-forces-trump-to-talk-tougher-with-mexico-n2466766,"Could a recent Buzzfeed news story force America to get even tougher with Mexico due to illegal immigration? Based on President Trump's tweets today, that answer is yes.
On Friday March 30th, BuzzFeed's Adolfo Flores documented shocking photos of more than 1,000 migrants from Central America marching through the streets Mexico on their way to the United States border. While the fact that migrants come through Mexico was not unsurprising, the sheer mass of people and the blatant unwillingness of Mexico's immigration agents to even bother with the problem was truly dismaying.
From BuzzFeed: Taking a drag from her cigarette, a Mexican immigration agent looked out toward a caravan of migrants that grew larger with each step they took on the two-lane highway. When the agent, who'd covered her uniform with an orange and white shawl, learned that the Central American migrants heading her way numbered more than 1,000, she took off for the restaurant across the street. “I'm going to have a relaxing Coke,” she told BuzzFeed News. For five days now hundreds of Central Americans — children, women, and men, most of them from Honduras — have boldly crossed immigration checkpoints, military bases, and police in a desperate, sometimes chaotic march toward the United States. Despite their being in Mexico without authorization, no one has made any effort to stop them. Organized by a group of volunteers called Pueblos Sin Fronteras, or People Without Borders, the caravan is intended to help migrants safely reach the United States, bypassing not only authorities who would seek to deport them, but gangs and cartels who are known to assault vulnerable migrants. Organizers like Rodrigo Abeja hope that the sheer size of the crowd will give immigration authorities and criminals pause before trying to stop them. “If we all protect each other we'll get through this together,” Abeja yelled through a loudspeaker on the morning they left Tapachula, on Mexico's border with Guatemala, for the nearly monthlong trek. When they get to the US, they hope American authorities will grant them asylum or, for some, be absent when they attempt to cross the border illegally. More likely is that it will set up an enormous challenge to the Trump administration's immigration policies and its ability to deal with an organized group of migrants numbering in the hundreds. The number of people who showed up to travel with the caravan caught organizers by surprise, and has overwhelmed the various towns they've stopped in to spend the night. Pueblos Sin Fronteras counted about 1,200 people on the first day. About 80% of them are from Honduras. Many said they are fleeing poverty, but also political unrest and violence that followed the swearing in of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández after a highly contested election last year. The group often breaks into chants of “out with JOH.” They also chant “we aren't immigrants, we're international workers” and “the people united will never be defeated.”
Apparently, this type of commute is the preferred method of illegal aliens because it guarantees safety in numbers.
Before setting out on the journey, the migrants were organized into groups of 10 to 15 people, and a leader was designated for each group. Five groups were then banded together in what organizers call a sector. While there are organizers from Pueblos Sin Fronteras leading the way, much of the effort to get to the US border is in the hands of the migrants themselves. They've been organized into security, food, and logistics committees. Organizers say it's meant to help the migrants empower themselves. Sandra Perez, 40, who's also from Honduras, is one of two women who belong to the security committee. It's not her first caravan: She has traveled with a procession of Central American mothers through Mexico in search of disappeared migrants. “I like doing this, it makes me happy and I feel useful,” she told BuzzFeed News. Not everyone is planning on crossing into the United States undetected. Migrants like Yonis, an Honduran man who declined to use his full name, are hoping to get their families to other parts of Mexico. He was able to legalize his status in Mexico and is hoping to get his wife and seven month old baby to the Mexican state Nuevo León. ""I have my life there,"" Yonis told BuzzFeed News. ""We're all here fighting together, going to different borders, chasing an American dream that sometimes becomes a reality or doesn't for some."" Organizers estimate that about two-thirds of people are planing on crossing into the United States undetected or asking for some type of protection like asylum. Twenty-nine-year-old Mateo Juan said the caravan was his third attempt at getting to the United States. Seven months ago, Mexican immigration officers pulled him off the bus. The same happened about a month ago. He heard about the caravan in March when he arrived in Tapachula, the caravan's starting point. “Going alone is risky. You're risking an accident, getting jumped by robbers, and even your life,” he told BuzzFeed News. “All of that, and then you don't get to the United States. The caravan is slower but you know you're going to get there safely.”
This led President Trump to tweet on Easter Sunday that America will finally have to deal with Mexico's ""cash cow"" - the North American Free Trade Agreement - if their government does not help prevent illegal immigration in to the United States.

This article is more than 2 years old
The Mexican government has stopped a caravan of Central American migrants trying to reach the Mexico-US border as their presence in the country brought blistering attacks from the US president, Donald Trump.
In a statement issued on Monday night, the interior ministry and foreign relations ministry said the migrants had improperly entered the country and would be subject to administrative procedures.
“Under no circumstances does the government of Mexico promote irregular migration,” the statement said.
Approximately 400 caravan participants have already been removed from the country, according to the government.
Adolfo Flores, a BuzzFeed journalist covering the caravan, reported some of the migrants, such pregnant women and those with disabilities or chronic conditions, might be issued humanitarian visas. Everyone would have 10 days to leave the country or they could request a 30-day stay, during which time they could request permission to remain.
Organisers expected some of the participants to continue travelling north, though some would likely apply for asylum in Mexico.
Trump returned to the offensive on immigration on Monday, when he repeated a claim that “caravans” of migrants from Central America are threatening to enter the US via Mexico. He also demanded: “Act now Congress, our country is being stolen!”
“Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large ‘Caravans’ of people enter their country,” the president tweeted. “They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws.
“Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the weak Dem laws don’t allow them to do their job. Act now Congress, our country is being stolen!”
Trump’s use of the term “caravans” – also made in a sequence of tweets on Easter Sunday – had been reported on by Fox News, Trump’s preferred cable network.
The “nuclear option” he referred to would be a reform of Senate rules to allow major legislation to pass with 51 votes rather than the current 60. The Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has shown no sign of acceding to Trump’s repeated demand.
Mexico’s interior minister, Alfonso Navarete Prida, told reporters on Monday: “It is absolutely incorrect to say that there is no effort in Mexico to regulate, support and mange migratory processes.”

Upon announcing his presidential bid Donald Trump makes hardline immigration reform central to his campaign and pledges to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca). “I will immediately terminate President Obama’s illegal executive order on immigration,” he says. Weeks after winning the White House, ​​President-elect Trump appears to soften his stance on Dreamers. Despite offering no specific policy he promises to “work something out”. “On a humanitarian basis it’s a very tough situation.” he tells T​​ime magazine. Trump acknowledges the fraught road to a solution, describing Daca as a “very difficult thing for me as I love these kids”. “I have to deal with a lot of politicians,” Trump says. “And I have to convince them that what I’m saying is right.” Trump abruptly announces ​​he will end Daca, phasing out applications for renewal by March 2018. ​​The president insists the decision provides a “window of opportunity for Congress to finally act”. Following talks with Democrats, Trump hints a deal may be close, but suggests it wouldn’t include a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers. “We’re not looking at citizenship. We’re not looking at amnesty,” Trump tells reporters. Trump promises to “take the heat” for a bipartisan Daca bill being brokered by senators. But within days he revokes his support, calling the bipartisan plan “a big step backwards”.​ The US government shuts down after negotiations over the budget and a Dreamers solution collapse. On the same day a district judge rules the administration must keep the program open to new applications, a ruling that is later supported by other federal court decisions. With the government reopened with a temporary bill, Trump tells reporters he is now open to a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers “over a period of 10-12 years” if the individual “does a great job, they work hard​”. Trump appears to end the possibility of a bipartisan deal over Daca with a series of furious tweets on Easter Sunday. He blames Democrats and declares: ""NO MORE DACA DEAL!"" Oliver Laughland
Organisers said some 1,300 people were participating in the caravan. Mexican immigration officials routinely detain and deport hundreds of thousands of Central Americans, who in recent years have streamed north to escape horrific violence in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Mexico deported 16,278 individuals in the first two months of 2018 – 97% of them were Central Americans.
The migrants’ paths through Mexico are perilous. Criminal gangs, often acting in cahoots with crooked public officials, prey upon migrants, often extorting them or kidnapping them for ransom.
Shelters run the length of the country, offering migrants a place to eat, rest and wash and tend to their wounds as they head north. The operators of these shelters expressed wariness with the caravan currently winding its way through southern Mexico, saying such attempts at moving migrants through Mexico often turn into targets for criminal groups.
Jorge Andrade, a spokesman for the shelters, says “polleros” – human smugglers – and other organised crime members have infiltrated previous caravans. People pretending to be migrants, meanwhile, joined in and started extorting actual migrants.
“It’s a real logistical challenge, in addition to security questions,” Andrade said. During a 2014 caravan that Andrade accompanied, “we realised that we had been infiltrated by people from organised crime, whom we could identify.”
Many of the participants in caravans inevitably are offered humanitarian visas, which allow them to temporarily remain in Mexico, or they file asylum applications.
Alex Mensing, project coordinator for Pueblos Sin Fronteras, which was accompanying the caravan, says the shelters in Mexico “do important work and caravan members have benefited from their services”. He added that migrants participating in the caravan would receive legal advice upon reaching the city of Puebla and some would likely seek asylum in Mexico.
“The people in the caravan are much, much less vulnerable to human rights abuses,” Mensing said.
On Monday, Trump widened his attack, tweeting: “DACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon … No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!”
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or Daca, was an Obama-era programme that shielded undocumented migrants brought to the US as children, known as Dreamers, from the threat of deportation.
“The [Trump] attack on Daca was designed to pit Central Americans against Mexicans and to put immigrants in the United States against immigrants who are trying to exercise their right to seek asylum in the the United States,” Mensing said.
Trump announced the cancellation of Daca last year. No replacement has been instituted but court orders have maintained protections for recipients.
Trump claimed on Sunday that “a lot of people are coming in because they want to take advantage of Daca, and we’re going to have to really see”.
In fact, to be eligible for Daca, applicants must have lived in the US continually since 15 June 2007 and come to the country before their 16th birthday. Applicants must also either be in school, or have graduated high school, or have been honourably discharged from the US military or coast guard.
Trump’s decision to quash any remaining hopes of a Daca deal drew criticism on Sunday. John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio who is seen as a possible primary challenger to Trump in 2020, tweeted: “A true leader preserves & offers hope, doesn’t take hope from innocent children who call America home. Remember, today is Easter Sunday.”
Trump rejected one deal with Democrats that would have funded a border wall, which he promised throughout his campaign for the White House would be paid for by Mexico. He has recently suggested the military could pay for the wall, a prospect experts said was extremely unlikely.

Later on Monday, Trump returned to the North American Free Trade Agreement, a favourite target which in his Sunday tweets he had threatened to “stop”. “Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA,” he wrote, adding: “With all of the money they make from the US, hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!”
Polls in Mexico show people south of the border support Nafta, but don’t see themselves as big winners from the trade deal, which also includes Canada.
Regarding possible motives for Trump’s latest outburst, which also took in Amazon, NBC and CNN, news outlets reported White House sources as saying Trump has been told his base thinks he has softened on immigration.
The president has also been beset by damaging stories, from developments in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian election interference and alleged collusion between Trump aides and Moscow, to adult film actor Stormy Daniels’ claim that she had an affair with the billionaire in 2006.
Controversies over ethics and spending are affecting members of the Trump administration, including the housing and urban development secretary, Ben Carson, and the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt.
On Sunday the former Veterans Affairs secretary David Shulkin told network television he was fired last week, rather than resigning as the White House claimed. Shulkin, who opposed the privatisation of VA operations, blamed political appointees for his downfall."

6034,Sessions Targets California Immigrants Using a Ruling That Protected Them',New York Times (Online News),3/9/2018,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/us/politics/jeff-sessions-california-lawsuit.html,"WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions sued California this week for not doing enough to find and punish unauthorized immigrants, and said on Wednesday he was girding for an epic battle.
“California is using every power it has — and some it doesn’t — to frustrate federal law enforcement,” he said in a speech in Sacramento. “So you can be sure I’m going to use every power I have to stop them.”
One of the weapons Mr. Sessions is counting on is a 2012 Supreme Court ruling siding with the Obama administration, which had sued Arizona for violating federal immigration laws. But in that case Mr. Obama’s lawyers accused the state of going too far in trying to find and punish unauthorized immigrants.

6283,"U.S. Justice Department sues California over 'sanctuary' policies""",Reuters,3/9/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-justice-immigration/u-s-justice-department-sues-california-over-sanctuary-policies-idUSKCN1GJ07T,"WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department sued the state of California over so-called “sanctuary” policies that try to protect illegal immigrants against deportation, ramping up a confrontation over whether local police should enforce federal law.
The lawsuit, filed late Tuesday in federal court in Sacramento, the California state capital, takes aim at three state laws passed last year that the Justice Department contends violate the U.S. Constitution.
The issue of illegal immigrants has become increasingly heated since Donald Trump became president last year and signaled that he planned to target a wider swath of people for deportation.
Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has made combating illegal immigration one of his top priorities since taking over the helm of the Justice Department in February 2017. A key part of that effort involves a crackdown on primarily Democrat-governed cities and states that Sessions claims are “sanctuaries” that protect illegal immigrants from deportation.
Sessions is expected to discuss the lawsuit during a speech on Wednesday morning in Sacramento. The Justice Department lawsuit cites a provision of the U.S. Constitution known as the “Supremacy Clause,” under which federal laws trump state laws.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra on Tuesday said law enforcement in the state is focused on public safety, not deportation. The Trump administration’s legal arguments are similar to those it has made in other cases, he said, and his office is prepared to address them.
“We’ve seen this ‘B’ rated movie before,” Becerra said on a call with reporters.
Brown in October signed into law a bill that prevents police from inquiring about immigration status and curtails law enforcement cooperation with immigration officers.

“The Department of Justice and the Trump administration are going to fight these unjust, unfair and unconstitutional policies that have been imposed on you,” Sessions plans to tell a group of law enforcement officers on Wednesday, according to prepared remarks seen by Reuters.
Early into his tenure, Trump signed an executive order that sought to block municipalities that failed to cooperate with U.S. immigration authorities from receiving federal grant funding.
However, the Justice Department’s attempts to implement the order to date have been stymied by lawsuits in the federal courts in Chicago, San Francisco and Philadelphia.
At issue is whether sanctuary cities are violating a federal law that requires them to share information about people they arrest with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.
One case is now on appeal, after a federal judge in San Francisco blocked Trump’s executive order to block funding to sanctuary cities.
Similar kinds of cases are under way in other parts of the country, including a case on appeal in Chicago after a federal judge issued a nationwide injunction barring the government from blocking grant money typically used to help local police combat violent crime and help victims.
The Justice Department’s lawsuit on Tuesday against California targets three state laws. One of them, known as Assembly Bill 450, prohibits private employers in California from voluntarily cooperating with federal immigration officials.
A second law, Senate Bill 54, prevents state and local law enforcement from giving federal immigration officials information about when they intend to release an illegal immigrant from their custody.

The third law empowers the state to inspect federal immigration detention centers.
The Justice Department filing says all three laws improperly attempt to regulate federal immigration at the state level. The department also plans to seek a court order from a judge to temporarily block the state from enforcing the laws."

Speaking to California police and sheriffs, Mr. Sessions defended his decision to file a lawsuit against California this week seeking to block three state laws he says are thwarting federal agents’ ability to stop illegal immigration.
And he took specific aim at Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, saying she actively aided illegal immigrants in escaping arrest last month by warning them of an impending sweep by federal deportation officers.
“Here’s my message to Mayor Schaaf: How dare you,” the attorney general said. “How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of law enforcement to promote a radical open borders agenda.”
Ms. Schaaf has defended her actions, saying she was trying to give illegal immigrants the tools to defend their rights, and saying she wanted to keep families together.
She won praise from state officials, who said California is proud to be a sanctuary.
The state government approved three laws last year that severely limit cooperation police can provide to federal immigration authorities, and also prohibit private businesses from cooperating as well.
Mr. Sessions said those laws interfere with the federal government, which under the Constitution and laws passed by Congress has supreme power over immigration.
“There is no nullification. There is no secession,” he said. “Federal law is ‘the supreme law of the land.’ I would invite any doubters to go to Gettysburg, to the tombstones of John C. Calhoun and Abraham Lincoln. This matter has been settled.”
Mr. Sessions called the laws “an embarrassment” to the state.
He wondered what would happen if a state passed a law to thwart the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to target polluters.
California officials have defended their policies, saying federal agents are allowed to conduct enforcement — but state and local police shouldn’t be forced to assist.
They argue that immigrants, including those in the country legally, are less willing to cooperate on reporting other crimes if they fear immigration agents could become involved.

4995,Second U.S. judge blocks Trump administration from ending DACA program',Reuters,2/14/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-ruling/second-u-s-judge-blocks-trump-administration-from-ending-daca-program-idUSKCN1FX2TJ,"FILE PHOTO - People protest for immigration reform for DACA recipients and a new Dream Act, in Los Angeles, California, U.S. January 22, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson
(Reuters) - A second U.S. judge on Tuesday blocked President Donald Trump’s decision to end a program that protects immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children from deportation.
U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn ruled that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, cannot end in March as the Republican administration had planned, a victory for Democratic state attorneys general and immigrants who sued the federal government.
The decision is similar to a Jan. 9 ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco that DACA must remain in place while litigation challenging Trump’s decision continues.
The legal battle over DACA complicates a debate currently underway in Congress on whether to change the nation’s immigration laws.
The Supreme Court on Friday is due to consider whether to take up the administration’s appeal of the San Francisco ruling. The court could announce as soon as Friday afternoon whether it will hearing the case.
Garaufis said the administration could eventually rescind the DACA program but that the reasons it gave last September for rescinding it were too arbitrary and could not stand. The judge ordered the administration to process DACA renewal applications on the same terms as had been in place before the president took his action.
In a statement, U.S. Justice Department spokesman Devin O’Malley said DACA was implemented unilaterally by Trump’s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama and thus unlawfully circumvented Congress.
“The Justice Department will continue to vigorously defend this position, and looks forward to vindicating its position in further litigation,” O’Malley said.
Often called “Dreamers,” hundreds of thousands of young adults, mostly Hispanics, have been granted protection from deportation and given work permits under DACA, which was created in 2012."
2113,Second Judge Blocks Trump Decision To End Deportation Relief For Dreamers',HuffPost,2/14/2018,,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daca-dreamers-second-judge-injunction_us_5a8366a4e4b02b66c51301c5,"Lucy Nicholson / Reuters DACA recipients and their supporters call for renewal of the program outside Disneyland in Anaheim, California, on Jan. 22, 2018.
A second federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump’s decision to cancel the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, dealing another blow to the president’s efforts to end protections for nearly 700,000 undocumented young people who came to the U.S. as children.
The nationwide preliminary injunction issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn mirrors a separate ruling handed down last month in California. Because the cancellation of DACA has already been halted, Garaufis’ order won’t have any immediate effect on Dreamers.
But the second injunction marks a win for Trump’s opponents, who have used the courts to defend DACA, even as the White House has sought to use the March 5 deadline set by the president as leverage to win concessions on border security from Democrats in Congress.
It could also complicate Trump’s own efforts in the courts. His administration has asked the Supreme Court to take the unusual step of overturning the first injunction, issued by U.S. District Judge William Alsup, now instead of letting it go through the normal appeals process.
The Supreme Court could decide as soon as Friday whether it will hear the administration’s request ― unless the new injunction delays that process. As of Tuesday, the justices were only scheduled to consider a request to overturn the injunction in the consolidated case out of California, according to Karen Tumlin, legal director for the National Immigration Law Center, one of the groups suing the administration over DACA.
Trump declared he would rescind DACA in September, claiming it was unconstitutional. The White House aimed to terminate the program in phases, allowing recipients whose work permits and deportation protections would expire by March 5 to apply for renewal during a four-week window, but barring all new applicants. The plan was that Dreamers whose permits were set to expire after March 5 would be unable to apply for renewal, creating that deadline for Congress to act before an estimated 1,000 people per day began losing protections.
Under the injunctions, however, those who have been approved for DACA are eligible to keep renewing it until the courts decide otherwise.
Because President Barack Obama created the program by executive action, Trump has the authority to scrap it. But the consolidated New York lawsuit ― which combines a case originally filed on behalf of DACA recipient Martín Jonathan Batalla Vidal with a suit filed by attorneys general from 15 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia ― argues that the administration violated DACA recipients’ due process rights and the terms of the Administrative Procedure Act when changing the policy. The APA requires federal officials to offer a reasonable justification before changing a major policy.
The Trump administration’s claim that the program is unconstitutional isn’t likely to stand up in court, according to Garaufis’ order. Trump’s decision to end DACA appears instead to be “arbitrary and capricious” and “an abuse of discretion,” the judge wrote.
“The question before the court is thus not whether Defendants could end the DACA program, but whether they offered legally adequate reasons for doing so,” the order says. “Based on its review of the record before it, the court concludes that Defendants have not done so.”
In a statement, Justice Department spokesman Devin O’Malley responded, “Today’s order doesn’t change the Department of Justice’s position on the facts: DACA was implemented unilaterally after Congress declined to extend these benefits to this same group of illegal aliens.”
The judge did not weigh in on the plaintiffs’ argument that Trump violated the Constitution by discriminating against DACA recipients based on animus toward Latinos. Nearly 80 percent of DACA recipients are originally from Mexico, a country the president has accused of sending rapists and other criminals into the U.S.
These injunctions are just a stop-gap solution for DACA recipients. Although they can still apply for renewal, it can take months for permits to be reviewed and approved, and many people’s protections are likely to lapse in the meantime. And, of course, the Trump administration is fighting to overturn the rulings and go back to rejecting applicants.
The president has said he wants to help young undocumented immigrants ― and maybe even grant them a pathway to citizenship ― but only if Democrats agree to fund his southern border wall, detain and deport more children and others at the border, and restrict legal immigration. His framework for a deal is considered dead on arrival in Congress because of heavy opposition from Democrats and some Republicans to slashing legal immigration, but the president hasn’t budged."
4813,Federal Judge Temporarily Blocks Trump Efforts to End DACA Program',Washington Free Beacon,2/14/2018,,,http://freebeacon.com/issues/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-trump-efforts-to-end-daca-program/,"A federal judge ruled Tuesday that DACA participants are likely to succeed in their challenge to President Donald Trump's ending of the program, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from ending it.
This ruling by Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District Court of New York, combined with a ruling from a California judge in January, means the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program could end past its planned March 5 date, CNN reports.
The judge said the decision to end the program was based on the ""plainly incorrect factual premise"" that the program was illegal.
""The question before the court is thus not whether defendants could end the DACA program, but whether they offered legally adequate reasons for doing so,"" wrote Judge Garaufis, a Clinton appointee to the court, according to the Washington Times.
""Based on its review of the record before it, the court concludes that defendants have not done so,"" he said.

6032,"2 senators offer bipartisan bill protecting young immigrants, but Trump quickly rejects it'",PBS NewsHour,2/5/2018,,,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/2-senators-offer-new-bipartisan-bill-protecting-young-immigrants,"WASHINGTON — A bipartisan immigration proposal has surfaced in the Senate, only to be quickly knocked down by President Donald Trump via Twitter on Monday.
Republican Sen. John McCain and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons planned to propose legislation Monday that would shield from deportation immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally as children, known as “Dreamers” helped by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. The bill also would strengthen border security, but it wouldn’t provide the $25 billion Trump wants for a U.S.-Mexico border wall.
But before the Senate had a chance to consider the narrow plan, Trump seemed to reject it on Twitter.
“Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal!” Trump tweeted.
Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2018
McCain, R-Ariz., and Coons, D-Del., said in a statement that their bill was designed to focus on two “pressing” border issues — the “Dreamers” and border security — so lawmakers could focus on completing a long-overdue budget deal.
The McCain-Coons plan is a more modest approach than Trump has sought for protecting the estimated 1.8 million young immigrants. The measure lacks Trump’s demands for limiting the relatives that “Dreamers” can sponsor for citizenship, and ending a visa lottery aimed at admitting more immigrants from diverse places including Africa.
The senators’ plan would create a road to legal status for “Dreamers” who arrived in the U.S. by the end of 2013 and meet other criteria, including no convictions for serious crimes. Once they’ve become lawful permanent residents, they can follow existing procedures to apply for citizenship.
Democrats and some Republicans want to give “Dreamers” a pathway to citizenship, but oppose cuts Trump would make in the number of legal immigrants allowed to enter the U.S. Conservatives oppose letting “Dreamers” become citizens. That stalemate has led many to believe the likeliest outcome is a narrowly focused bill or even no legislation at all.
The senators’ proposal is similar to a bipartisan House package by Reps. Will Hurd, R-Texas, and Pete Aguilar, D-Calif.

Sens. John McCain, R., Ariz. and Chris Coons, D., Del., plan to unveil a proposal that offers a path to citizenship for young immigrants known as “Dreamers” who have lived in the U.S. since Dec. 31, 2014, the Wall Street Journal reported. That is expected to be a larger group than would be covered by President Trump’s proposal to provide legal status to 1.8 million young immigrants.
“It’s time we end the gridlock so we can quickly move on to completing a long-term budget agreement that provides our men and women in uniform the support they deserve,” McCain said in a statement to the Journal.
McCain was part of a failed effort in 2013 known as the Gang of Eight that would have provided a path to citizenship for immigrants living in the country illegally.
“While reaching a deal cannot come soon enough for America’s service members, the current political reality demands bipartisan cooperation to address the impending expiration of the DACA program and secure the southern border,” he said, referring to former President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, that protected young immigrants from deportation and provided them work permits.
The bipartisan Senate bill also orders a comprehensive study to determine border-security measures to implement. It would provide a $110 million annual grant for five years to improve coordination between border-patrol agents and state and local law-enforcement officials.
It would call for hiring 55 new immigration court judges annually for three years, to clear a backlog of asylum cases. And it would order the State Department to provide a three-year strategy to help Central American countries address the causes of illegal immigration to the U.S., such as drug and gang violence.
The bill does not include some proposals preferred by Trump.
In exchange for protecting “Dreamers,” Trump wants funding for a border wall and changes to other parts of the immigration system, such as ending the visa lottery program and limiting family-based immigration.
The immigration debate is challenging Congress’ need to reach a long-term government funding deal.
Trump announced last year he would end the DACA program, and he gave Congress until March 5 to address the status of the immigrants.
Lawmakers are unlikely to reach an immigration deal before Feb. 8, when they must vote on another short-term government spending bill.
Parts of the government temporarily shut down last month because Democrats wanted a vote on an immigration deal to be tied to a government funding bill."
5648,"Report: DACA-age illegals far more likely to commit crimes, be in jail'",Washington Examiner,2/2/2018,,,http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/report-daca-age-illegals-far-more-likely-to-commit-crimes-be-in-jail/article/2645776,"A new report about crimes committed by illegals finds that younger undocumented immigrants who were eligible for former President Obama’s DACA amnesty program commit far more crimes than other immigrants or U.S. citizens.
In unearthing rare data that details the crimes and sentences of illegals in Arizona, the Crime Prevention Research Center reported that immigrants age 15-35, the general population of the 700,000 in Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, “commit crime at twice the rate of young U.S. citizens.”
The impact of illegal aliens on crime rates https://t.co/yivtkhQuax — CrimeResearch (@CrimeResearch1) January 12, 2018
John R. Lott Jr., president of the center, said that if the Arizona data were averaged out nationally, the crime numbers would be stunning.
“If undocumented immigrants committed crime nationally as they do in Arizona, in 2016 they would have been responsible for over 1,000 more murders, 5,200 rapes, 8,900 robberies, 25,300 aggravated assaults, and 26,900 burglaries,” he wrote in the report.
Proponents of letting DACA recipients stay in the United States, the topic of debate in the White House and on Capitol Hill, have often portrayed the illegals as law abiding students and workers.
Those claims however has come under fire by groups armed with new statistics like Lott’s treasure trove.
“Undocumented immigrants are at least 142 percent more likely to be convicted of a crime than other Arizonans. They also tend to commit more serious crimes and serve 10.5 percent longer sentences, more likely to be classified as dangerous, and 45 percent more likely to be gang members than U.S. citizens,” he found.
And it’s worse for DACA-aged illegals.
For example, he wrote, “while undocumented immigrants from 15 to 35 years of age make up about 0.81 percent of the Arizona population, they make up almost 8 percent of the prison population.”
According to his estimates in Arizona:
DACA-age immigrants represent 71.2 percent of the undocumented immigrants in prison.
DACA-age eligible undocumented immigrants are 884 percent more likely to be convicted of crimes than their share of the population.

2915,Restrictionists Are Misleading You About Immigrant Crime Rates',Reason,2/2/2018,,,http://reason.com/archives/2018/02/01/immigrants-and-crime,"President Donald Trump never misses an opportunity to depict unauthorized immigrants—especially of the Hispanic variety—as ""rapists and criminals."" He
did it again in his State of the Union address when he drew attention to two Long Island teenage girls killed by the El Salvadorian gang MS13. Those deaths are tragic, but they don't say much one way or the other about the propensity of these immigrants to commit crimes.
You wouldn't, however, know that from restrictionist pundits who are working overtime to sell the ""illegal immigrants are criminals"" narrative. A case in point is former US Civil Rights Commission member Peter Kirsanow's recent piece in National Review purporting to show that these immigrants are more likely to commit crimes than the native born. But Kirsanow uses incomplete and cherry-picked data—and makes rookie mistakes in interpreting it to boot—that eviscerate the credibility of his case.
Kirsanow is correct that most of the disagreements over the criminality of undocumented immigrants could be resolved by better data. But that doesn't absolve us from accurately reading the data we do have. Kirsanow, however, does not. His entire case is based on a gross misreading of the 2011 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), a federal program that partially reimburses states and localities for the cost of incarcerating certain criminal aliens.
The SCAAP report shows that in 2009, there were 295,959 criminal aliens incarcerated in state and local prisons at any given time that year. From this number, he subtracts those in the country legally and assumes that the balance gives one the total number of illegal immigrants incarcerated that year. He compares that number with the population of illegals in various states to estimate their crime rates. Then he compares that rate with the crime rate of citizens to come up with a massively inflated ""incarceration rate"" of these aliens.
But here's the problem with his analysis:
Kirsanow assumed, as some others before him with only a passing familiarity with these databases, that the 295,959 figure refers to the number of individuals incarcerated. In fact, it is the total number of incarcerations. In other words, if a criminal alien was incarcerated for 10 short sentences, released after each one, and then re-incarcerated, then that single alien would account for 10 incarcerations under the SCAAP figure for that year. But Kirsnaow counts that as 10 individuals.
However, when it comes to estimating the incarceration rate of natives, Kirsanow compares the number of individuals incarcerated with their total population. This nonsensical apples-to-oranges comparison yields an exceedingly unfavorable ""incarceration rate"" for undocumented immigrants. Indeed, for three of the five states he examines, the undocumented incarceration rate is 10-100 points higher than the natives, when more credible studies show that the reality may be closer to the opposite.*
Kirsanow failed to appreciate that the purpose of the GAO report was to estimate the reimbursement that Uncle Sam owes state and local governments for incarcerating criminal illegal immigrants. Thus, the agency was only interested in the total number of incarcerations over the course of a year. It didn't care to separate out the number of offenses from the number of offenders. That is why the GAO report is nearly worthless for any scholarly attempt to estimate illegal immigrant crime rates.
A quick look at American Community Survey (ACS) data further confirms just how out-of-line Kirsanow's estimate is. (The ACS is an annual mini-census that, among other things, gathers information about prisoners in adult correctional facilities. It doesn't report on the broad legal status of immigrants but does indicate whether they are American citizens and their country of birth, making it possible to separate immigrants from Americans.)
For 2008, the ACS reported that there were 156,329 non-citizens incarcerated in all three—federal, state, and local—adult correctional facilities. This is only half of the 296,959 incarcerations that SCAAP reports in just state and local prisons making it logically impossible for the 296,959 figure to be referring to the total number of criminal aliens incarcerated.
Kirsanow is merely an individual whose analysis can be discounted. But there is no discounting the Alien Incarceration Report jointly released by the Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Homeland Security (DHS) last December. It too misrepresented data when it estimated that ""one-in-five of all persons in the [federal] Bureau of Prisons custody were foreign born, and that 94 percent of confirmed aliens in custody were unlawfully present."" That seems shockingly high as illegal immigrants are, at most, about 4 percent of the population. But if this report were right, they would be 19 percent of all prisoners.
But the report had no solid basis for its conclusion because it did not have all the prison data. If you scroll down beyond the report's press release and Summary of Findings, it admits as much. It notes:
This report does not include data on the foreign-born or alien populations in state prisons and local jails because state and local facilities do not routinely provide DHS or DOJ with comprehensive information about their inmates and detainees. This limitation is noteworthy because state and local facilities account for approximately 90 percent of the total U.S. incarcerated population. DHS and DOJ are working to develop a reliable methodology for estimating the status of state and local incarcerated populations in future reports. Of course that didn't stop Fox News and other similar outfits from using it to peddle their ""illegal immigrants are hardened criminal"" line.
It is really important to bear in mind that the federal prison population is not representative of the incarcerated populations in state and local prisons. That's because federal prisons house illegal immigrants who commit immigration offenses. The ones who commit more serious crimes tend to be housed in state adult correctional facilities.
Only 85 total people who were convicted of murder were sentenced to federal prison in 2016. But the total number of murder convictions nationwide that year was 17,785. Clearly, only a small fraction of a percent of all murderers are incarcerated in federal prisons so most undocumented immigrants in these facilities are not hardened criminals.
As Kirsanow acknowledged, the government doesn't keep good data on illegal immigrant incarcerations in state correctional facilities. But the data we do have suggests that they are actually much less crime-prone than native-born Americans.
The Texas Tribune reported, after examining data obtained from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, that illegal immigrants are underrepresented in local jails. They are only 4.6 percent of Texas inmates while they make up 6.3 percent of that state's total population.
Some academic researchers have examined quasi-natural policy shifts to see how crime rates change due to more intense immigration enforcement. If illegal immigrants are more crime-prone, then more aggressive immigration enforcement in an area should lower crime rates. But they found no overall reduction. This suggests, at a minimum, that illegal immigrants' crime rate is no higher than that of the broader population.
More recent research conduced by Michelangelo Landgrave and me finds similar results. We applied a statistical technique that is used to figure out the employment, age, and occupations of immigrants in the census to the incarcerated population data in the American Community Survey. This allowed us to estimate the percentage of illegals among the incarcerated. We found that even if one includes in the mix those in detention facilities—most whom are there for immigration-related offenses—illegal immigrants are 44 percent less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans. Excluding those in immigration detention yields an incarceration rate that is almost identical to that of legal immigrants: A dramatic 69 percent lower than that of natives.
Restrictionists want the public to believe that undocumented immigrants are criminals in order to justify harsh enforcement policies and crackdowns. But before America goes down this draconian path, it is vital that it gets the facts straight. Taking amateur analyses or government spin at face value will hurt peaceful and hardworking immigrants without making Americans safer.
*CORRECTION: Due to an editing error, this sentence initially stated that the undocumented incarceration rate was higher in all the states examined. It is higher in three of the five."
5084,Trump\xe2\x80\x99s claim that immigrants bring \xe2\x80\x98tremendous crime\xe2\x80\x99 is still wrong',Washington Post,2/2/2018,,,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/01/18/trumps-claim-that-immigrants-bring-tremendous-crime-is-still-wrong/,"— President Trump, in remarks at the White House, Dec. 6
Trump earned Four Pinocchios the last time we looked into his claim that immigrants cause crime rates to rise in the United States. Fresh data and several new studies have been released since that fact-check in 2015, and we took another look at the body of knowledge to see how the president’s view holds up.
AD
When we fact-checked him as a candidate in 2015, Trump spoke of immigrants generally and without distinguishing between legal and unauthorized residents. But in his most recent statements on Dec. 6, the president narrowed it down to “illegal immigrants … bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.” (We’re not evaluating Trump’s claim that Democrats “want to have illegal immigrants.”)
AD
Is Trump on solid ground now when he says unauthorized immigrants make the country less safe?
The Facts
As we found in 2015, it’s all but impossible to determine whether Trump’s statement is accurate concerning either legal or undocumented immigrants.
The Department of Justice says 90 percent of prisoners are housed at the state or local levels. That’s because almost all crimes are prosecuted by state and local law enforcement agencies, not the federal government.
AD
States generally do not track how many of their prisoners are undocumented immigrants. But most states do report their total number of noncitizen prisoners every year to the Justice Department, without breaking down their legal status.
Noncitizens accounted for 4 percent of the total prison population in the states, according to reports from the Bureau of Justice Statistics from 2013 to 2016, the most recent year for which data are available. (This figure excludes California and a handful of other states that did not provide data on noncitizen prisoners to the Justice Department.)
AD
At the federal level, noncitizens made up 11 percent to 12 percent of the total prison population from 2013 to 2015, the reports show. The Bureau of Justice Statistics changed its methodology in 2018 at the request of the Justice Department, said Elizabeth Ann Carson, the bureau’s statistician. So in the 2016 report, the number of noncitizen federal prisoners jumped from 21,479 to 39,956, or from 11 percent of the federal prison population to 21 percent, because of this methodology change, she said.
AD
The difference is that the Bureau of Justice Statistics previously reported the number of noncitizens housed in federal prisons, but now it adds those in privately run or community correctional facilities. The BJS data do not factor in persons detained by the Department of Homeland Security, which enforces immigration laws.
The 21 percent rate now appears to track with separate data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which found that noncitizens accounted for 20 percent of total federal prison sentences in fiscal year 2016, excluding immigration offenses.
AD
Trump’s campaign pointed to Sentencing Commission data to support its claims in 2015. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
AD
Some experts say the BJS data are unreliable because, among other reasons, state officials ask prisoners to self-report whether they are legal or undocumented residents. As we noted, a handful of states do not report their number of noncitizen prisoners to the Justice Department, which means the BJS data undercount the total.
But since it’s the closest thing to a yardstick provided by the federal government, it’s worth analyzing the data. (Incidentally, the Homeland Security and Justice departments “are working to develop a reliable methodology for estimating the status of state and local incarcerated populations in future reports,” according to a December report they released.)
AD
Excluding five states that did not provide data, state and federal correctional facilities in 2016 housed 1.3 million prisoners, of which 83,556, or 6 percent, were noncitizens, according to the latest BJS report. The total immigrant population stood at 43.7 million in 2016, or 13.5 percent, according to Census data.
AD
A comparison of these figures shows that noncitizens are far underrepresented in the prison population at the state level (4 percent), overrepresented at the federal level after excluding immigration offenses (21 percent), and far below their share of the population when combining both state and federal prisons (6 percent).
Let’s move on to the new research studies released since our fact-check from 2015.
The majority of the research available on this question continues to show that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born and that overall crime rates decline in areas where immigrants settle. However, many of these studies use statistical modeling in the absence of reliable and standardized state-level data about immigrant prisoners or convicts.
AD
AD
A March 2017 study by the pro-immigration Cato Institute found that “all immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than natives relative to their shares of the population” and that “even illegal immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans.”
Analyzing Census data from the 2014 American Community Survey, authors Michelangelo Landgrave and Alex Nowrasteh found that 2,194,435 individuals were incarcerated in 2014. The imprisonment rate for unauthorized immigrants was 0.85 percent, and 0.47 percent for legal immigrants, they found. Subtracting immigration-related offenses, the rate was lower for unauthorized immigrants: 0.5 percent.
The American Immigration Council, another pro-immigration group, estimated that there were 11.2 million undocumented immigrants in 2013. The total population that year was 316.2 million, according to the Census, which means illegal immigrants made up 3.5 percent of the total population when using the council’s estimate.
AD
AD
Cato’s study suggests that unauthorized immigrants are dramatically underrepresented in the U.S. prison population, including or excluding immigration offenses. Meanwhile, 45 percent of Americans say immigrants make the crime situation worse, 9 percent say they make the crime situation better, and 43 percent say there is not much effect, according to a Gallup survey from 2017.
“We’re running against the popular current,” Nowrasteh said. “We’re not running against the weight of empirical evidence on this claim. Our findings are actually pretty consistent with those in peer-reviewed journals as well as other scholarly publications.”
According to “The Integration of Immigrants into American Society,” a 2015 peer-reviewed study of years of academic research, the perception that immigrants bring crime to the United States has been popular for nearly a century and “is perpetuated by ‘issue entrepreneurs’ who promote the immigrant-crime connection in order to drive restrictionist immigration policy.”
AD
AD
“Far from immigration increasing crime rates, studies demonstrate that immigrants and immigration are associated inversely with crime,” the study, published by the National Academy of Sciences, concludes. “Immigrants are less likely than the native-born to commit crimes, and neighborhoods with greater concentrations of immigrants have much lower rates of crime and violence than comparable nonimmigrant neighborhoods. However, crime rates rise among the second and later generations, perhaps a negative consequence of adaptation to American society.”
But, once again pointing to the dearth of good data, the authors added: “While the research is conclusive on the statistical relation between immigration and crime, there is still a lot to be learned because of limitations in the available data. The extent to which this relationship is truly generalizable or robust for all immigrant groups needs further study.”
As the Fact Checker reported in 2015, one study showed that between 1990 and 2013, “the foreign-born share of the U.S. population grew from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent and the number of unauthorized immigrants more than tripled from 3.5 million to 11.2 million.
AD
“During the same period, FBI data indicate that the violent crime rate declined 48 percent — which included falling rates of aggravated assault, robbery, rape, and murder. Likewise, the property crime rate fell 41 percent, including declining rates of motor vehicle theft, larceny/robbery, and burglary,” according to the American Immigration Council.
In short, the violent crime rate was cut nearly by half during a period in which unauthorized immigrants tripled, according to the council.
Some experts caution that this study and Cato’s — which are based on Census data — and the Bureau of Justice Statistics figures should all be taken with a heavy dose of salt. State authorities and census workers are relying on offenders to self-report whether they are legal residents or undocumented, which is not an easy proposition for those facing possible deportation.
“Is the ACS doing a good job of capturing the foreign-born? It didn’t in the past,” said Steven A. Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which has documented several issues with the quality of Census data on immigrant prisoners. “The question is, How good is it now? … What I can say is that the incarceration data in the ACS looks more consistent over time, but that sometimes means it could be consistently undercounting.”
Across the spectrum, experts agree that Trump’s claims are nearly impossible to verify without reliable and standardized data on state-level offenders who are undocumented immigrants.
Camarota’s group opposes sanctuary city policies and advocates for less legal immigration. He added that without solid data from the states, it’s not possible to reach sound conclusions on immigrant crime rates. “It is not our contention that the data is clear that immigrants commit a disproportionate share of crime,” Camarota said.
John R. Lott of the Crime Prevention Research Center in December released a study of prisoner data from the Arizona Department of Corrections. “The murder and manslaughter rate for illegal immigrants is 2.7 times higher than the average for U.S. citizens,” Lott said of the study, which maps 32 1/2 years of prisoner statistics in a state with a history of making headlines for its tough immigration enforcement policies.
“While undocumented immigrants from 15 to 35 years of age make up a little over 2 percent of the Arizona population, they make up almost 8 percent of the prison population,” Lott found. “These immigrants also tend to commit more serious crimes.”
He added that undocumented immigrants in the Arizona data, which cover 1985 to 2017, had the highest incarceration rate compared with legal immigrants and U.S. citizens. Legal immigrants had a lower rate than U.S. citizens, he said.
“What we’re finding is that people who are legal immigrants tend to be extremely law-abiding,” Lott said. “But illegal immigrants commit crimes at extremely high rates. And when you lump them together you get something in the middle.”
The Arizona figures are “great data in the sense that it doesn’t lump the two together” and because they do not rely on offenders self-reporting their immigration status, Lott said.
Lott’s review appears to be unique — no other comparable research on state correctional data has been conducted — and an outlier, since the majority of other studies have come to diametrically opposite conclusions, including those in peer-reviewed publications. [Update: After we published this fact-check, Lott’s methodology was called into question. We dive into that debate in a separate fact-check.]
The Pinocchio Test
Trump for years has argued that immigrants pose a threat to public safety, bringing higher crime to the communities where they settle. When we last fact-checked his statements in 2015, Trump was speaking about immigrants generally and without separating legal residents from unauthorized ones. Most recently, on Dec. 6, the president said “illegal immigrants” were “bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.”
The Justice Department reports that 90 percent of U.S. prisoners are housed in state or local institutions, and because states generally do not report data breaking down how many of their prisoners are undocumented immigrants, experts on several sides of the immigration debate say it is not possible to verify Trump’s claim. The admittedly incomplete data that the Justice Department does publish on noncitizen prisoners does not support Trump’s claims.
Almost all the independent research on this question — do immigrants bring more crime? — contradicted Trump in 2015 and continues to do so today as we look at newer studies. One report based on Arizona reaches a different conclusion: that undocumented immigrants do commit crimes at higher rates than U.S. citizens or legal immigrants. But it’s not scientific to extrapolate Arizona’s figures to form nationwide conclusions.
The bottom line is that a great majority of research on this question contradicts Trump’s claim, even in its narrower form focused only on “illegal immigrants.” There is a possibility that Census data on which many of these studies are based could be giving an inaccurate count of who is and is not undocumented. But there is no way to prove it because of the lack of reliable, standardized data from the states, where 90 percent of prisoners are housed. As always, the burden of proof rests with the speaker, so the president once again earns Four Pinocchios.

2953,"Trump offers 'Dreamers' a path to citizenship, wants other immigration curbs""",Reuters,1/26/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration/trump-offers-dreamers-a-path-to-citizenship-wants-other-immigration-curbs-idUSKBN1FE2QX,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is offering a path to citizenship for up to 1.8 million young illegal immigrants but insists on measures that would curb some legal immigration programs and provide a border wall with Mexico, senior White House officials said on Thursday.
The White House offered to more than double the number of “Dreamers” - people brought to the country illegally as children - who would be protected from deportation, describing it as a major concession aimed at attracting enough votes for an immigration deal from Democrats.
But the plan comes with significant strings attached to appeal to Republicans, including requirements to slash family sponsorship of immigrants, tighten border security and provide billions of dollars in funding for a border wall with Mexico that Trump made one of his major campaign promises.
The package was immediately panned by pro-immigration groups, which said the plan was a bad trade-off. It was also slammed by some conservative groups, which decried the expansion of “amnesty” for illegal immigrants.
The head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Democratic Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, said the Trump plan used Dreamers as “bargaining chips for sweeping anti-immigrant policies.”
Early reaction from Republicans in the Senate - where the plan may receive a vote in early February - was positive. Conservative Republican Senator Tom Cotton called the plan “generous and humane, while also being responsible.” Republicans narrowly control the chamber by 51-49 and need Democratic votes to pass legislation.
The fight over protections for Dreamers, which are set to expire in March, was part of the standoff between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that resulted in a three-day government shutdown that ended on Monday.
They agreed to extend funding until Feb. 8, leaving a small window to come to a deal on immigration. Trump’s plan will help provide guidance for those talks, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement.
Negotiations will be tough. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, who has championed the cause of the Dreamers, said the plan put Trump’s “entire hardline immigration agenda - including massive cuts to legal immigration - on the backs of these young people.”
‘HORRENDOUS TRADE-OFF’
Trump, whose tough immigration stance was a key part of his 2016 presidential campaign, said in September he was ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program for Dreamers that was created by Democratic predecessor Barack Obama.
The DACA protections apply to about 700,000 people, but White House officials said there were at least that many illegal immigrants who qualified for the program but did not sign up for it.
Officials said the 1.8 million people could apply to become citizens in 10 to 12 years providing they had jobs and did not commit crimes.
Trump’s plan would require Congress to set up a $25 billion “trust fund” to build a wall on the southern border with Mexico, and invest in better protections at the northern border with Canada.
Congress would have to allocate additional money to border guards and immigration judges, a figure that the Republican president pegged at $5 billion on Wednesday, but which White House officials said was up for further discussion.
The White House also wants Congress to change rules to allow for the rapid deportation of illegal immigrants from countries other than Mexico and Canada who arrive at the U.S. border, the officials said.
White House officials made clear that a deal could not only address DACA and the border wall but must also end a visa lottery program for certain countries and limit family sponsorship of immigrants to spouses and minor children - ending sponsorship for parents, older children and siblings.
Stephen Legomsky, who was chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration, called the plan a “horrendous tradeoff” and predicted Democrats would reject it.
“It offers a one-time citizenship path to innocent Dreamers and expects in return a massive permanent cut to family immigration, the permanent elimination of the entire diversity program, and a huge expenditure for a border wall,” said Legomsky, now at Washington University Law School in St. Louis.
A group of immigrant youth called United We Dream said the deal was “pitting us against our own parents, Black immigrants and our communities.”
Groups that oppose allowing illegal immigrants to remain in the United States also voiced criticism, and urged Congress to take its time.
“While it includes a number of tough immigration enforcement provisions, it includes an amnesty that is more than twice the size of the DACA population,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors restrictions.
HOUSE PATH UNCLEAR
To become law, the measures would also need to pass the House of Representatives, where Republicans have a bigger majority. A senior White House official declined to speculate on whether the plan would pass the chamber.
“I think the House will have an independent vehicle,” the second official said. “We’re not trying to force something on the House.”
Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, a Republican Cuban-American from Miami and longtime advocate of immigration reform, praised Trump for putting forward a “serious proposal.”

Democratic Representative Luis Gutiérrez said, however, that the plan “doesn’t pass the laugh test.
“It would be far cheaper to erect a 50-foot concrete statue of a middle finger and point it towards Latin America, because both a wall and the statue would be equally offensive and equally ineffective,” the Illinois lawmaker said on Twitter."
6405,Trump immigration proposal could provide path to citizenship for 1.8 million in US illegally',Fox News (Online),1/26/2018,,,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/25/trump-immigration-proposal-could-provide-path-to-citizenship-for-1-8-million-in-us-illegally.html,"The White House Thursday released an immigration plan that would offer a path to citizenship for approximately 1.8 million of the so-called ""Dreamers,"" along with a $25 billion investment in border security -- including for President Trump's long-promised wall.
The White House was expected to provide more details of the president's proposal early next week. But the proposal represents a reversal for Trump and could provoke resistance among his conservative allies.
In September, Trump ended the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which currently covers roughly 690,000 immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.
""We're not looking at citizenship,"" Trump told reporters at the time. ""We're not looking at amnesty. We're looking at allowing people to stay here.""
On Wednesday, however, Trump said he was open to a pathway to citizenship for younger immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as children.
""We're going to morph into it,"" Trump told reporters. ""It's going to happen, at some point in the future, over a period of 10 to 12 years.""
The nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute said it believes the largest share of the White House's 1.8 million people who'd be eligible for citizenship -- 1.3 million -- are people who currently meet all of DACA's eligibility requirements. These include years in the U.S., their ages now and when they entered this country, and whether they have a high school or equivalent education.
Another 400,000 are people who'd be eligible for DACA protection but for their education. And 100,000 more are people who are under age 15 --the minimum age allowed for most people requesting protection under the program.
Legal status for the recipients would be revocable for criminal behavior and national security threats, sources familiar with the plan told Fox News, and eventual citizenship would require still-unspecified work and education requirements -- and a finding that the immigrants are of ""good moral character.""
Trump's plan would restrict new family-based immigration to spouses and minor children, doing away with provisions allowing parents, adult siblings and others to enter the country. The sources said it would only end new applications for visas, allowing those already in the pipeline to be processed.
It would also end the diversity visa lottery program, which drew Trump's attention after the New York City truck attack last year, redirecting the allotment annually to bringing down the existing backlog in visa applications.
Trump had deferred to a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers to craft an immigration proposal, saying he would sign whatever they passed. But as talks on Capitol Hill broke down -- in part because of controversy Trump ginned up using vulgar language to describe other countries -- the White House decided to offer its own framework.
The release follows on concerns raised by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that the president had not sufficiently laid out his priorities. One official said the Thursday release represents a plan for the Senate, with the administration expecting a different bill to pass the House.
In a statement, McConnell said the White House plan ""indicates what is necessary for the president to sign a bill into law.""
""I am hopeful that as discussions continue in the Senate on the subject of immigration, Members on both sides of the aisle will look to this framework for guidance as they work towards an agreement,"" McConnell added.
Doug Andres, a spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., echoed the sentiment saying: ""We're grateful for the president showing leadership on this issue and believe his ideas will help us ultimately reach a balanced solution.""
But a spokesman for House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., blasted the plan as part of a ""hateful anti-immigrant agenda.""
Drew Hammill accused White House aide Stephen Miller, a staunch opponent of illegal immigration, of ""trying to ransom the lives of innocent DREAMers for a $25 billion anti-immigrant wish list.""
""The White House strategy of moving the goal posts every time the President isn't paying attention continues to complicate this process,"" he said in a statement.
The president's most loyal media ally, Breitbart News, attacked Trump as ""Amnesty Don."" The conservative group Heritage Action for America said the proposal ""should be a non-starter.""
However, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who played a key role in immigration talks earlier this month, said Trump's proposal was ""generous and humane, while also being responsible.""
""It protects those eligible for DACA, who are here through no fault of their own. But it also will prevent us from ending up back here in five years by securing the border and putting an end to extended-family chain migration.""
Among other Republicans, Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford said he supports the citizenship pathway Trump described Wednesday. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., called Trump's words ""positive"" and said Trump's description ""gives us a better sense"" of his views, but added, ""We have a long way to go yet.""
Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., said the White House framework was ""something that both Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate should be eager to support.
""We all want a good deal,"" Perdue added, ""and here it is.""
Some of Congress' more conservative members seemed unwilling to open the citizenship door for the Dreamers.
""DACA itself didn't have a pathway to citizenship,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who battled Trump in 2016 for the GOP presidential nomination. ""So I think it would be a profound mistake and not consistent with the promises we made to the voters, to enact a pathway to citizenship to DACA recipients or to others who are here illegally.""
Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said he supports a more conservative, more sweeping immigration bill proposed by House members, including House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., which has won strong support from House conservatives. Ryan has promised to push for support for that measure.
Meanwhile, immigration activists blasted the plan. Lorella Praeli, with the American Civil Liberties Union, called it ""a hateful, xenophobic immigration proposal that would slash legal immigration to levels not seen since the racial quotas of the 1920s, eliminate legal immigration channels for African countries, and spend $25 billion for a harmful, wasteful border wall and an increase in Border Patrol and ICE agents. ""
""The White House proposal is clearly an effort to sabotage bipartisan talks on the issue by continuing to put issues on the table that are non-starters,"" she said.

""Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fully understands, especially after his humiliating defeat, that if there is no Wall, there is no DACA,"" the president tweeted around 11 p.m. ET. ""We must have safety and security, together with a strong Military, for our great people!""
Earlier Tuesday evening, White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley slammed Schumer during an appearance on Fox News' ""Outnumbered Overtime.""
“He comes over here with a phony plan and a fake promise,” Gidley said, referring to Schumer, D-N.Y.
A Schumer aide confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday that the leader withdrew his offer of a boost in funding for the president’s proposed border wall. It was initially made during negotiations over the government spending bill with the president last Friday, the aide said.
Schumer’s office says he pulled the wall offer on Sunday.
But Gidley said they didn’t take the offer seriously, saying the Democrat offered less than one-tenth of what was needed to secure the border in his “bogus negotiation.” The administration wants $18 billion for a border wall.
“You can't rescind money you never really offered in the first place,” he said.
After a three-day government shutdown, Democrats agreed to re-open the government Monday after Republicans assured them the Senate would soon consider legislation that would protect the so-called Dreamers.
SCHUMER BASHED BY LEFT OVER SHUTDOWN-ENDING DEAL
During Tuesday’s press briefing at the White House, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the president opposes an immigration proposal brokered by Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois.
“In a bipartisan meeting here at the White House two weeks ago we outlined a path forward on four issues: serious border security, an end to chain migration, the cancellation of the outdated and unsafe visa lottery and a permanent solution to DACA,” Sanders said. “Unfortunately, the Flake-Graham-Durbin agreement does not meet these benchmarks.”

3106,"Democrats withdraw offer to fund Trump's border wall""",Reuters,1/24/2018,,,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration/democrats-withdraw-offer-to-fund-trumps-border-wall-idUSKBN1FC236,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats said on Tuesday they had withdrawn an offer to fund U.S. President Donald Trump’s border wall, as tough negotiations over the future of young illegal immigrants known as “Dreamers” resumed in the Senate.
A day after the end of a government shutdown linked to wrangling over immigration, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he pulled the offer because of what he said was Trump’s failure to follow through on the outlines of an agreement the two men discussed on Friday.
“So we’re going to have to start on a new basis and the wall offer is off the table,” Schumer told reporters. An aide said the offer was withdrawn on Sunday.
Trump said on Twitter late on Tuesday night: “Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fully understands, especially after his humiliating defeat, that if there is no Wall, there is no DACA. We must have safety and security, together with a strong Military, for our great people!”
The Congressional Hispanic Caucus expressed fears on Tuesday that Republicans in the House of Representatives would pursue a harsh immigration bill written by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte.
The House measure would allow Dreamers to renew their legal status for three years, instead of putting them on a pathway to citizenship, and would call for hiring 10,000 more agents at U.S. borders while shutting down some visa programs and taking other steps to find people who are in the country illegally.
Republican Trump said during the 2016 election campaign Mexico would pay the cost of building a wall along the southwestern border of the United States to keep out illegal immigrants. Mexico has rejected the idea.
As a result, Trump has been forced to ask Congress for U.S. taxpayer funds for the wall. Government estimates are that it could cost more than $21 billion.
With Democrats and many Republicans arguing there are more effective border enforcement tools than a wall, the proposal has become a major sticking point in immigration negotiations, which in turn have complicated talks about funding federal agencies.
The Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, Dick Durbin, asked by a reporter whether Schumer offered Trump $25 billion for the wall in a major concession to the president, did not dispute the figure, but said: “He did it in the context of a negotiation.”

PROTECTING THE ‘DREAMERS’
Democrats have been spearheading an effort to protect about 700,000 young Dreamers after Trump announced in September the end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program instituted by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.
The program, which began in 2012, gave qualified Dreamers, who were brought illegally to the United States as children, temporary protection from deportation and the ability to study and work in the United States.
Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, criticized Schumer for pulling the wall funding offer.
“That basically sets the DACA discussion back,” he told reporters.
Cornyn said there had been discussions of he and Durbin being a “clearing house” for suggestions from senators on legislation to rescue Dreamers from the threat of deportation and provide permanent protections for them.
In agreeing on Monday to end a three-day government shutdown - the first since 2013 - and fund the government until Feb. 8, Senate Democrats got a promise from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that he would allow an immigration debate on the Senate floor in the near future.
Durbin said a similar commitment was now needed from Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, where a Dreamer bill would presumably face a much harder path to passage than in the Senate.
The White House on Tuesday rejected the idea that a bipartisan bill sponsored by Durbin and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham could be the core of a solution.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the proposal was “totally unacceptable to the president and should be declared dead on arrival.”

Trump himself has vacillated on immigration between tough rhetoric demanding a U.S. border wall and a softer tone urging a “bill of love” for Dreamers.
“Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans & Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8, but everyone will be trying,” Trump tweeted."
5290,Trump Denies Changing His Position on Border Wall',New York Times (Online News),1/18/2018,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/us/politics/trump-kelly-border-wall.html,"Asked whether he minded Mr. Kelly telling lawmakers he had not been fully informed about immigration, Mr. Trump said: “No, he did not say that. He didn’t say it the way you would like him to say it.”
But according to one person familiar with the president’s thinking, Mr. Trump was livid when he learned that Mr. Kelly had described him as “evolving” in his immigration position. Throughout the evening on Wednesday, Mr. Trump fielded calls from allies who described Mr. Kelly’s comments to Congress as undermining the president, stoking Mr. Trump’s fury.
The president — who never likes it when someone characterizes his thinking — vented his anger to Mr. Kelly and to allies, according to the person familiar with the president’s thinking. It was similar to a moment during the campaign in April of 2016, when Paul Manafort — who had just been hired to the Trump campaign — was caught on tape at a meeting with Republican National Committee members saying of Mr. Trump, “the part he’s been playing is evolving.”
When a president’s chief of staff speaks to members of Congress, it should be a “consistent message,” Representative Henry Cuellar, a Democrat of Texas, said on Thursday in an interview with CNN. Mr. Cuellar, who attended Wednesday’s meeting with Mr. Kelly, said the inconsistency “makes it hard” to negotiate.
Lawmakers who attended the meeting on Wednesday described Mr. Kelly’s remarks. Representative Luis V. Gutiérrez, a Democrat of Illinois who was at the meeting, said Mr. Kelly told the group that “a 50-foot wall from sea to shining sea isn’t what we’re going to build.”
Mr. Gutiérrez told reporters that Mr. Kelly referenced Mr. Trump’s campaign promises to build a wall and said, “There were statements made about the wall that were not informed statements.”
In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday night, Mr. Kelly defended his comments to the Democratic lawmakers and said, “There’s been an evolutionary process that this president has gone through, as a campaign, and I pointed out to all of the members that were in the room that they all say things during the course of campaigns that may or may not be fully informed.”"

“The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it,” Trump wrote in an early-morning tweet.
The tweet came after lawmakers who met with White House chief of staff John Kelly John Francis KellyMORE told The Washington Post and other news outlets that the top aide said some of Trump’s campaign promises on immigration, including the wall, are “uninformed.”
The Post reported that Kelly told lawmakers some parts of the border do not need a wall and there will be no physical barrier “that Mexico will pay for.”

Trump tweeted that “parts will be, of necessity, see through” and wrote that the wall “was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains, wastelands or tough rivers or water.”
He added that it “will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S.”

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2018
The exchange marks a rare public break between Trump and Kelly, whom the president tapped as chief of staff last summer to bring stability to a White House that had been wracked by chaos.
Kelly’s claim that Trump’s views on immigration have evolved came as Congress struggles to broker a deal on shielding hundreds of thousands of immigrations from deportation.
Those immigrants, who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, benefitted from the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which Trump scrapped last year. The program winds down on March 5.
Trump and Republican lawmakers have said they would support protections for DACA recipients if they are tied to strict border security measures, including wall funding, and sweeping reforms to the nation’s legal immigration system. Democrats have balked at some of those demands.
Kelly echoed his comments during an interview with Fox News, hours after he reportedly first made them during the meeting with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
“He's very definitely changed his attitudes toward the DACA issue and even the wall once we briefed him,” Kelly said, referring to Trump
Kelly said he told the Hispanic lawmakers that Trump has “evolved in the way he's looked at things” and that all politicians “say things during the course of campaigns that may or may not be fully informed.”
“Campaigning to governing are two different things, and this president has been very, very flexible in terms of what is within the realm of the possible,” he added.
Kelly’s comments may have irked the president because they suggested Trump did not know enough about border security during the campaign, when he promised to build a “great, great wall on our southern border” and “make Mexico pay for that wall.”
The wall was one of Trump’s core campaign promises, and he has repeatedly pledged to fulfill it as president. Kelly’s comments, however, acknowledged that campaign promises might not always be completely fulfilled.
Trump has previously chafed at aides who have been framed as wise men keeping him on the right path. He was reportedly angered by a Time magazine cover last year that cast his former chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, as “The Great Manipulator”
The president also has not been afraid to publicly undercut comments made by his senior staff. He tweeted last summer that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Rex Wayne TillersonMcEnany: Trump likes to hire people with 'countervailing viewpoints' Bolton book shows nastiness rules at Trump White House The Memo: Bolton exposé makes Trump figure of mockery MORE was “wasting his time” by seeking talks with North Korea over its nuclear-weapons program.
Kelly has been one of Trump’s go-to people in dealing with Congress with regard to a DACA fix. He formerly led the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the nation’s immigration system, and was the top U.S. military commander in Latin America.
Despite Kelly’s efforts, lawmakers have been frustrated with Trump’s shifting position on DACA and a broader immigration deal.
Last week, he hosted Republican and Democratic lawmakers at the White House for an extraordinary public negotiating session, during which he said he would sign virtually any immigration bill they put on his desk.
But he helped throw a wrench in the talks by reportedly making comments about ""shithole countries"" during a meeting where a bipartisan group of lawmakers offered a compromise proposal. Trump later called the measure “horrible” on border security.
“We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country,” Trump tweeted Thursday morning. “We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico, now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall, there is no Deal!""

“There’s been an evolutionary process that this president has gone through,” Kelly said in an interview with Fox News host Bret Baier, pointing out that Trump had “very definitely changed his attitude” towards DACA recipients and the wall.
But Trump pushed back on Twitter against the suggestion that he had evolved on the wall.
“The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it,” Trump said.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2018
He explained that parts of the wall would be “see-through” and that it was never meant to stretch across the whole 2,000-mile border where there were already natural barriers.
Kelly said that he and border experts told Trump that 800 miles of wall would “suffice” which included 600 miles of existing fencing.
“He has evolved in the way he’s looked at things,” Kelly said. “Campaign to governing are two different things and this president has been very, very flexible in terms of what is within the realm of the possible.”
Kelly also suggested that the wall would not be paid “directly” by Mexico, something that Trump also corrected.
“The Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S.,” he wrote. “The $20 billion dollar Wall is ‘peanuts’ compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S. NAFTA is a bad joke!”

Trump added that without wall funding there would be no DACA deal.
“We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country,” he wrote. “We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico, now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall, there is no Deal!”"
5337,"DACA Renewal Applications Resume After Judge's Ruling""",Townhall,1/14/2018,,,https://townhall.com/tipsheet/timothymeads/2018/01/14/daca-renewal-applications-resume-after-judges-ruling-n2434382,"Yesterday, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it would resume the application renewal process for illegal aliens seeking protection from deportation after being brought into the United States as children. These “Dreamers”, as they are known in some circles, had previously been shielded from deportation under President Barack Obama’s executive order known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA).
On Tuesday January 9th, U.S. District Judge William Allsup ruled that President Donald J. Trump did not have the legal authority to rescind some parts of the program. In September 2017, Trump pledged to end DACA altogether unless Democrats and Republicans in Congress could craft a bill addressing serious legal and immigration issues that he could sign. Allsup ruled that the DHS must accept applications from individuals seeking to renew their ""Dreamer"" status, but did not have to accept new applications from individuals applying for the first time.
""These individuals had submitted substantial personal identifying information to the government, paid hefty fees and planned their lives according to the dictates of DACA,"" the Judge wrote. ""The administrative record includes no consideration to the disruption a rescission would have on the lives of DACA recipients, let alone their families, employers and employees, schools and communities.""
He added that the government's arguments were ""arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion.""
After hearing Allsup’s decision, the White House strongly condemned what some may say is judicial overreach. ""An issue of this magnitude must go through the normal legislative process,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. ""President Trump is committed to the rule of law, and will work with members of both parties to reach a permanent solution that corrects the unconstitutional actions taken by the last administration.""
And President Trump tweeted on Wednesday, ""It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts.”
On Sunday morning, President Trump once again took to Twitter to slam America’s immigration policy. ""DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don’t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military,” he proclaimed.
Moments the president later called for a merit based immigration system.
“I, as President, want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again, people coming in through a system based on MERIT. No more Lotteries! #AMERICA FIRST,” he added.
So far, Republicans and Democrats have not been able to compromise on an immigration reform bill that would also address the problem of illegal aliens and ""Dreamers"" currently in the United States."

The Department of Homeland Security says it will once again accept renewal requests from recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in response to a court order.
""Until further notice, and unless otherwise provided in this guidance, the DACA policy will be operated on the terms in place before it was rescinded on Sept. 5, 2017,"" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a part of DHS, wrote on its website Saturday.
The Obama administration began the program in 2012, which enabled certain young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children to apply for work permits and protection from deportation. As of September, about 700,000 people are currently protected under the program.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in September that the Trump administration would wind down the DACA program. The administration said it was executive overreach and called on Congress to come up with a solution to the status of DACA recipients, also called DREAMers.
But a federal judge in San Francisco halted that plan late Tuesday and ordered the administration to resume processing DACA renewals while a lawsuit against the September decision moves forward.
The statement from USCIS says people who have already been granted deportation deferral under DACA can request renewal, but the agency will not accept new requests from people who have never received deferred action before. If someone's DACA expired on or after Sept. 5, 2016, that person may file a renewal request, the agency says; people who received DACA that expired before then can file a new DACA request.
President Trump held a meeting with lawmakers on Tuesday about passing new legislation to allow the DREAMers to stay in the country, though he has pushed for funding for a wall with Mexico to be part of any immigration policy overhaul. He also received widespread criticism this past week after reports that he referred to immigrants from certain countries using a vulgar slur."
5925,"DACA Participants Can Again Apply for Renewal, Immigration Agency Says'",New York Times (Online News),1/14/2018,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/14/us/politics/daca-renewals-requests.html,"Later that day, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco handed down his ruling, writing that the administration must “maintain the DACA program on a nationwide basis” as the legal challenge to the president’s decision goes forward.
In his ruling, Judge Alsup laid out a road map for the government that officials appeared to follow. He said that previous beneficiaries of DACA, known as Dreamers, must be allowed to renew their status in the program, though the government would not be required to accept new applications from immigrants who had not previously submitted one.
On Sunday morning, Mr. Trump blamed Democrats for preventing progress on a legislative deal that would permanently legalize the young immigrants and give them an eventual path to citizenship in exchange for tougher border security and enforcement measures.
The president criticized Democratic lawmakers, some of whom have suggested that they will not support efforts to fund the government by a deadline later this week unless Congress passes the DACA legislation.
“DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don’t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla.
In a second tweet, Mr. Trump said that immigration legislation should include an end to the diversity visa lottery system, in which the State Department encourages diversity in immigration by holding a lottery for those wanting to come to the United States.
The president has criticized the program as a threat to the country’s security even though people selected are screened in the same ways that other immigrants are. Mr. Trump has also said that the program undermines efforts by the administration to allow immigrants who have skills that will be beneficial to the United States.
“I, as President, want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again, people coming in through a system based on MERIT,” he said. “No more Lotteries! #AMERICA FIRST.”"

U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled the Obama-era program must remain in place while litigation plays out.
Alsup, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, also said the program should continue, allowing those already approved for the program to renew their DACA protections and work permits.
New applications will not be allowed to be submitted under the ruling, however.
""Dreamers' lives were thrown into chaos when the Trump Administration tried to terminate the DACA program without obeying the law,"" said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. ""Today's ruling is a huge step in the right direction.""
""America is and has been home to Dreamers who courageously came forward, applied for DACA and did everything the federal government asked of them,"" he added. ""They followed DACA's rules, they succeeded in school, at work and in business, and they have contributed in building a better America. We will fight at every turn for their rights and opportunities so they may continue to contribute to America.""
But the Department of Justice said the ruling doesn’t change the facts about the program.
""DACA was implemented unilaterally after Congress declined to extend these benefits to this same group of illegal aliens. As such, it was an unlawful circumvention of Congress, and was susceptible to the same legal challenges that effectively ended DAPA,"" the DOJ said in a statement.
During Tuesday’s bipartisan immigration meeting, President Trump said he would support a plan those in the room came up with, adding that he'd be open to taking on his political base in order to support a bipartisan agreement.
“I’ll take the heat off both the Democrats and the Republicans,” he said.
UPDATE: The White House and President Trump blasted the judge's ruling.
""We find this decision to be outrageous, especially in light of the President's successful bipartisan meeting with House and Senate members at the White House on the same day,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.
""An issue of this magnitude must go through the normal legislative process,"" she added. ""President Trump is committed to the rule of law, and will work with members of both parties to reach a permanent solution that corrects the unconstitutional actions taken by the last administration.""
Trump also weighed in.

On Tuesday, a San Francisco federal district court judge enjoined—that is, blocked—Trump’s attack on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. This injunction is temporary, in place until the court rules on the substance—or the merits—of the challenge to Trump’s plan to terminate DACA.
The good news is by granting a preliminary injunction the judge has indicated that he thinks DACA’s backers are likely to prevail. The bad news is that the injunction isn’t complete.
A federal judge in San Francisco issued a nationwide preliminary injunction Tuesday blocking the Trump administration’s decision to phase out a program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation. The injunction by U.S. District Judge William Alsup says those protections must remain in place for the nearly 690,000 immigrants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program while a legal challenge to ending the Obama-era program proceeds. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the decision to terminate the program on Sept. 5 and said no renewal applications would be accepted after Oct. 5. Under the administration’s plan, permits that expired after March 5 could not be renewed. But Alsup ruled that while the lawsuit is pending, anyone who had DACA status when the program was rescinded Sept. 5 can renew it, officials said.
The White House is in a rage over yet another defeat in court. (Granted, the threshold is low.)

The ruling, however, will not take effect pending review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The White House's third attempt at the travel ban targeted foreigners from six Muslim-majority countries, Venezuela, and North Korea.
Rather than take apart the entire ban, however, three members of the 9th Circuit ruled that only the prohibitions on ""foreign nationals who have a bona fide relationship"" within the United States should be stopped.
The dispute will not return to the Supreme Court until after a ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond, Va."

A three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said Trump had exceeded his authority in ordering that more than 150 million nationals of predominantly Muslim countries be barred from entering the United States.
The court faulted the president for failing to make a “legally sufficient” finding that entry of those barred would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States.”
Trump’s order “nullified” a federal immigration law passed by Congress and overrode “broad swaths of immigration laws that Congress has used its considered judgment to enact,” the court said.

The 9th Circuit, limiting an injunction against the ban by a Honolulu-based federal judge, said it should not be enforced against those who have a “bona fide relationship” to a person or entity in the United States. Those would include people with close family in the United States or a formal relationship with an entity, such as a university or corporation.
However, the Supreme Court this month ruled the president’s full travel ban could go into effect while legal appeals are weighed in lower courts.
Trump issued the ban in September, after two earlier efforts to restrict travelers were overturned by federal courts. The current version targets those coming to the United States from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.

Earlier this year, former DHS secretary and now White House chief of staff John Kelly said the DHS was evaluating the policy in an effort to prevent entire families from illegally entering the U.S. However, he quickly walked back on those statements and told Senate Democrats splitting children from their mothers wasn’t the intent.
The proposed plan means families could face separation because parents would be held at detention facilities prior to being deported and their children would remain under protective custody at juvenile shelters. Alternatively, they would remain with an approved sponsor.

The measure could also penalize migrants who live in the U.S. illegally and try to bring their children into the country, The Washington Post first reported Thursday.
Families apprehended at the border have historically been detained together. This new policy, according to The New York Times, would place parents in adult detention centers and children either in separate shelters or in the care of “sponsors.”
The new Department of Homeland Security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen hasn’t yet given her official approval, the Times reported. But the White House is on board, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement has approved the policy.
A DHS official said the agency has spent the year reviewing “procedural, policy, regulatory and legislative” changes to address illegal immigration. “The administration is committed to using all legal tools at its disposal to secure our nation’s borders and as a result we are continuing to review additional policy options.”
While DHS wouldn’t confirm or deny whether this specific policy had been reviewed, acting press secretary Tyler Houlton did say the agency is exploring “all possible measures” to protect children.
“It’s cruel for parents to place the lives of their children in the hands of transnational criminal organizations and smugglers who have zero respect for human life and often abuse or abandon children,” he said in a statement.
Immigration officials floated this type of draconian tactic in March, reasoning that it could sway people not to cross the border illegally, but never moved forward with the proposal. The decision may have been tied to a drop in illegal immigration in the first few months of Donald Trump’s presidency.
Then-DHS secretary John Kelly said the agency would only separate people in circumstances that presented a danger to the child.
People have the right to seek asylum and it is fully within U.S. and international law. Jen Smyers, Church World Service
Illegal border crossings then shot up in the second half of 2017. Official statistics show a 45 percent increase in family units and a 26 percent increase in unaccompanied children between October and November.
Yet some families have still been separated and prosecuted for improper entry, The Houston Chronicle found. The Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project, a legal service provider in Arizona, said it had identified 155 cases of family separation as of late October 2017. Lawyers have argued that the practice is unconstitutional, while the administration has repeated the claim that separation is sometimes necessary to protect children from smugglers.
Jose Demar Fuentes, for instance, entered the U.S. on Nov. 12 with a 1-year-old boy who authorities couldn’t confirm was his son due to a lack of identification documents, ICE said in a statement. Authorities placed the child in the care of the Department of Health and Human Services, while Fuentes was put in a detention center.
“Historically, some criminal smuggling organizations have paired non-relative children and adults with each other to minimize the chance of being detained if caught being smuggled across the border,” said ICE spokeswoman Liz Johnson.
Advocacy groups decried the possible measure.
“Formalizing a policy of forcibly separating families seeking asylum in the U.S. is inhumane, traumatic, and unnecessary and will not make America any safer,” said Michelle Brané, director of the Migrant Rights and Justice program at the Women’s Refugee Commission. “Such a policy flies in the face of domestic and international child welfare and refugee principles and laws and would even further undermine U.S. obligations to ensure policies protecting family unity.”
As we prepare to celebrate Christmas, we are painfully aware that these families are seeking safety just as Joseph, Mary, and the infant Jesus did long ago.” Jen Smyers, Church World Service
Jen Smyers, the director of policy and advocacy for the Church World Service’s refugee resettlement program, told HuffPost that the policy proposal is “inhumane.”
“Donald Trump’s war on immigrants has reached a sad new low. Separating families who are fleeing gang violence is unconscionable. And yet we find ourselves in the position of once again issuing a statement that we are against proposals that are clearly inhumane — just days before Christmas no less,” she said in a statement. “People have the right to seek asylum and it is fully within U.S. and international law. Especially as we prepare to celebrate Christmas, we are painfully aware that these families are seeking safety just as Joseph, Mary, and the infant Jesus did long ago.”
“The United States should not be in the business of separating children from their parents to fulfill some immoral campaign promise,” the statement continued. “CWS urges the administration to allow these families to have their case for asylum fully considered, and we stand ready to help them through legal services, materials goods, and solidarity through advocacy for their protection.”"

In a statement released Saturday, United States Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said the country’s participation in the Global Compact on Migration was incompatible with President Trump’s immigration policies.
""[Our] decisions on immigration policies must always be made by Americans and Americans alone,"" the statement reads. ""We will decide how best to control our borders and who will be allowed to enter our country. The global approach in the New York Declaration is simply not compatible with U.S. sovereignty.""
According to a report in Foreign Policy, Haley had wanted the U.S. to stay in the pact but was “overruled by the president,” diplomatic sources said.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson defended the administration’s decision, arguing it was not an isolationist move but a defense of the U.S.’s power to determine who crosses its borders.
“While we will continue to engage on a number of fronts at the United Nations, in this case, we simply cannot in good faith support a process that could undermine the sovereign right of the United States to enforce our immigration laws and secure our borders,” he said in a statement on Sunday.
The global pact in question was birthed September 2016, when the 196 U.N. member countries voted unanimously to adopt the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, a nonbinding declaration with a goal to enhance international cooperation in dealing with present and future waves of immigration. The declaration was made up of commitments designed to protect migrants’ human rights, enhance international border security cooperation and further prevent governments from detaining child immigrants. (Newsweek)
U.N.'s President of the General Assembly Miroslav Lajcák expressed regret over the U.S.’s decision, saying in a statement that no country ""can manage international migration on its own.""
""The role of the United States in this process is critical as it has historically and generously welcomed people from all across the globe and remains home to the largest number of international migrants in the world,"" the statement reads. ""As such, it has the experience and expertise to help ensure that this process leads to a successful outcome."""
